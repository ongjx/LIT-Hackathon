Gledhill LL[P] pursuant to a Claims Escrow Letter dated 13\u00a0June 2004.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">As the injunction granted by this court was to restrain HL from presenting a winding-up petition against MA, it is evident from the relief sought in the application that HL is not really seeking to vary the injunction as such, but the basis on which, or the factors that led, the court to grant the injunction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background facts</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"/>3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The background facts to the present application are fully set out in the Judgment. In summary, the parties had entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 13\u00a0June 2004 (which was later amended) (\u201cthe SPA\u201d), pursuant to which MA purchased the business and assets of HL for the sum of about US$267m. Of that sum, a US-dollar equivalent of S$25m (\u201cthe Escrow Sum\u201d) was paid pursuant to the terms of the SPA to Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP (\u201cthe Escrow Agent\u201d) to hold as security to meet any claims by MA for breach of warranties by HL. Any such claim had to be made by 30\u00a0September 2005, failing which the Escrow Sum would be released to HL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"/>4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A letter from MA and HL dated 13\u00a0June 2004 (\u201cthe Escrow Letter\u201d) and addressed to the Escrow Agent sets out the terms on which the Escrow Sum would be held and released. Paragraph\u00a02.1.5 of the Escrow Letter provides as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[I]f [HL] admits all or any part of the Amount Claimed or there is a determination of the amount payable in respect of the Relevant Claim by a final arbitral award made pursuant to clause\u00a021 of the [SPA], the Escrow Agent shall pay to [MA] the amount so admitted or determined (in the latter case less any money previously paid under paragraph\u00a02.1.4 in respect of the Relevant Claim) out of the amount standing to the credit of the Claims Escrow Account in accordance with the joint written instructions of [MA] and [HL] pursuant to paragraph\u00a02.3.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"/>5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 28\u00a0September 2005, MA made a warranty claim against HL which was quantified at S$34,472,740. In December 2005, MA commenced arbitration proceedings against HL (\u201cthe Arbitration\u201d). Based on its current pleadings in the Arbitration, MA is claiming a sum of at least S$30,993,960.18 plus interest and costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"/>6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prior to this date, HL had served a statutory demand on MA under s\u00a0254(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Companies Act (Cap\u00a050, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed) requiring MA to pay an undisputed debt of US$11,100,206.60 and S$112,667.17 (\u201cthe Undisputed Debt\u201d) in respect of steel supplied by HL to MA between July 2004 and June 2005. In response, MA applied for an injunction in Originating Summons No\u00a01996 of 2005 to restrain HL from commencing winding-up proceedings against MA on the basis that MA had a genuine cross-claim against HL for damages in excess of the Undisputed Debt for breach of warranties under the SPA, and that the commencement of the winding-up proceedings would cause irreparable damage to MA which had an ongoing business. The High Court dismissed MA\u2019s application. MA appealed to this court which allowed the appeal and granted the injunction. This court found, <em>inter alia</em>, that MA had a genuine cross-claim against HL which might or might not be less than S$34m and that the security of S$25m for the cross-claim did not reduce the amount of the cross-claim and could not be treated as payment of the cross-claim. Accordingly, until the cross-claim was decided in the Arbitration, it was not possible to conclude that MA\u2019s cross-claim was not equal to or in excess of the Undisputed Debt. Apart from the Undisputed Debt, there was also no evidence then that MA was insolvent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">HL\u2019s reasons for this application</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"/>7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HL\u2019s application is based on a material change in circumstances concerning, <em>inter alia</em>, the amount claimed by MA in the Arbitration and its financial condition. HL has made the following points in support of this application:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"/>(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if MA were to succeed in the Arbitration with respect to its cross-claim currently assessed at S$30,993,960.18, there would be at least US$5,254,877.97 (\u201cthe Balance Sum\u201d) left of the Escrow Sum, without taking into account the accrued interest to the Escrow Sum, after the Undisputed Debt has been set off against the cross-claim. (This is not disputed by MA.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"/>(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MA is now insolvent as its total liabilities exceed its total assets by US$236,527,949 as at 30\u00a0June 2006, and by US$241,365.691 as at 30\u00a0June 2007, and MA has been unable to pay all moneys owing to and demanded by its bankers since October 2006. (Again, MA has not disputed this statement, except to say that the bank creditors have not taken any step to wind it up.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"/>(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MA has agreed that it would set off any recovery for its warranty claim against the Undisputed Debt first, which would thereby leave the Balance Sum in the escrow account held by the Escrow Agent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"/>(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing before the High Court and the Court of Appeal on MA\u2019s application for the injunction, MA had offered to agree to the release of the sum of S$10m from the Escrow Sum to notionally equalise the cross-claim with the Undisputed Debt. There is no reason why, with the change in circumstances, MA should not agree, or be ordered by this court to agree, to the release of the Balance Sum to HL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Essentially, HL\u2019s reason for the present application is that it is wholly unjust and inequitable that HL be deprived of its right to immediate payment of the Balance Sum, and that this court should therefore grant its application. It bears noting that the Escrow Sum belongs to HL as it was part of the sale consideration under the SPA, although it is currently held by the Escrow Agent to meet MA\u2019s warranty claim which is the subject of the Arbitration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"/>8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HL has argued that the court has inherent jurisdiction to set aside an injunction, whether perpetual or interlocutory, should it become appropriate to do so, citing I\u00a0C\u00a0F\u00a0Spry, <em>The Principles of Equitable Remedies: Specific Performance, Injunctions, Rectification and Equitable Damages</em> (Lawbook Co, 7th\u00a0Ed, 2007) at p\u00a0382. HL contends that the present case is an appropriate one for this court to vary the injunction it has granted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">MA\u2019s objections</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"/>9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MA\u2019s position is that this court may not, and in any event should not, grant HL\u2019s application for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"/>(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The injunction granted by this court is the result of a final judgment, and this court is <em>functus officio</em> in the matter, according to <em>Singapore Court Practice 2006</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2006) at para\u00a042/1/9, and also <em>Godfrey Gerald QC v UBS AG</em> <nobr>[2004] 4 SLR 411</nobr>. Counsel for MA accepts the principle that a court has power to clarify or to make consequential or incidental orders in relation to a final judgment, but submits that HL\u2019s application is not such a case. MA also contends that there is in fact no change in circumstances as alleged by HL, but even if there were, it would not be a ground to vary the final judgment. Furthermore, MA contends that there is no change in the circumstances that have led this court to grant the injunction against HL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"/>(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if this court has the power to vary the judgment, HL is estopped from seeking a variation as the release of the Balance Sum was an issue which could have, and so ought to have, been raised at the hearing of CA\u00a048 (see <em>Singapore Court Practice 2006</em> at para\u00a018/19/14, pp\u00a0466\u2013467 and the authorities cited therein). The issue of the release of the Escrow Sum was raised by the parties and considered by this court in the context of HL\u2019s argument that the Escrow Sum of S$25m had reduced MA\u2019s claim of about S$34m to about S$9m, thereby causing MA\u2019s cross-claim against HL to be reduced to less than the Undisputed Debt. In view of this argument, MA was prepared to agree to the release of the sum of S$9m (or S$10m as computed by this court) in order to equalise the cross-claim and the Undisputed Debt (with the consequence that HL would not be able to justify commencing winding-up proceedings against MA). HL rejected this offer. However, this court went on to hold that as the Escrow Sum was held as security, it could not constitute payment, and therefore there could be no reduction in the amount of the warranty claim in fact and in law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"/>(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether or not HL is entitled to the release of the Escrow Sum or any part thereof before the final determination of MA\u2019s warranty claim is a question which properly ought to be referred to arbitration in accordance with the terms of cl\u00a021 of the SPA and the terms of the Escrow Letter. In any event, this court ought not to interfere with a matter which has been referred to arbitration, following <em>NCC International AB v Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd</em> <nobr>[2008] 2 SLR 565</nobr>, which held that the court\u2019s jurisdiction in matters that have been referred to arbitration was limited, and that it would not intervene in any matter which had been referred to arbitration unless the arbitral tribunal had no jurisdiction to grant the relief in the matter at hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"/>(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Balance Sum does not accurately represent the sum that would remain of the Escrow Sum if MA were to succeed in its entire warranty claim as MA is also claiming unliquidated damages and interest thereon, and until the claims are finally determined in the Arbitration, it would not be known how much would be left of the Escrow Sum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Our decision</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"/>10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not propose to examine in detail any of the grounds or reasons which HL has given to justify this application or any of the arguments advanced by MA by way of rebuttal, as HL\u2019s application is misconceived. In our view, it is clear from para\u00a02.1.5 of the Escrow Letter (see <a href=\"#p1_4\">[4]</a> above) that, unless it has been jointly instructed in writing by MA and HL, the Escrow Agent has no obligation to release the Escrow Sum or any part thereof. This is simply a matter of contract between the parties and the Escrow Agent and the court has no power to order the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Sum or any part thereof to either HL or MA unless the Escrow Agent is in breach of its obligations as an escrow agent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"/>11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HL has contended that the injunction should be varied as MA has agreed to set off any recovery for its warranty claim against the Undisputed Debt first, which would thereby leave the Balance Sum in the escrow account held by the Escrow Agent. However, HL has not argued that MA\u2019s agreement in this respect amounted to a variation of the terms of the escrow arrangement under the SPA that obliges MA, as a matter of contract, to agree to the release of the Balance Sum from the Escrow Sum. Even if that were the case, this court would not have the jurisdiction to hear such a claim. HL would have to commence separate proceedings against MA to enforce its contractual rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"/>12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HL is ostensibly asking this court to vary the injunction to make it conditional upon MA agreeing to the release of the Balance Sum to HL. However, in truth, it is not so much an application to vary an injunction but an attempt to entreat the court\u2019s assistance to order MA to agree to the release of the Balance Sum against the latter\u2019s wishes. The injunction granted by this court was to restrain HL from commencing winding-up proceedings against MA. The court has the power to dissolve or revoke this injunction where there is a material change of circumstances affecting its continuance, for example, where HL can produce evidence to show that MA is insolvent, which entitles HL to file an application to wind up MA. HL has not done so, although its counsel has stated that it is something that HL will seriously consider. But whether HL is entitled to have the existing injunction revoked is an issue which we need not consider as it is not before us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"/>13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may well be that, looking at the matter in the round, it may not seem fair or equitable to HL, as it claims, for it to be kept out of its money in the present situation where it is certain, or at least highly probable, that HL would be entitled to payment out of the Balance Sum when MA\u2019s warranty claim is finally determined in the Arbitration. However, in our view, that is not a relevant consideration because it is a natural outcome of HL\u2019s bargain with MA. HL has no equitable basis upon which it can complain. Indeed, it can even be said that the predicament that HL is now in is of its own making. In the previous proceedings, MA had offered to agree to the release of S$10m from the Escrow Sum to HL, but HL rejected it because it was of the view that it had good grounds to wind up MA. Unfortunately for HL, this court did not agree, and now HL is placed as a supplicant <em>vis-\u00e0-vis</em> MA for the release of the Balance Sum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"/>14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MA has argued that this court has no power to vary the injunction as it is a final order and not an interlocutory order, as contended by HL. It is not necessary for us to decide on this issue for the disposition of this application. In our view, the injunction is in substance a final and not an interlocutory injunction in the sense that it was the only relief that was sought in the proceedings, and was not a relief granted as part of ongoing proceedings. It is, however, a provisional order in that, if the basis of the injunction disappears or can no longer support it, such as if the arbitrator made an award on MA\u2019s cross-claim that is less than the Undisputed Debt to HL, there would be nothing to prevent HL from issuing another statutory notice to MA to pay the amount outstanding, failing which it would be entitled to take proceedings to wind up MA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"/>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MA has also contended that HL is estopped from raising this issue since the issue was argued by the parties and considered by the court in the previous proceedings. In our view, issue estoppel does not apply because there was no issue before the court in the previous proceedings which required the court\u2019s decision. MA\u2019s offer to agree to the release of S$10m from the Escrow Sum was within its contractual right and the rejection of the offer was also within the contractual right of HL. Nevertheless, HL has not been able to point out to us any principle of law that the court has the power to vary the existing injunction by imposing a condition on MA such as to interfere with its bargain with HL as to how and when the Escrow Sum should be paid. In fact, HL recognises the court\u2019s lack of judicial power to vary the injunction, as HL is not applying to have the injunction varied, but is persuading the court to order MA to agree to the release of the Balance Sum to HL as a condition for continuing the injunction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"/>16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The issue can be considered from another perspective. The application is to vary a final injunction to a conditional injunction (<em>ie</em>, conditional upon MA agreeing to the release of the Balance Sum to HL). Suppose MA does not perform the condition, what follows then? Presumably, the injunction would not continue, <em>ie</em>, it would be discharged. But, if it had that effect, it would be contrary to the purpose of the existing injunction, which is to restrain HL from winding up MA because HL has not been able to prove that MA is unable to pay its debt to HL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"/>17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We therefore agree with the general submission of counsel for MA that the circumstances in which this court granted the injunction have not changed. The Escrow Sum is still held as security for the cross-claim which has yet to be determined in the Arbitration. The Escrow Agent cannot release any part of the Escrow Sum to HL without the joint written instructions of HL and MA. This court could not interfere in the previous proceedings, and cannot interfere now, with the escrow arrangements between the parties. Although HL may consider it unjust that MA is now grossly over-secured with respect to its cross-claim, that, however, is a contingency inherent in any arrangement where security is given for an unliquidated claim which itself is also based on a contingency.

However, the she gave judgment\n\nfor Madam Lim against Lee Tat, for the balance of the purchase price.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The matter was taken to the Court of Appeal, which delivered its judgment on 6\n\nFebruary 1998. The Court of Appeal dismissed Fook Gees appeal. However, the appeal by Lee Tat was\n\nallowed, on the ground that Madam Lim never had any interest in the joint venture site, and\n\nconsequently had no interest in the Property which she could sell.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">On 4 June 1998, Madam Ching, as executrix of Mr Tans estate, commenced the\n\npresent proceedings against Mr Liu seeking to recover the sum of $1,368,420.71 (being the equivalent\n\nof US$642,451.04 at the agreed rate of exchange at the time of payment to Mr Liu) as money had and\n\nreceived, on the ground that the US$642,451.04 was paid to Mr Liu under a mistaken assumption that\n\nMadam Lim had an interest in the Property. After further litigation, Madam Ching managed to amend\n\nher statement of claim to include a claim for a remedial constructive trust.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The trial judge dismissed Madam Chings claims on two grounds. Firstly, it was\n\nheld that the true contracting parties in the sale of Madam Lims alleged interest to Lee Tat was\n\nMadam Lim (as the purported vendor) and Lee Tat (as the purported purchaser). As such, any action\n\nfor money paid under a mistake ought to have been brought by Lee Tat against Madam Lim. Mr Tans\n\nestate was not the proper plaintiff, and Mr Liu was not the proper defendant. Secondly, the trial\n\njudge held that in any case, the claim was time barred, and no remedial constructive trust arose.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Madam Ching thus brought the present appeal. On the question of the proper\n\nparties to the action, Madam Ching argued that the true contracting party to the joint venture was\n\nMr Liu, and that Madam Ching was purportedly conveyed the joint venture site as Mr Lius nominee.\n\nAs such, any interest in the joint venture site (and consequently in the Property) was supposed to\n\nhave been vested in Mr Liu. Conversely, when Lee Tat contracted to purchase the interest in the\n\nProperty from Mr Liu, it did so as Mr Tans nominee. Madam Ching thus contended that the true\n\ncontracting parties in the purported sale of Madam Lims interest in the Property to Lee Tat were\n\nactually Mr Liu and Mr Tan, so that the parties were properly constituted for the present action.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">With regards to the issue of time bar, Madam Ching contended that the mistaken\n\nassumption that Madam Lim had an interest in the Property was discovered only on 6 February 1998,\n\nwhen the Court of Appeal pronounced its judgment. Madam Ching therefore claimed that the limitation\n\nperiod began to run only as of that date, so her claim was not time-barred. Alternatively, Madam\n\nChing argued that when the Court of Appeal pronounced its judgment on 6 February 1998, Mr Liu could\n\nno longer retain the monies without his conscience being affected. She thus contended that the\n\nmonies became impressed with a remedial constructive trust as of 6 February 1998.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Held</p></b>, dismissing the appeal:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(1) The true contracting parties were Mr Tan and Mr Liu and nobody else. (\n\n  22-25). Madam Ching as the executrix of the estate of Mr Tan, was thus entitled to bring this\n\n  action against Mr Liu for the recovery of the sum paid to him. The proper parties were before the\n\n  court ( 26).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(2) The trial judge was correct in holding that the six year limitation period\n\n  found in s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act applied to Madam Chings claim ( 27). However, if the\n\n  monies sought to be recovered were paid under a mistake, then by virtue of s 29(1)(c) of the\n\n  Limitation Act, the limitation period would begin to run only as of the time when the mistake\n\n  could have been discovered ( 28).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(3) The contention that the mistake underlying the payment could not have been\n\n  discovered until the Court of Appeal delivered its decision on 6 February 1998 was rejected (\n\n  29). In the 1984 action brought by Madam Lim, Mr Tan asserted in his affidavit, filed on 1\n\n  February 1989, that Madam Lim had no interest in the Property. Thus, as of 1 February 1989, if not\n\n  earlier, he had already discovered the mistake. Even if the limitation period was postponed by\n\n  virtue of s 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, the time bar would have set in by 1\u00a0February\n\n  1995, at the latest ( 30). Section\u00a029(1)(c) of the Limitation Act states quite clearly that\n\n  time begins to run once the plaintiff could with reasonable diligence have discovered the\n\n  mistake. As far as s 29(1)(c) is concerned, it is the plaintiffs means of ascertaining the\n\n  mistake, and not what the court eventually decides, that is relevant in determining when the\n\n  limitation period begins to run ( 32).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(4) A remedial constructive trust arises where the court imposes a constructive\n\n  trust de novo on assets which are not subject to any pre-existing trust as a means of granting\n\n  equitable relief in a case where it considers just that restitution should be made ( 34). In\n\n  order for a remedial constructive trust to arise, the payees conscience must have been\n\n  affected, while the monies in question still remain with him. If the payee learns of the mistake\n\n  only after the monies have got mixed with other funds or dissipated, no constructive trust in\n\n  respect of these monies can arise. This is because there would no longer be an identifiable fund\n\n  for the trust to bite ( 36).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(5) On the facts of this case, there was no ground for imposing a remedial\n\n  constructive trust on Mr Liu in respect of the US$642,451.04 paid to him. The relationship between\n\n  Mr Liu and Mr Tan was only that of a vendor and purchaser and was wholly commercial. There was no\n\n  dishonest conduct on the part of Mr Liu. The sum was paid to Mr Liu in April 1981 with the intent\n\n  that he was free to deal with it as his money. It was never intended by either Mr Tan or Mr Liu\n\n  that it should be kept, and it had never been kept, distinct as an identifiable fund. On the basis\n\n  of Mr Khoos contention that Mr Liu discovered the mistake only in February 1998 or thereabouts,\n\n  there was a span of some 17 years and the sum paid to Mr Liu must have, in the meanwhile, been\n\n  spent or mixed with other funds of Mr Liu. There was no sum or fund on which a remedy of\n\n  constructive trust could be imposed by the court. The sum paid to Mr Liu was certainly not trust\n\n  property. There was, of course, an obligation on the part of Mr Liu to return the monies to Mr\n\n  Tan, but that was only a personal obligation ( 37).</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Case(s) referred to</p>\n\n</b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Kleinwort, Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Co </p></i>(1907) 97 LT 263 (refd)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Metal Und Rohstoff A G v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenerette Inc and Anor</p></i> [1990] 1 QB 391 (refd)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentrale v Islington London Borough County Council</p></i>\n\n[1996] AC 669 (refd)\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Legislation referred to</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed), ss 6(1)(a), 22(1), 29(1)(c)</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" color=\"#3322AA\" size=\"4\"><strong>JUDGMENT:</strong></font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\" color=\"#804040\">Grounds of Judgment</font></strong></p>\n\n<font face=\"Times New Roman\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\">1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was an appeal against the decision of Woo Bih Li JC, in\n\nwhich he dismissed the claim of the appellant, Madam Ching Mun Fong (Madam Ching) suing as the\n\nexecutrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee deceased (Mr Tan), against the respondent, Mr Liu Cho\n\nChit (Mr Liu) for the sum of $1,386,420.71 (being the equivalent of US$642,451.01 at the rate\n\nof exchange of S$2.13 to US$1) as money had and received. We dismissed the appeal and now give our\n\nreasons.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Background facts</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The material facts that led to this appeal stretch back to\n\nsome 27 years. The convenient starting point was 18\u00a0July 1972, when a company called Peng Ann\n\nRealty Pte Ltd (Peng Ann) purchased a large parcel of land situate at Kampong Chai Chee,\n\ncomprising lots 21-26, 4-4, 4-7, 112, 122, 123 and 221 of Mukim 28 having an area of 186.7 acres. At\n\nthat time, there were three shareholders of the company, and Mr Liu was one of them. He was also the\n\nmanaging director of the company. Two days after the sale and purchase agreement was made, there\n\nappeared in the government gazette a notification of compulsory acquisition by the government of two\n\nof the lots, namely, Lots 4-4 and 221. Being apprehensive of further compulsory acquisitions by the\n\ngovernment, Mr Liu and his co-directors decided to sell the remaining lots of land. In December\n\n1972, Mr Liu was introduced to Mr Tan, who was interested in purchasing the remaining lots.\n\nNegotiations took place between the two of them and eventually they reached an agreement. The\n\nagreement was signed on 23 January 1973, and it was made between Peng Ann and one of Mr Tans\n\nfamily companies, Lee Kai Investments Pte Ltd (Lee Kai) (then known as Collin Investment Pte\n\nLtd). Under the agreement, Peng Ann agreed to sell to Lee Kai three of the lots, namely, lots 21-26,\n\n4-7 and 123, having a total area of 178 acres, at the price of $2,050,000.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the meanwhile, Mr Tan and Mr Liu had orally agreed to\n\nenter into a joint venture to develop a small parcel of land containing an area of 5 acres, which\n\nwas within lot 21-26 and zoned residential (the joint venture site). The terms of this joint\n\nventure were subsequently reduced into four written agreements (collectively called the joint\n\nventure agreements). The agreement most material to the present appeal was the sub-sale agreement\n\nof the joint venture site expressed to be made between on the one hand Lee Kai, and on the other Mr\n\nLius wife, Madam Lim Siam Soi (Madam Lim), and Mr Tans daughter, Collin Tan (Collin).\n\nUnder this sub-sale agreement, Lee Kai agreed to sell the joint venture site to Madam Lim and Collin\n\nat the price of $50,000. The agreement was signed by Mr Tan on behalf of Lee Kai and Collin\n\nrespectively and by Mr Liu on behalf of Madam Lim. The other material joint venture agreements were\n\n(i) a pre-incorporation agreement, whereby Collin and Madam Lim agreed to incorporate a joint\n\nventure company, and (ii) a further sub-sale agreement, whereby Collin and Madam Lim agreed to\n\ntransfer to the joint venture company the joint venture site in exchange for shares to be issued by\n\nthat company to them respectively. These other agreements were also signed by Mr Tan on behalf of\n\nCollin and by Mr Liu on behalf of Madam Lim. However, neither Collin nor Madam Lim was aware of the\n\nagreements signed on their behalf or even of the joint venture itself.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sale of the three lots, 21-26, 4-7 and 123, by Peng Ann\n\nto Lee Kai was completed on 14 March 1973, and the lots were conveyed, on the direction of Mr Tan\n\npresumably on behalf of Lee Kai, to another company of Mr Tan, called Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd (Lee\n\nTat) (then known as Collin Development Pte Ltd).</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 23 July 1976, these three lots, except a portion\n\ncontaining an area of 4.2 acres on Lot 21-26, were compulsorily acquired by the government. The\n\nunacquired land comprised: (i) a portion of 3.7 acres of the joint venture site, and (ii) another\n\nportion of about 21,808 sq ft of land, which was immediately adjoining the joint venture site and\n\nzoned rural and was also part of Lot 21-26. The entire area of the unacquired land was subsequently\n\nresurveyed and was described as resurvey Lot 1606 (the Property).</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As it transpired, the joint venture entered into between Mr\n\nTan and Mr Liu was not implemented. In particular, neither Mr Tan nor Mr Liu took any step to\n\nimplement or carry out the terms of any of the joint venture agreements. Nor did their respective\n\nnominees, Madam Lim and Collin. Among other things, the proposed joint venture company was never\n\nincorporated. In the result, the Property remained vested in Lee Tat and was never conveyed to Madam\n\nLim and Collin or the proposed joint venture company. To all intents and purposes, the joint venture\n\nwas abandoned.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was only in 1980 that Mr Tans and Mr Lius interests\n\nin developing the Property revived. In that year they appointed a firm of architects to draw up\n\nplans for the development of a housing project on the Property and planning approval was sought.\n\nHowever, the negotiations between Mr Tan and Mr Liu to develop the property did not lead to\n\nfruition, as they could not agree on the proposed development; each had in mind a different type of\n\ndevelopment.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All this while, Mr Liu claimed that he or his wife, Madam\n\nLim, had an interest in the Property and he offered to sell this interest to Mr Tan. According to Mr\n\nLiu, he negotiated with Mr Tan on the price and Mr Tan agreed to purchase his or his wifes\n\ninterest in the Property at the price of $3.8 m net of tax and agreed to pay a sum of $2 m by\n\nApril 1981 and the balance two months later. On 23 April 1981, the parties met in Hong Kong, and Mr\n\nTan handed to Mr Liu two cashiers orders for the total sum of US$642,451.04 (being the equivalent\n\nof $1,368,420.70 at the exchange rate of S$2.13 to US$1). Mr Liu claimed that thereafter he asked Mr\n\nTan for payment of the balance of the purchase price, but no payment was made by the latter.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About two years later, on 25 August 1983, a Hong Kong\n\ncompany owned by Mr Tan and his wife, Madam Ching, called Fook Gee Finance Ltd (Fook Gee),\n\ncommenced an action in Suit No 4141 of 1983 (the 1983 action) against Mr Liu, claiming the sum\n\nof US$642,451.04 as a loan which, it was alleged, had been advanced to Mr Liu and seeking the\n\nrepayment of that amount. Mr Liu resisted the claim. His defence was that there was no loan made to\n\nhim by Fook Gee, and that the amount was part payment of the purchase price made by Mr Tan for Madam\n\nLims interest in the Property which Mr Tan had agreed to purchase at the price of $3.8 m net\n\nof tax.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About a year after Fook Gee had commenced the action, Madam\n\nLim commenced an action in Suit No. 4149 of 1984 (the 1984 action) against Lee Tat, Mr Tan and\n\nLee Kai, claiming, inter alia, the balance of the purchase price. She subsequently joined Collin as\n\nthe fourth defendant. The defence put forward on behalf of the defendants was essentially that Madam\n\nLim never had any interest in the Property. Mr Tan died before the action came on for trial and\n\nMadam Ching was appointed to represent his estate.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both the actions, were tried together before Lai Siu Chiu\n\nJ, as the events and the evidence were inextricably linked. The judge found that there was no\n\nevidence that the sum of US$642,451.04 was a loan by Fook Gee to Mr Liu, and that the sum came from\n\nthe funds of a Liberian import and export company called Komala Deccoff &amp; Co SA, which was owned\n\nby Mr Tan and another person. She therefore dismissed Fook Gees claim in the 1983 action. Turning\n\nto the claim of Madam Lim in the 1984 action, the judge found that Madam Lim did have an interest in\n\nthe Property, that Mr Tan had agreed to buy that interest at the price of $3.8 m, and that the sum\n\nof US$642,451.04 paid to Mr Liu was a part payment of the purchase price. She therefore entered\n\njudgment in her favour but only against Lee Tat for the balance sum, being the difference between\n\nthe purchase price of $3.8 m and the sum of $1,368,420.70 (being the equivalent of US$642,451.04 at\n\nthe exchange rate of S$2.13 to US$1) that had already been paid.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Against her decision, Lee Tat, Madam Ching representing the\n\nestate of Mr Tan and Lee Kai as well as Fook Gee appealed to this Court by two separate appeals.\n\nBoth the appeals were heard together. This Court dismissed Fook Gees appeal and affirmed the\n\ndecision below in the 1983 action. However, this Court allowed the appeal by Lee Tat, Madam Ching\n\nrepresenting the estate of Mr Tan and Lee Kai, and set aside the judgement in the 1984 action. The\n\nCourt held that Madam Lim had not established that she had any interest in the Property and thus\n\ndismissed her claim in the 1984 action: see <i>Fook Gee Finance Co Ltd v Liu Cho Chit and another\n\naction </i><a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=45552&amp;freetext=\">[1998] 2 SLR 121</a>.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a sequel to the decision of this Court, Madam Ching, as\n\nthe executrix of Mr Tans estate, on 4 June 1998, commenced the present proceedings in Suit No 862\n\nof 1998 against Mr Liu seeking to recover the sum of $1,368,420.71 (being the equivalent of\n\nUS$642,451.04 at the agreed rate of exchange at the time of payment to Mr Liu) as money had and\n\nreceived, on the ground that the US$642,451.04 was paid to Mr Liu under a mistaken assumption that\n\nMadam Lim had an interest in the Property, and/or that the consideration for the sum of\n\nUS$642,451.04 had totally failed.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the close of pleadings, Mr Liu applied to strike out\n\nthe statement of claim on the ground that it was frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of\n\nprocess, or alternatively on the ground that the claim was time barred. Upon being served with the\n\napplication to strike out, Madam Ching applied to have the statement of claim amended by the\n\naddition of an alternative claim for a constructive trust. Both the applications were heard before\n\nthe assistant registrar, who dismissed Madam Chings application to amend the statement of claim\n\nand allowed Mr Lius application to strike out the statement of claim. The assistant registrar\n\nheld that the claim was time barred under s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 ed), and that the\n\nfacts did not give rise to any constructive trust. Against the decision of the assistant registrar,\n\nMadam Ching appealed to a Judge in Chambers and the appeal was dismissed.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On further appeal, this Court allowed both the appeals, i.e<i>.</i>\n\nthe appeal against the striking out of the statement of claim and the appeal against the refusal to\n\nallow the amendment: see <i>Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee deceased) v Liu\n\nCho Chit &amp; another</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50779&amp;freetext=\">[2000] 1 SLR 517</a>. Hence, the action proceeded to trial. The trial judge\n\nat the conclusion of the hearing dismissed Madam Chings claim. Against that decision this appeal\n\nwas brought.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The appeal</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issues canvassed before us were the same as those\n\nraised and decided below, namely:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(1) whether the proper parties were before the court;</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(2) whether Madam Chings claim for the sum of $1,368,420.71 was time barred\n\n  by the Limitation Act; and</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(3) whether a remedial constructive trust arose on the facts of this case.</p>\n\n  <b><i>\n\n  </i></b></blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The proper parties</p>\n\n  \n\n<p align=\"justify\">17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the defences raised by Mr Liu in the pleadings was\n\nthat the proper parties were not before the court. First, Madam Ching as the executrix of the estate\n\nof Mr Tan was not the proper plaintiff. The reason for this was that it was established in the 1983\n\naction that the monies paid to Mr Liu came from a company, Komala Decoff SA, and therefore the\n\nmonies belonged to that company and accordingly that company should be the plaintiff. Secondly, Mr\n\nLiu was not the proper defendant. Here, the reason was that in the 1984 action, the judge found that\n\nMadam Lim had entered into an agreement, through Mr Liu, to sell her interest in the Property and\n\nthat Mr Liu was only the agent for Madam Lim, and therefore the proper defendant should be Madam Lim\n\nand not Mr Liu.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this issue, the judge held that the correct plaintiff\n\nshould be Lee Tat and that the correct defendant should be Madam Lim. The basis for this conclusion\n\nwas that the parties to the underlying agreement for the sale of Madam Lims alleged interest were\n\nMadam Lim and Lee Tat. The judge approached the issue thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">34 As regards the question as to who the correct plaintiff should be, I am of\n\n  the view that the material point is not where the monies came from or who paid the monies or who\n\n  the monies belonged to. The material point is who the contracting parties were. This would also be\n\n  the correct approach on the question as to who the correct defendant should be.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">35 For example, if X enters into a contract with Y to buy Ys interest in a\n\n  property and monies are paid pursuant to that contract to purchase Ys interest, it is\n\n  irrelevant as between X and Y whether the money came from Xs parents or a family company or a\n\n  financial institution. It is also irrelevant whether Y received the monies personally or not. X is\n\n  the correct person to sue and Y is the correct person to be sued if there is a total failure of\n\n  consideration on Ys part or if the payment was made pursuant to a mistake.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The judge then turned to what was found in the 1983 and 1984 actions by the High\n\nCourt, and said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">36 As I have mentioned, in the 1983 and 1984 actions, the trial judge had\n\n  found:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(a) that the monies were paid as part payment of Mdm Lims interest in the\n\n    Property pursuant to an agreement in April 1981 which Mdm Lim had entered, through Liu, to sell\n\n    her interest to Lee Tat, and</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(b) that Mdm Lim had acquired an interest in the Property and therefore there\n\n    was something for her to sell. Accordingly the trial judge had ordered Lee Tat, and only Lee\n\n    Tat, to pay the balance of the purchase price to Mdm Lim.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">37 When the Court of Appeal reversed the trial judges decision, it was only\n\n  on the basis that Mdm Lim had not established that she had, or had acquired, an interest in the\n\n  Property.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">38 The Court of Appeal did not disturb the other findings of the trial judge in\n\n  the 1983 and 1984 actions, i.e. that the purchaser was Lee Tat and the vendor was Mdm Lim.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">39 Accordingly, as regards the causes of action based on mistake of fact and\n\n  total failure of consideration, and monies had and received, I am of the view that in the light of\n\n  the findings of the trial judge in the 1983 and 1984 actions, the claims before me should have\n\n  been made by Lee Tat against Mdm Lim and not by Mdm Ching, as executrix of Tans estate, against\n\n  Liu.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">40 As for the cause of action based on a remedial constructive trust, I am of\n\n  the view that even though Liu had received the monies, the findings of the trial judge in the 1983\n\n  and the 1984 actions would also mean that Liu had received the monies on behalf of Mdm Lim.\n\n  Whether he had parted with the monies to Mdm Lim is a matter between them. It would then follow\n\n  that it is Mdm Lim, not Liu, who is to account as trustee for the monies even if I should find\n\n  that the Plaintiff has established a remedial constructive trust.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, Mr Michael Khoo, counsel for Madam Ching, argued\n\nthat the approach of the judge ignored the fact that the true contracting parties were Mr Tan and Mr\n\nLiu, which was accepted by Mr Liu in his evidence. On a true analysis of the facts, so far as Mr Liu\n\nwas concerned, Madam Lim was his nominee, and the interest in the Property which he thought had been\n\nacquired was his but held by Madam Lim as his nominee. In the negotiation with Mr Tan, Mr Liu acted\n\nin his personal capacity as the beneficial owner. As for Mr Tan, he also negotiated with Mr Liu as\n\nthe true owner of the Property and not as the agent for Lee Tat. The negotiations were conducted\n\nonly between Mr Tan and Mr Liu and the agreement was reached between them as the contracting\n\nparties, and the moneys were handed by Mr Tan to Mr Liu. Mr Khoo thus contended that the money\n\nshould be recovered from Mr Liu, not Madam Lim, and the action was properly brought by Madam Ching,\n\nas the executrix of the estate of Mr Tan, against Mr Liu.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, Mr C R Rajah, counsel for Mr Liu, argued\n\nthat the claim brought by Madam Ching against Mr Liu was for the return of some $1.3 m paid by\n\nmistake as part of the purchase price under a contract for the purchase of an interest in the\n\nProperty, which the vendor did not have. The contract was made between Mr Liu on behalf of his wife,\n\nas the vendor and Mr Tan on behalf of Lee Tat as the purchaser. If this sum had to be returned, it\n\nwould be by the vendor, Madam Lim, to the purchaser, Lee Tat. On this point, Mr Rajah relied on what\n\ntranspired in the 1983 and 1984 actions and what the High Court found in those actions. He thus\n\nmaintained that the proper plaintiff should be Lee Tat and the proper defendant Madam Lim.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We were unable to agree with Mr Rajah. It should be borne\n\nin mind that, in the 1984 action, before the High Court and on appeal before this Court, the\n\nquestion as to the proper parties for the recovery of the sum of $1,368,420.71 (being the equivalent\n\nof US$642,451.01) was not in issue. The main issue there was whether Madam Lim had an interest in\n\nthe Property. The High Court held that she had, but on appeal this Court found that she had not\n\nestablished that she had such interest. As Mr Khoo rightly pointed out, both the High Court and this\n\nCourt, at times in the course of the respective judgments, dealt with the alleged interest in the\n\nProperty as interchangeably that of Mr Liu and Madam Lim. Certainly this Court did not make any\n\nclear distinction between the two.</p>\n\n</font>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <font face=\"Times New Roman\">On the facts, there was no\n\ndoubt that both in the joint venture agreements made in January 1973 and in the sale of the alleged\n\ninterest in the Property in April 1981, the true contracting parties were Mr Tan and Mr Liu and\n\nnobody else. In respect of the joint venture, Mr Tan and Mr Liu were the ones who negotiated with\n\neach other and reached an agreement, which was then reduced into four separate agreements. So far as\n\nMr Liu was concerned, his wife, Madam Lim, was merely his nominee. In entering into the joint\n\nventure with Mr Tan in 1973, he made use of his wife as a nominal party to the joint venture\n\nagreements and signed the agreements on her behalf. She did not even know of the joint venture or of\n\nany of the agreements which were made in her name. The same applies to Mr Tan with regard to using\n\nhis daughter, Collin, and his family company, Lee Kai, in entering into the joint venture\n\nagreements. Mr Tan signed the agreements on behalf of Collin and Lee Kai respectively. Like Madam\n\nLim, Collin did not even know of the joint venture or any of the joint venture agreements. In truth\n\nand in fact, Mr Liu and Mr Tan were the contracting parties. As Mr Khoo submitted, and we agreed,\n\nnone of the nominal parties to the joint venture agreements had any independent thought or action as\n\nregards any of the agreements. Further, the subsequent dealings in relation to the proposed\n\ndevelopment on the joint venture site were between Mr Tan and Mr Liu only.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, in April 1981, when Mr Liu and Mr Tan\n\nnegotiated on the sale and purchase of what was then believed to be Madam Lims or Mr Lius\n\ninterest in the Property, only Mr Liu and Mr Tan were the parties involved in such negotiations. So\n\nfar as Mr Liu was concerned, his wife was the nominee and the interest acquired was his, and in the\n\nnegotiations he was acting in his personal capacity as the beneficial owner of that interest. The\n\nevidence of Mr Liu was that he negotiated with Mr Tan on the sale of that interest, and they reached\n\nan agreement, whereby Mr Tan agreed to purchase that interest at the price of $3.8 m, and in part\n\npayment of the purchase price, Mr Tan handed to him the two cashiers orders for the total amount\n\nof US$642,451.04. It was Mr Tan who made the payment. Where he got the funds from was immaterial.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if it can be said, as it was so argued on behalf of Mr\n\nLiu, that Madam Lim was the contracting party and that the sum of US$642,451.01 was a purported part\n\npayment, through Mr Liu, to Madam Lim of what was then believed to be her interest in the Property,\n\nand thus the payment was made to Mr Liu as the agent for Madam Lim, an action could still be\n\nbrought, as was brought here, to recover that sum from him. He was the sole recipient and\n\nbeneficiary of this sum, and the irrefutable evidence was that no part of that sum was ever paid to\n\nMadam Lim. He had kept this sum and treated it as his. He could properly be sued, as he was here,\n\nfor repayment of the money that was paid to him. There is authority for the proposition that, where\n\na payer makes a payment to an agent of the payee under a mistake of fact, the payer can recover the\n\npayment from the agent, if the agent has not paid it over to the principal: <i>Kleinwort, Sons &amp;\n\nCo v Dunlop Rubber Co </i>(1907) 97 LT 263, at 264 and 265. See also Goff and Jones, <i>The Law of\n\nRestitution </i>(5<sup>th</sup> edn) (1998) at pp 186 and 833.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning to Mr Tan, it was not in evidence that Mr Tan on\n\nbehalf of Lee Tat entered into the sale and purchase agreement with Mr Liu; there was only an\n\ninference that he probably did so, because the Property was then vested in Lee Tat. The undisputed\n\nevidence was that it was Mr Tan who negotiated with Mr Liu for the purchase of the alleged interest\n\nof Madam Lim or Mr Liu in the Property, that it was Mr Tan who agreed with Mr Liu on the price for\n\nthe alleged interest, and that it was Mr Tan who paid the monies to Mr Liu. The monies were clearly\n\nhis, and there was no evidence that the monies were Lee Tats. In any case, Lee Tat was his\n\nnominee and his company, and to all intents and purposes the Property was his. There was nothing to\n\nprevent him, on his own account, from purchasing what he believed was Madam Lims or Mr Lius\n\ninterest in the Property and made the part payment. Even if, acting as an agent of Lee Tat, he made\n\nthe payment to Mr Liu, he did so in the mistaken belief that Madam Lim or Mr Liu had an interest in\n\nthe Property, which in fact neither of them had. In such circumstances, that mistake was entirely\n\nhis and not his principals; nor could it be attributed to his principal, and he can recover the\n\nmonies from the payee: see Goff and Jones, <i>The Law of Restitution</i> (5<sup>th</sup> edn) (1998)\n\nat pp 183  184.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our judgment, Madam Ching as the executrix of the estate\n\nof Mr Tan, was entitled to bring this action against Mr Liu for the recovery of the sum paid to him.\n\nThe proper parties were before the court. On this point, with respect, we were unable to agree with\n\nthe judge below.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Periods of limitation</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to Madam Chings claim for money had and\n\nreceived for a total failure of consideration, the judge held that the cause of action was founded\n\non contract, and s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) applied. As the money was paid to Mr Liu\n\non or about 23 April 1981, the claim for the recovery of this sum had been barred by 22 April 1987.\n\nHe said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">72 I am of the view that such causes of action are founded on a contract for\n\n  the purpose of s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) which states:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">6 - (1) Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after\n\n    the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued:</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(a) actions founded on a contract or on tort; </p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">73 The monies which are the subject of this action were paid pursuant to the\n\n  oral contract to purchase Mdm Lims interest. The claim for monies had and received are also\n\n  founded on the oral contract in that it was not as though the monies were received on a basis\n\n  apart from the oral contract. In addition, the words founded on a contract are wide enough\n\n  to cover claims for the recovery of monies paid pursuant to a contract where the underlying\n\n  subject matter of the agreement did not exist or did not materialise.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"/>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">76 Accordingly these causes of action would be time-barred long before the\n\n  commencement of the present action on 4 June 1998.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The judges reasoning on this point was, with respect, correct. We agree with\n\nhim entirely.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to the claim for recovery of the monies on the\n\nground that the payment was made under a mistake. If the monies were paid under a mistake, then the\n\nlimitation period for Madam Lims action would have been postponed under s\u00a029(1)(c) of the\n\nLimitation Act. The provision states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">29(1) Where, in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is\n\n  prescribed by this Act </p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"/>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(c) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake, the period of\n\n  limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud or the mistake, as\n\n  the case may be, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was Mr Khoos contention that payment of the\n\nUS$642,451.04 was made under a mistake of law, and that this mistake could not have been discovered\n\nuntil this Court delivered its decision on 6 February 1998. He thus argued that the present\n\nproceedings, which were commenced in 1998, were not time barred. This argument was rejected by the\n\njudge below. We too rejected it.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was ample evidence before the court that Mr Tan\n\ndiscovered the mistake long before the judgment of this Court was delivered. The judge laid out the\n\nevidence as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">93 By a letter dated 4 May 1983, M/s Drew &amp; Napier, acting for Fook Gee,\n\n  demanded the return of the monies paid and interest from Liu on the basis that Fook Gee had lent\n\n  the monies to Liu.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">94 By a letter dated 11 May 1983, M/s Allen Yau, acting for Liu, replied. They\n\n  said that Liu had received on behalf of Mdm Lim the monies from Lee Tat. They also said that the\n\n  monies represented part payment of a purchase price for Mdm Lims interest in the Property.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">95 By a letter dated 27 July 1983, M/s Drew &amp; Napier asserted that Mdm Lim\n\n  never had any direct interest in the land.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">96 M/s Drew &amp; Napier must have been taking instructions from Tan as Tan was\n\n  controlling Fook Gee and Lee Tat.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">97 Lee Tats and Tans position was reiterated in paragraph 12 of the\n\n  Amended Defence (of the first three defendants), filed on 7 October 1987, in the 1984 action,\n\n  which states:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">12. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Statement of Claim are denied. Further the\n\n    Statement of Claim discloses no share which the Plaintiff owned at the said date which she could\n\n    agree to sell. The Defendants reserve the right to plead further hereto when the case is\n\n    properly particularised.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Apart from the pleadings filed in that action, Mr Tan himself asserted in his\n\naffidavit filed on 1 February 1989 that Madam Lim had no interest in the Property. Thus, as of that\n\ndate, if not earlier, he had already discovered the mistake. That was the most damning piece of\n\nevidence against the claim that the mistake was not discovered until the decision of this Court. The\n\njudge referred to Mr Tans affidavit and said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">99 Furthermore, paragraph 20(iii) of Tans affidavit affirmed on 1 February\n\n  1989 for the 1984 action stated:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(20) In June 1984, 11 years after the alleged Second Agreement was\n\n    purportedly entered into, the Plaintiff commenced this action to claim the following relief:-</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n\n      <p align=\"justify\">(iii) as against the 1st Defendants and/or myself, she claims specific\n\n      performance of a purported oral agreement made sometime in April 1981, under which the 1st\n\n      Defendants and/or myself allegedly agreed to buy her share in Lot 1606 of Mukim 28 for $3.8\n\n      million (hereinafter called \"the alleged oral Third Agreement\").</p>\n\n    </blockquote>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">100 Paragraphs 25(a) and 27 to 29 of the same affidavit stated:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(25) The Plaintiffs claim that the 1st Defendants are holding Lot 1606 of\n\n    Mukim 28 on trust for her and Collin Tan is also misconceived and cannot be sustained for the\n\n    following reasons:-</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n\n      <p align=\"justify\">(a) At all material times, the Plaintiff had <i>no proprietory interest in\n\n      the property</i>;</p>\n\n      <p align=\"justify\">(b) </p>\n\n      <p align=\"justify\">(c) </p>\n\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(26) </p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(27) Further, for any or all of the above reasons, the Plaintiff had <i>no\n\n    interest in the property</i> and, consequently, nothing for which she could allegedly sell to\n\n    the 1st Defendants or myself.</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(28) Besides, the 1st Defendants were at all material times the de facto and\n\n    de jure owner of the property (including Lot 1606 of Mukim 28). Even if the alleged oral Third\n\n    Agreement existed, which is denied, there was no consideration to support it.</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(29)  At the time of the alleged oral Third Agreement, she had no right\n\n    whatsoever in the property. For this reason, the alleged oral Third Agreement is invalid for\n\n    want of consideration. [Emphasis is added]</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In view of what had transpired, it was impossible to argue on behalf of Madam\n\nChing that Mr Tan could not have known about Madam Lims want of interest until this Courts\n\ndecision. At the latest, Mr Tan knew about it by 1 February 1989, when he affirmed the affidavit.\n\nEven if the limitation period was postponed by virtue of s 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, the time\n\nbar would have set in by 1 February 1995, at the latest.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following argument was, nevertheless, raised by Mr Khoo\n\non behalf of Madam Ching in the Appellants Case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">86. It was held by the Lords in <i>Kleinwort Benson v Lincoln County Council</i>\n\n  that the date when the local authority interest swap rate transactions proved to be void was when\n\n  the House of Lords made its decision in <i>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council</i>.\n\n  It is submitted that it is implicit if not express in that judgment that the cause of action to\n\n  recover a payment made under a mistake of law only accrues when the court determines that there is\n\n  a mistake of law.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">..</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">89. Therefore it was not until the Court of Appeal judgment of 6<sup>th</sup>\n\n  February 1998 that it was established that there had been a mistake in 1981 when the moneys were\n\n  paid over to the respondent. The mistake was therefore not \"discovered\" until the Court\n\n  of Appeal held that Mdm Lim/the respondents assumed interest was not an interest at all.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We were unable to accept this argument. The provision in\n\nquestion is s\u00a029(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, which states quite clearly that time begins to\n\nrun once the plaintiff could with reasonable diligence have discovered the mistake. As far as\n\ns 29(1)(c) is concerned, it is the plaintiffs means of ascertaining the mistake, and not what the\n\ncourt eventually decides, that is relevant in determining when the limitation period begins to run.\n\nWhile the fact that Madam Lim (or Mr Liu) had no interest in the Property was determined only after\n\nthis Courts decision on 6 February 1998, Mr Tan obviously knew about the true state of affairs\n\nlong before that date. In fact, he had already discovered the mistake by the time he affirmed his\n\naffidavit on 1 February 1989. In these circumstances, it was impossible to maintain that Mr Tan <i>could\n\nnot with reasonable diligence</i> have discovered that Madam Lim (or Mr Liu) had no interest in the\n\nProperty until only after the decision of this Court.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Remedial constructive trust</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Khoo finally argued that the court should impose a\n\nconstructive trust on the sum of US$642,451.01 paid to Mr Liu. His argument was along the following\n\nline. The money was paid to Mr Liu under a mistake, and although the mere receipt of the money in\n\nignorance of the mistake did not give rise to a trust in favour of Mr Tan at that time, the\n\nretention of the money by Mr Liu after he discovered the mistake, i.e. after this Court had\n\ndelivered its decision, gave rise to a constructive trust, because thenceforward his conscience was\n\naffected by the fact that the monies received by him had been paid for no consideration or under a\n\nmistake. It was the continued retention of such monies by Mr Liu that gave rise to this remedial\n\nconstructive trust, which the court should now impose, requiring Mr Liu to return the money to Mr\n\nTan. Mr Khoo then invoked s 22(1) of the Limitation Act, which provides:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a\n\n  beneficiary under a trust, being an action </p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">. . . . .</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(b) to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the\n\n  possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted to his use.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A remedial constructive trust arises where the court\n\nimposes a constructive trust de novo on assets which are not subject to any pre-existing trust as a\n\nmeans of granting equitable relief in a case where it considers just that restitution should be made\n\n(per Slade LJ in <i>Metal Und Rohstoff A G v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenerette Inc and Anor</i>\n\n[1990] 1 QB 391, 478. Slade LJ, however, said (at p 479) that the extent to which a constructive can\n\nproperly be treated as a remedy is far from clearly defined in the authorities, and said at the end\n\nof p 479:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">While we have had the benefit of very full argument on almost all other aspects\n\n  of the law involved in this case, we have neither heard nor invited comprehensive argument as to\n\n  the circumstances in which the court will be prepared to impose a constructive trust de novo as a\n\n  foundation for the grant of equitable remedy by way of account or otherwise. Nevertheless, we are\n\n  satisfied that there is a good arguable case that such circumstances may arise and, for want of a\n\n  better description, will refer to a constructive trust of this nature as a \"remedial\n\n  constructive\" trust.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Khoo relied on certain dicta of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in\n\n<i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentrale v Islington London Borough County Council</i> [1996] AC\n\n669. In that case, a bank in June 1987 entered into a swap contract with a local authority,\n\nand pursuant to that contract paid certain sums to the local authority. As a result of the decision\n\nof the House of Lords in <i>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fullam London Borough Council</i> [1992] 2 AC\n\n1, such a contract was ultra vires the authorities and therefore void. The bank therefore sought the\n\nrecovery of the sums from the local authority it had paid together with compound interest and\n\nsucceeded before the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. The local authority appealed to the House\n\nof Lords and one of the questions for consideration was whether the bank could get compound interest\n\non the sums recovered from the authority. As the general rule was that, in the absence of fraud,\n\nequity would not award compound interest except against trustees or other persons in a fiduciary\n\nposition in respect of profits improperly made, the bank sought to argue that the sums received by\n\nthe authority were held on trust for the bank. This argument was rejected and it was held, inter\n\nalia, that a recipient of monies under a contract subsequently declared void or as being ultra vires\n\ndoes not hold those monies on a resulting trust and that equity would not award the bank compound\n\ninterest in aid of their common law claim of restitution. In the course of his speech, Lord\n\nBrowne-Wilkinson discussed the possibility of a remedial constructive trust being available and\n\ndistinguished the remedial constructive trust from the normal institutional constructive trust as\n\nfollows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Under an institutional constructive trust, the trust arises by operation of law\n\n  as from the date of the circumstances which give rise to it: the function of the court is merely\n\n  to declare that such trust has arisen in the past. The consequences that flow from such trust have\n\n  arisen (including the possibly unfair consequences to third parties who in the interim have\n\n  received the trust property) are also determined by rules of law, not under a discretion. A\n\n  remedial constructive trust, as I understand it, is different. It is a judicial remedy giving rise\n\n  to an enforceable equitable obligation: the extent to which it operates retrospectively to the\n\n  prejudice of third parties lies in the discretion of the court.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">And later at p 716 his Lordship said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Although the resulting trust is an unsuitable basis for developing proprietary\n\n  restitutionary remedies, the remedial constructive trust, if introduced into English law, may\n\n  provide a more satisfactory road forward. The court by way of remedy might impose a constructive\n\n  trust on a defendant who knowingly retains property of which the plaintiff has been unjustly\n\n  deprived. Since the remedy can be tailored to the circumstances of the particular case, innocent\n\n  third parties would not be prejudiced and restitutionary defences, such as change of position, are\n\n  capable of being given effect. However, whether English law should follow the United States and\n\n  Canada by adopting the remedial constructive trust will have to be decided in some future case\n\n  when the point is directly in issue.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverting to the case at hand, the judge below held that\n\neven if remedial constructive trust applies in Singapore, no remedial constructive trust arose in\n\nthis case. He said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">141  I am satisfied that on the particular facts before me, the Plaintiff\n\n  has failed to establish such a trust.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">142 The Plaintiffs case was that the payment was made pursuant to a contract\n\n  of sale of Mdm Lims interest. The Court of Appeal has found that Mdm Lim did not have such an\n\n  interest.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">143 The Plaintiff is in no better position than the depositors in <i>Sinclair v\n\n  Brougham</i> where the monies were paid pursuant to a void contract.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">144 As in that case, when the monies were paid to purchase Mdm Lims\n\n  interest, it was intended that she should be free to deal with the monies and she was entitled to\n\n  mix the monies with other monies of hers or anyone else for that matter. Whether it was in fact\n\n  mixed is irrelevant.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">145 The Plaintiffs cause of action is one based on a total failure of\n\n  consideration and not trust. Mdm Lim has been unjustly enriched and was accountable for the monies\n\n  received but the relationship was exclusively commercial and the monies were and are not trust\n\n  property.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">We agree with these observations of the judge. A remedial constructive trust is a\n\nrestitutionary remedy which the court, in appropriate circumstances, gives by way of equitable\n\nrelief. In order for a remedial constructive trust to arise, the payees conscience must have been\n\naffected, while the monies in question still remain with him. If, as was the situation in the <i>Westdeutsche</i>\n\ncase, the payee learns of the mistake only after the monies have got mixed with other funds or\n\ndissipated, no constructive trust in respect of these monies can arise. This is because there would\n\nno longer be an identifiable fund for the trust to bite. It is significant to note that the\n\nplaintiff bank in the <i>Westdeutsche</i> case expressly disavowed any intention of pursing a claim\n\nin constructive trust. The reason for their not having done so was stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson\n\nat p 707:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">This is not a case where the bank had any equitable interest which pre-dated\n\n  receipt by the local authority of the upfront payment. Therefore, in order to show that the local\n\n  authority became a trustee, the bank must demonstrate circumstances which raised a trust for the\n\n  first time either at the date on which the local authority received the money or at the date on\n\n  which payment into the mixed account was made. <i>Counsel for the bank specifically disavowed any\n\n  claim based on a constructive trust. This was plainly right because the local authority had no\n\n  relevant knowledge sufficient to raise a constructive trust at any time before the moneys, upon\n\n  the bank account going into overdraft, became untraceable. Once there ceased to be an identifiable\n\n  trust fund, the local authority could not become a trustee</i>: <i>In re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd.</i>\n\n  [1995] 1 A.C. 74. Therefore, as the argument for the bank recognised, the only possible trust\n\n  which could be established was a resulting trust arising from the circumstances in which the local\n\n  authority received the upfront payment. [Emphasis is added]</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">37.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning to the facts of this case, we found that there was\n\nno ground for imposing a remedial constructive trust on Mr Liu in respect of the sum US$642,451.01\n\npaid to him. The relationship between Mr Liu and Mr Tan was only that of a vendor and purchaser and\n\nwas wholly commercial. There was no dishonest conduct on the part of Mr Liu The sum was paid to Mr\n\nLiu in April 1981 with the intent that he was free to deal with it as his money. It was never\n\nintended by either Mr Tan or Mr Liu that it should be kept, and it had never been kept, distinct as\n\nan identifiable fund. On the basis of Mr Khoos contention that Mr Liu discovered the mistake only\n\nin February 1998 or thereabouts, there was a span of some 17 years and the sum paid to Mr Liu must\n\nhave, in the meanwhile, been spent or mixed with other funds of Mr Liu. There was no sum or fund on\n\nwhich a remedy of constructive trust could be imposed by the court. The sum paid to Mr Liu was\n\ncertainly not trust property. There was, of course, an obligation on the part of Mr Liu to return\n\nthe monies to Mr Tan, but that was only a personal obligation. In our judgment, no remedial\n\nconstructive trust could and should be imposed on the facts of this case.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p

Subsequently, he discontinued the common law action and made a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation again. The new claim for workmen\u2019s compensation was made outside the statutory time limit of one year (\u201cthe limitation period\u201d) applicable to claims under the Act. The Commissioner for Labour (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) rejected the new claim on the ground that the workman had failed to show reasonable cause for not making his claim within the limitation period.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The workman applied to the High Court for leave for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, but the judge below (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) refused to grant leave (see <i>Pang Chen Suan v Commissioner for Labour</i> <nobr>[2007] 4 SLR 557</nobr>).

The factory belonged to D-Sign Advertising, a sole proprietorship carrying on the business of making signboards. At that time, one of the employees was carrying out hot works with an oxygen gas cylinder. The appellant, Pang Chen Suan (\u201cPang\u201d), was employed as a supervisor with D-Sign Advertising. This explosion caused the deaths of Pang\u2019s employer, the employer\u2019s wife and two other persons. Several others, including Pang, sustained serious injuries. Pang suffered fractures of his leg, lacerations and burns on his left forearm. He underwent surgery five times and was found to have 18% permanent disability.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pang made a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation under the Act (\u201cthe Compensation Claim\u201d) on 5\u00a0March 2004. On 17\u00a0August 2004 (seven months after the accident) Pang withdrew the Compensation Claim in order to commence a common law action against his deceased employer. He filed a writ in the High Court on 27\u00a0December 2004 (\u201cthe Writ\u201d) within a year after the accident, but the Writ could not be served on the estate of the deceased employer as letters of administration had not been extracted by the personal representatives.

In the course of the inquiry, he made observations which suggested that the manufacturers of oxygen gas cylinders could be at fault in not complying with blow-down procedures, when installing oxygen into the tanks, to rectify any contamination in the tanks. Pang\u2019s lawyers took the view that the Coroner\u2019s observations would make it difficult for Pang to prove negligence against his employer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another prior unrelated event also gave Pang\u2019s solicitors reason not to proceed under the common law. In a letter dated 8\u00a0October 2004, the employer\u2019s insurers, NTUC Income, denied liability on the ground that the policy did not cover the carrying out of hot works at D-Sign Advertising\u2019s factory. In these circumstances, and coupled with the fact that the deceased employer had left behind two young children, Pang decided not to proceed with his action which, if he had succeeded, would only result in the estate of his employer being personally liable in damages for his injuries. For all these reasons, Pang allowed the Writ to lapse on 20\u00a0December 2005.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 12\u00a0January\u00a02006, Pang wrote to the Chief Inspector of Factories (\u201cthe Chief Inspector\u201d) at the Ministry of Manpower (\u201cMOM\u201d) for a copy of the investigation report. The Chief Inspector replied on 21\u00a0February 2006 and, based on legal advice, rejected Pang\u2019s request for the investigation report.

Even where the workman succeeds in his action against the employer, there is no certainty that the employer has the financial means to pay the damages unless the employer is adequately insured. At the beginning of the 19th century in England, with the growth of industrialisation, there was a felt need for legislation to protect workmen and their families from such hazards. In 1897, the English parliament enacted the first workmen\u2019s compensation legislation to fill this need by introducing no-fault claims against employers. The statutory scheme provided that every worker injured or killed in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment was entitled to compensation irrespective of fault. Workmen\u2019s compensation was first introduced in the Straits Settlements in 1929. During the first reading of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bill (Bill\u00a0502 of 1929) on 25\u00a0March 1929, the Attorney-General Michael Henry Whitley said (see Straits Settlements, Colony of Singapore, <i>Proceedings of the Legislative Council</i> (25\u00a0March 1929) at pp\u00a0B30 and B33):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he common law imposes a duty on an employer to see that his workmen shall not suffer injury in consequence of his personal negligence or through his failure properly to superintend the undertaking upon which they are engaged. A breach of this duty causing personal injury to a workman gives the workman a right to compensation against the employer. If death ensues in consequence of such an injury, compensation may be recovered from the employer under the Civil Law Ordinance by the wife, husband, parent or child of the deceased workman. But, except to that limited extent, compensation for personal injury cannot be recovered by a workman in this Colony from his employer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is the object of this Bill to remedy that defect and to enable a workman to recover in respect of any personal injury caused by any accident arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, subject to certain exceptions. \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The amount of compensation conferred by this Bill is additional to and not in substitution for the common law rights and the rights given by the Civil Law Ordinance to which I have referred. But of course the workman must not be permitted to obtain one award from the Court and another from the Commissioner in respect of the same injury. Also he should not be encouraged to bring speculative actions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Bill was ultimately passed in 1932 as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Ordinance (Ord\u00a09 of 1932).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since then, the Act remained substantially the same until 1975 when it was amended to improve the protection given to workers by, <i>inter alia</i>, increasing the amount of compensation payable under the Act and shortening the timelines within which employers had to pay out workmen\u2019s compensation. The amendments reflected the concern of the Government for the general welfare of workers. In answering questions on how the Act could be enhanced, Mr\u00a0Sia Kah Hui, then Minister of State for Labour said (see <i>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</i> (7\u00a0March 1972) vol\u00a031 at col\u00a0465):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">According to the Act, the injured worker is entitled to compensation, regardless of whether or not he is responsible for the accident. Members will no doubt agree that this is a practical and realistic approach to the question of compensation. However, the worker has the option of proceeding to claim damages in the Civil Courts if he feels that the liability for the accident can be attributed to the employer or a third party.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further, Parliament recognised that an injured workman would have foremost in his mind the quantum of compensation or damages he was entitled to recover in deciding whether to take up a common law action or to make a claim under the Act (see <i>Report of the Select Committee on the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bill</i> (Parl\u00a02 of 1975, 15\u00a0July 1975) (Chairman: Dr\u00a0Yeoh Ghim Seng) at Appendix\u00a0III, p\u00a0B9, col\u00a018. Accordingly, the Act gave him the choice to elect which remedy he wished to have. It was not intended to penalise the workman for choosing to commence a common law action in preference to workmen\u2019s compensation which was invariably lower than damages.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Act was again amended in 1981, 1990 and 2008 without affecting the main objective and basic principles of the Act. Indeed, one amendment enhanced the right of the workman to pursue his common law claim. In introducing amendments to s\u00a011(1) of the Act, the then Acting Minister for Labour Mr Sia Kah Hui said (at <i>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</i> (28\u00a0November 1980) vol\u00a039 at col\u00a01561\u20131562):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Finally, section\u00a033(2) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act allows a workman to claim compensation, having failed in his claim at common law, provided he filed his common law claim within the time specified in section\u00a011, that is, six months from the happening of the accident. A number of claimants have indicated that this period gives them very little time to decide whether to claim at common law or under the Act. Clause\u00a03 of the Bill, therefore, seeks to extend this period from six months to one year.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In other words, the Legislature extended the limitation period under s\u00a011(1) of the Act in the interests of workers in order that they would be given more time to decide whether to sue for damages under the common law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2008, the Act was amended again to extend its application to other categories of workmen, update compensation norms and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the compensation process. In his speech in Parliament at the second reading of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation (Amendment) Bill (Bill\u00a050 of 2007) (see <i>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</i> (22\u00a0January 2008) vol\u00a084), Mr\u00a0Gan Kim Yong, then Minister of State (Education and Manpower), reiterated the objective of the Act in the following words:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act \u2026 provides a simpler and quicker way to settle compensation claims by avoiding protracted legal proceedings. An employee claiming under the Act is not required to prove that his employer is at fault. He only needs to show that his injury was sustained in the course of work. There is also a fixed formula in the Act on the amount of compensation to be awarded, and capped so that the financial liability on the employer is limited. The no-fault claims and prescribed amounts of compensation serve to facilitate and expedite claims under the [Act]. However, employees can still choose not to claim under the [Act], but instead to pursue damages through the civil courts under the common law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The statutory scheme</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having stated the legislative objective of the Act, it is now necessary to examine the provisions of the Act to see how they implement that objective. For present purposes, the relevant provisions are ss\u00a03, 7, 11, 12, 13, 23, 24 and 33 of the Act, the substance of which we now summarise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a03(1) of the Act provides that if in any employment, personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">with the provisions of the Act. A workman is entitled to compensation even if he himself caused the accident or the employer was not responsible for the accident. The only condition that has to be satisfied is that the accident must arise</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">out of and in the course of the employment. Section\u00a07 of the Act provides that the amount of compensation payable shall be in accordance with the provisions of Third Schedule to the Act, which, because it is based on no-fault liability, is pitched lower than common law damages. To cover the employer\u2019s liability, s\u00a023 of the Act requires every employer to insure and maintain insurance with a licensed insurer against any liability which he may incur under the Act to any workman employed by him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a011 of the Act governs the procedural requirements for giving notice and making a claim.

The appeal before us is concerned with whether Pang has shown \u201creasonable cause\u201d in making a fresh claim outside the limitation period. As we shall see, s\u00a011(4) is not free from interpretational difficulties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a012 of the Act provides that every employer shall give notice to the Commissioner and to his insurer in writing of the occurrence of any accident within the periods specified therein. Section\u00a013 of the Act requires the employer to have the injured worker medically examined at the employer\u2019s expense. Section\u00a024 of the Act empowers the Commissioner to assess and make an order on the amount of compensation payable to any person.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It can be readily seen from these provisions that the relevant parties whose interests are involved in the operation of the statutory scheme are: (a)\u00a0the injured workmen; (b)\u00a0the employers; (c)\u00a0the insurers; and (d)\u00a0the Commissioner. The Act regulates the respective rights and liabilities of the first three parties in different ways. The workman has an absolute right to workmen\u2019s compensation, whether or not he was at fault. The employer is liable once it is proved that the injury to the workman arose out of and in the course of employment under him. The insurer is similarly liable once the employer is liable. To ensure that the interests of the employer and the insurer are protected, the accident has to be notified to them within certain prescribed times so that they can investigate the accident to determine whether they are at financial risk, thereby enabling them to manage such risks properly. This is reinforced by the obligation of the workman to make a claim for compensation within a year unless he has reasonable cause for not doing so. The role of the Commissioner is to facilitate the payment of workmen\u2019s compensation to injured workmen (that being the objective of the Act) but, at the same time, taking into account the interests of the employers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective of the Act is to provide no-fault compensation to injured workmen as an alternative remedy to common law damages which are invariably higher than workmen\u2019s compensation. However, the Act does not replace or substitute compensation for damages if the workman prefers to sue for damages. But, the Act also limits the rights of workmen to compensation if they have obtained damages for the same injuries in a court of law so as to prevent the workman from obtaining double compensation for his injuries. Section\u00a033 of the Act makes provision for this objective by providing as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Limitation of workman\u2019s right of action</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33</span></b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">.\u2014(1)\u00a0Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to confer any right to compensation on a workman in respect of any injury if he has instituted an action for damages in respect of that injury in any court against his employer or if he has recovered damages in respect of that injury in any court from his employer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No action for damages shall be maintainable in any court by a workman against his employer in respect of any injury \u2014</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>a</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if he has applied to the Commissioner for compensation under the provisions of this Act; or</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>b</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if he has recovered damages in respect of the injury in any court from any other person.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If an action is brought within the time specified in section 11 in any court to recover damages independently of this Act for injury caused by any accident and it is determined in the action or on appeal that the injury is one for which the employer is not liable but that he would have been liable to pay compensation under the provisions of this Act, the action shall be dismissed; but the court shall, if the workman so chooses, proceed to assess the compensation and may deduct therefrom all or any part of the costs which, in its judgment, have been caused by the workman instituting the action instead of proceeding under this Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Scope of section\u00a033</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before we discuss the scope of s\u00a033 of the Act, it is necessary to emphasise that the Act leaves it entirely to the workman to choose whether he should claim for compensation under the Act or sue for common law damages. A workman may apply for workmen\u2019s compensation without suing at common law or <i>vice versa</i>. The basic principle is that the Act is not intended to allow a workman to recover compensation under the Act or common law damages for the same injury. The object of the Act is not to give to workmen the right of double recovery of compensation and damages for the same injury but to give them compensation even if the employers have not failed in their common law or statutory duties to provide them with a safe working environment, or if they themselves are negligent in the performance of their work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The case of</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chua Ah Beng v Commissioner for Labour</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, whilst the Act is clear in prohibiting double recovery of compensation and damages for the same injury, it is not so clear as to the extent and the manner in which it prohibits concurrent proceedings. In</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chua Ah Beng v Commissioner for Labour</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\"><nobr>[2002] 4 SLR 854</nobr> (\u201c<i>Chua Ah Beng</i>\u201d), Tay Yong Kwang\u00a0JC held that s\u00a033(1) prohibited a workman who had started a common law action from making a compensation claim under the Act, and that the workman must discontinue the action if he wished to apply for compensation under the Act. At [37] of <i>Chua Ah Beng</i>, he said:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I would qualify the \u2018no double proceedings, no double compensation\u2019 principle advanced in submissions to read as \u2018no concurrent proceedings, no double proceedings when workman succeeds, no double compensation\u2019.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The problem with s\u00a033 is not that it does not prohibit concurrent proceedings but that it is not clear what a concurrent proceeding is for that purpose. The question is whether a compensation claim held in abeyance by the Commissioner pending a subsequent common law claim is a concurrent proceeding or whether a stayed action pending a compensation claim is a concurrent proceeding. In</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chua Ah Beng</span></i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, Tay\u00a0JC held that a compensation claim held in abeyance (and in that case, the evidence showed that the Commissioner had agreed to hold the workman\u2019s claim in abeyance to allow him to pursue his common law claim) was a concurrent claim and therefore he had to treat one or the other as having been withdrawn. In that case, as the common law claim proceeded all the way to the Court of Appeal, Tay\u00a0JC held that the compensation claim had been deemed to have been withdrawn; otherwise it would have meant that the court proceedings were a nullity. At [38] and [39] of <i>Chua Ah Beng</i>, Tay\u00a0JC reasoned:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The plaintiff [Chua] is asking the court to order the Commissioner for Labour to reinstate and to assess his claim. The defendant very candidly informs me that the practice adopted thus far is to allow applications under the [Act] (such as the plaintiff\u2019s in this case) <i>to lie dormant while the workman pursues his remedy in court. This practice obviously cannot stand in the light of what I have said about s\u00a033(2)(a) of the [Act]. As long as an application exists before the Commissioner for Labour, whether it is active or dormant, the plaintiff cannot maintain his action in court</i>. In \u2026 <i>Ying Tai Plastic</i> [<i>&amp; Metal Manfuacturing (S) Pte Ltd v Zahrin bin Rabu</i> <nobr>[1982-1983] SLR 117</nobr>]<i>\u2026</i>, the Court of Appeal said the \u2018right to compensation under the Act <i>lies dormant while he pursues his common law action</i>\u2019. It is the \u2018right to compensation\u2019 and not \u2018the claim filed\u2019 that lies dormant. The Court of Appeal also made it clear that the right to maintain a court action revives only when the application under the [Act] is withdrawn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 However, s\u00a033(2)(a) of the [Act] is a mandatory statutory bar to court proceedings. The only logical solution in these circumstances is to hold that the plaintiff is <i>deemed to have withdrawn</i> his claim under the [Act] when he informed the Commissioner for Labour that he was going to commence an action in court. There is therefore no application before the Commissioner for Labour to restore for assessment and no order of certiorari or of mandamus will therefore be made.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is, of course, arguable that Tay\u00a0JC\u2019s solution was not the <i>only</i> logical conclusion on the facts of that case. There were two other possible solutions available to him. The first was to hold that the court proceedings were a nullity, as Kan Ting Chiu\u00a0J did in <i>Saldur Rahman v Mayban General Assurance Bhd</i> <nobr>[2005] 3 SLR 277</nobr> (\u201c<i>Saldur Rahman</i>\u201d). The second was to hold that a claim held in abeyance did not fall within s\u00a033(1) or s\u00a033(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act on the ground that those two provisions were applicable only to current claims and that a suspended claim was not a current claim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The case of</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Rahenah bte L\u00a0Mande v Baxter Healthcare Pte Ltd</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tay\u00a0JC\u2019s decision in <i>Chua Ah Beng</i> follows the earlier decision of Judith Prakash\u00a0J in <i>Rahenah bte L\u00a0Mande v Baxter Healthcare Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2002] SGHC 320</nobr> (\u201c<i>Rahenah</i>\u201d). In that case, R, the injured worker, made a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation. However, because of the delay in processing her claim, she commenced a common law action against her employer, after giving notice to the Commissioner of her intention to do so, but without withdrawing her compensation claim. The employer applied to strike out R\u2019s action on the ground it was a nullity by virtue of s\u00a033(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Cap\u00a0354, 1985\u00a0Rev Ed). Prakash\u00a0J ordered the action to be struck out on the ground that she was bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Ying Tai Plastic &amp; Metal Manufacturing (S) Pte Ltd v Zahrin bin Rabu</i> <nobr>[1982-1983] SLR 117</nobr> (\u201c<i>Ying Tai Plastic</i>\u201d) to hold that R\u2019s action was a nullity. Of course, if Prakash\u00a0J was bound by <i>Ying Tai Plastic</i>, so was Tay\u00a0JC in <i>Chua Ah Beng</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The case of</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Saldur Rahman</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Saldur Rahman</i>, Kan\u00a0J followed the decision of Prakash\u00a0J in <i>Rahenah</i>, and held that the common law action in that case (which the workman had commenced <i>after</i> he had made a claim for compensation under the Act but without withdrawing it expressly) was a nullity. The reason why he held that the action was a nullity was because he found, as a fact, that the workman had not withdrawn his compensation (unlike the workman in <i>Chua Ah Beng</i>, which Kan\u00a0J distinguished on that very ground). <i>Saldur Rahman</i> was therefore decided on the basis that a suspended claim is a current proceeding in the context of the prohibition against concurrent proceedings, a point that was not decided by this court in <i>Ying Tai Plastic</i>, which we will now discuss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The case of</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Ying Tai Plastic</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Ying Tai Plastic</i> ([28] <i>supra</i>), Z (the worker) had affixed his thumbprint to a document to apply for workmen\u2019s compensation for personal injuries. Subsequently, he sued for damages at common law. Z\u2019s employer raised a preliminary issue that the common law action was barred by s\u00a033(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Act\u00a025 of 1975) (\u201cthe 1975 Act\u201d) (now s\u00a033(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act). The High Court held that Z was not precluded from maintaining the action if he withdrew his claim for compensation (see <i>Zahrin bin Rabu v Ying Tai Plastic &amp; Metal Manufacturing (S) Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1982-1983] SLR 301</nobr>). On appeal, the employer argued that the mere application for compensation under the 1975 Act abrogated the workman\u2019s right to an action for damages at common law and that an application for compensation could not be withdrawn. The Court of Appeal, after stating that the employer\u2019s liability to pay compensation under the 1975 Act was absolute, said (at 121, [25]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Under s\u00a033(1)(a) [now s\u00a033(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act] the worker is debarred from bringing a common law action for damages so long as there is an application by the workman before the Commissioner for compensation. But this debarment in no way affects the cause of action already vested in him. The [1975] Act does not prohibit the withdrawal of the application for compensation. As soon as the application for compensation is withdrawn, the right to maintain an action <i>revives</i> and the workman can then proceed with his action for damages in the court. The workman\u2019s right to compensation under the [1975] Act lies <i>dormant</i> while he pursues his common law action but should he lose the action he may choose to ask the court, under s\u00a033(2) [now s\u00a033(3) of the Act] to assess the compensation under the [1975] Act. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the decision in <i>Ying Tai Plastic</i> is eminently sensible. A contrary decision would have seriously diminished the common law right of injured workmen to sue for damages. They might have applied to the Commissioner for compensation without legal advice or in ignorance of the fact that they may obtain higher damages at common law or that the limitation period for negligence claims is six years. However, it should be noted that the question before the court in <i>Ying Tai Plastic</i> was whether a workman who had applied for compensation under the 1975 Act could withdraw the claim and commence a common law action, and the Court of Appeal answered it in the affirmative. (Indeed, it was not even necessary for the court to have made a finding because it held, on the facts, that the workman had not made an application at all as he was not aware of the purpose of the application to which he had put his thumbprint.) It held that so long as there was an application before the Commissioner, the workman could not claim at common law. The court did not construe the words \u201chas applied\u201d in the subsection literally to the act of applying but purposively to an existing application. What was not in issue and which the court was not asked to determine was whether a claim held in abeyance (or suspended) came within s\u00a033(1) or s\u00a033(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act. We would now like to address this question.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>May a claim for compensation be suspended?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, Tay\u00a0JC in <i>Chua Ah Beng</i> held that a suspended claim was a current proceeding under s\u00a033(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act on the ground that this court had so decided in <i>Ying Tai Plastic</i> (see [25] of <i>Chua Ah Beng</i> where he pointed out that this court had referred to <i>the</i> <i>right to compensation</i> lying dormant and not <i>the filed claim</i>)<i>.</i> Tay\u00a0JC\u2019s approach is consistent with that of Prakash\u00a0J in <i>Rahenah</i> in relation to the question of whether the word \u201cmaintainable\u201d can refer to an action that is not current, <i>eg</i>, when it has been stayed. At [30] of <i>Rahenah</i>, she said:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The District Judge appeared to consider that the word \u2018maintainable\u2019 as used in s\u00a033(2)(<i>a</i>) meant actively prosecuting an action. This was not the interpretation given to that word by [F\u00a0A]\u00a0Chua\u00a0J in [<i>Ying Tai Plastic</i>]. The Court of Appeal equated \u2018maintainable\u2019 with \u2018bringing a common law action for damages\u2019. Chua\u00a0J accepted that the word \u2018maintainable\u2019 referred to the right to bring an action and not to the right to actively prosecute it. This accords with the definition of the term \u2018right of action\u2019 given by <i>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary</i> (6<sup>th</sup> Ed) which states that that term includes \u2018the legal right to maintain an action\u2019.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Notwithstanding these two rulings, <i>ie</i>: (a)\u00a0in <i>Rahenah</i>, if the workman has a claim before the Commissioner, he has no right to commence a common law action; and (b)\u00a0in <i>Chua Ah Beng</i>, a suspended claim is a current proceeding and thereby prevents the right to commence a common law action, it is arguable that a dormant right to compensation includes a dormant claim, <i>ie</i>, a suspended claim. Such a claim is not current. Similarly, a stayed action is not current.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In principle, there is no reason why one or the other (and it does not matter which is made first in time) may not be suspended or stayed so that the other may be proceeded with. As a matter of policy, there is no reason why a claim for compensation should not be held in abeyance and, if so held, why it should be treated as a \u201cconcurrent\u201d proceeding under s\u00a033(1) or s\u00a033(2)(<i>a</i>) since it would not result in double recovery of compensation and damages. It would also not prejudice the interests of the employer and the insurer as both would have had sufficient notice to investigate the claim or the action and to defend either accordingly, if the facts so warranted it. Such an approach avoids the interpretational problem in relation to the words \u201cfailure to make a claim\u201d in s\u00a011(4) of the Act (dealt with at [53]\u2013[54] below) and also gives better effect to the object of the Act in providing fault-free compensation to workmen injured or killed by accidents arising out of and in the course of their employment. Indeed, the Commissioner had previously adopted the practice of suspending claims under the Act to allow workmen to claim under the common law until the practice was held to have been wrong by Tay\u00a0JC. In this connection, reference may also be made to s\u00a033(3) which requires the court, if the workman so chooses, to assess the compensation payable to him if his action is dismissed in circumstances where the employer would have been liable to pay compensation under the Act. The effect of s\u00a033(3) is consistent with the rationale that there is nothing objectionable with concurrent proceedings provided they are disposed of sequentially to avoid double recovery of compensation and damages or <i>vice versa</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the appeal before us was not concerned with this issue, and therefore it is not necessary for us to deal with it. Nevertheless, it is necessary to point out that this court did not decide this issue in <i>Ying Tai Plastic</i>, contrary to the understanding of Prakash\u00a0J in <i>Rahenah</i> and that of Tay\u00a0JC in <i>Chua Ah Beng</i>. In the present case, Pang had made a claim under the Act and then withdrew it in order to sue his employer at common law. When he was later advised by his solicitors that his action might fail and that the employer\u2019s insurer had disclaimed liability, he decided to discontinue his action in order not to incur more legal costs and waste court time. He then applied to the Commissioner to assess his compensation claim. The Commissioner rejected it on the ground that it was made outside the limitation period under s\u00a011(4) and he had not shown that he had reasonable cause for failing to claim within that period. He applied to the High Court for judicial review, but his application was dismissed by the Judge on the ground that he could not show that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was irrational (or unreasonable according to the test laid down in <i>Associated Provincial Picture Houses</i>, <i>Limited v Wednesday Corporation</i> [1948] 1\u00a0KB\u00a0223).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Issue before this court</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issue argued before us was therefore a narrow one, given that the parties had agreed that s\u00a011(4) was applicable to Pang\u2019s case. The issue was whether Pang\u2019s failure to make a compensation claim within the limitation period was occasioned by a reasonable cause under s\u00a011(4) of the Act. As we have stated earlier, we decided this issue in favour of Pang and set aside the decision of the Judge. We will now explain why we held that Pang\u2019s reasons for his failure to make a claim within the limitation period amounted to reasonable cause.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Meaning of \u201creasonable cause\u201d in section\u00a011(4) of the Act</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a011(4) of the Act requires a worker who makes a claim under the Act outside the limitation period to show reasonable cause why he was late in making his claim. However, the Act does not define what a reasonable cause is. The first issue that has to be determined with respect to this point is whether a reasonable cause is a question of law or a question of fact. The Commissioner\u2019s position is that it is a question of fact. Pang\u2019s position is that it is a question of law. We shall consider this question later, but for the moment, we will only observe that whether it is one or the other, the Commissioner has given us the benefit of his views on what \u201creasonable cause\u201d is <i>not</i> rather than what it <i>is</i>. He decided that Pang\u2019s actions did not constitute reasonable cause, which is not helpful to this court in determining what would constitute reasonable cause.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the High Court, the Judge accepted the Commissioner\u2019s argument that Pang\u2019s failure to make his claim within the limitation period was not occasioned by reasonable cause, relying on the line of authorities beginning with <i>Lingley</i> ([11] <i>supra</i>) and a passage from Prof\u00a0Sheridan\u2019s article ([11] <i>supra</i>) at 343 reproduced below:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Deliberate election not to claim</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On principle, when a person knows he could claim and decides not to, there is not good cause for delay in claiming if he changes his mind. This has been laid down in cases of sickness benefit, and was the doctrine with regard to reasonable cause of the workmen\u2019s compensation cases.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Before us, counsel for the Commissioner (\u201cState Counsel\u201d) relied on the same argument and authorities and, in addition, referred to a series of post-<i>Lingley</i> cases which, he argued, supported the Judge\u2019s decision: <i>Atherton v Chorley Colliery Co, Ltd</i> (1926) 19\u00a0BWCC 314 (\u201c<i>Atherton</i>\u201d), <i>Patrick</i> <i>Devons v Alexander Anderson &amp; Sons</i> 1911\u00a0SC\u00a0181 (\u201c<i>Devons</i>\u201d), <i>Abel v Estler Brothers</i> (1919) 12\u00a0BWCC\u00a0184 (\u201c<i>Abel</i>\u201d) and <i>Drewett v Britannia Assurance Co, Ltd</i> (1927) 20\u00a0BWCC 434 (\u201c<i>Drewett</i>\u201d).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, State Counsel and the Judge have misunderstood the <i>Lingley</i>-line of cases. As Prof Sheridan\u2019s article made clear, he was discussing cases in which the workers had <i>deliberately elected</i> not to claim workmen\u2019s compensation, and not cases like the present where the worker had indeed made a compensation claim but ultimately opted for a better alternative which the Act allowed him to do. In the <i>Lingley</i>-line of cases, the workers had initially elected <i>not</i> to claim workmen\u2019s compensation for various reasons and had only decided to do so after the expiry of the limitation period and after they had failed to get what they had wanted from their respective employers. In those circumstances, the English courts held that the workmen had never wanted to claim workmen\u2019s compensation, and for that reason they were not entitled to make claims outside the limitation period as their conduct might have prejudiced the interests of the employers who were not put on notice that there could be claims for workmen\u2019s compensation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Lingley</i>, the applicant, a munitions worker, was injured on 21\u00a0August 1917 but she did not make a claim until February\u00a01920. Under the relevant workmen\u2019s compensation legislation, she was required to make a claim within six months from the date of the accident. Thus, in <i>Lingley</i>, the applicant was two years out of time. Her only reason for not making a claim was that she regarded her injury as not serious and she wanted to continue working. The Court of Appeal held that no reasonable cause had been shown. Scrutton\u00a0LJ dealt with the policy considerations of the limitation period for making a claim and said (at 672) that the court must not overlook \u201cthe interests of the employer, which require that the employer should have the chance of investigating the accident, and considering the point with the evidence upon it\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Devons</i> ([37] <i>supra</i>) and <i>Abel</i> ([37] <i>supra</i>), the workmen in both cases were offered workmen\u2019s compensation by their employers but they rejected it. Their claims for compensation were also made outside the limitation period. The saddest case was that of the workman in <i>Drewett</i> ([37] <i>supra</i>). He was injured in the course of employment but continued to work until he was summarily dismissed for misconduct. In the hope of getting reinstatement he threatened to sue his employers but made no claim for workmen\u2019s compensation until two days after the expiry of the limitation period. The Court of Appeal, following <i>Lingley</i>, upheld the County Court\u2019s finding that the workman had never intended to make a claim during the limitation period and therefore had not shown reasonable cause for the delay. It would therefore appear that up to the 1920s the English courts were focused on the question of whether the workman had deliberately elected not to make a timely claim for workmen\u2019s compensation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the <i>Lingley</i>-line of cases are clearly inapplicable to Pang\u2019s case in three respects. First, in the present case, Pang had not elected not to claim compensation under the Act. In fact, he made such a claim well within the limitation period, but had to withdraw it in order to sue his employer at common law. Second, both the employer and the insurer had been informed of the accident soon after it occurred, and therefore they had not been prejudiced by being deprived of the opportunity to investigate the accident to determine whether they were at risk under the Act. In fact, they were not prejudiced, as it has not been disputed that Pang\u2019s injuries were caused to him arising out of and in the course of his employment. It may be recalled that his employer, who was also working with Pang, died from the accident. Third, the question of prejudice to the insurer would not arise in the context of Singapore law since the Chief Inspector of Factories had a statutory duty to investigate all accidents in factories and he had done so in the present case. Therefore, the concerns that were material to the courts in the <i>Lingley</i>-line of cases were absent in the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>James</i> <i>Gillespie v Convoys, Limited</i> 1939 SC\u00a0568 (\u201c<i>Gillespie</i>\u201d) at 574, the Second Division of the Scottish Court of Session explained the rationale for the requirement that a claim under s\u00a014 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u00a01925 (c\u00a084) (UK) must be made within the limitation period as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Wherever a workman who has met with a serious injury is detained in hospital during the whole statutory period of claim and has failed to claim timeously, the Court will always be anxious to examine carefully and sympathetically all the circumstances that will support a plea of mistake or reasonable case, and such questions when they arise will never be measured in too nice scales. The Legislature by its enactment of the proviso to section\u00a014 clearly intended that workmen were not to be deprived of the benefits of compensation through their claims being out of time where the failure could be reasonably excused. On the other hand, the statutory requirement is not a mere formality. As was pointed out by Lord Atkinson in <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Goold &amp; Co</i> [[1910] 1\u00a0AC\u00a0409 at 413], \u201cthe main if not the only object of requiring the claim for compensation to be made within six months from the accident is to protect the employer from stale demands.\u201d The employer is entitled to know whether he is to be met with a claim or not. The Court, therefore, must always be careful not to admit as an excuse anything that is not a real excuse, for were it to do so it would destroy the value of the statutory provision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">More specifically, Scrutton\u00a0LJ held in <i>Atherton</i> ([37] <i>supra</i>) at 322 that the provision in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act 1925 was intended to allow the employer to:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 take steps to protect himself, one of the most obvious steps being seeing that evidence is obtained as to the nature of the accident or illness, and having the state of the man at that time ascertained by satisfactory medical evidence, and if notice of a claim in that sense is not given, the employer may obviously be prejudiced in his defence \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, all the safeguards contemplated by the Act for the protection of the interests of the employers and the insurers were satisfied and their liability to Pang for compensation under the Act had crystallised long before Pang decided to institute his common law action against his employer. As the court in <i>Gillespie</i> (at 574) said, the UK</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">legislature, by its enactment of the proviso to s\u00a014 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u00a01925, clearly intended that workmen were not to be deprived of the benefits of compensation through their claims being out of time where the failure could be reasonably excused.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>\u201cReasonable cause\u201d is a question of law</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What then is a reasonable cause? As we have stated earlier, the Commissioner has never explained what a reasonable cause is under s\u00a011(4) of the Act or why the reasons given by Pang were not sufficient to qualify as reasonable cause. State Counsel, in both his written and oral submissions, avoided this issue by arguing that it was a question of fact and not of law, and that the court should not disturb the Commissioner\u2019s finding of fact. He referred to a passage from the judgment of MacKinnon\u00a0LJ in <i>Harris v James Howden &amp; Co (Land), Ltd</i> [1939] 3\u00a0All\u00a0ER 34 (\u201c<i>Harris</i>\u201d) which reads as follows (at 38):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It seems to me that a question as to whether or not there has been a mistake or other reasonable cause is primarily a question of fact, and, in the normal case when it comes on appeal from a county court judge who has found, or who has not found, that there was a mistake or other reasonable cause, the function of the Court of Appeal is only to say whether or not there was evidence on which he could make that finding.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We did not accept this submission. In our view, the court must first determine the legislative meaning of the words \u201cother reasonable cause\u201d before it can determine whether the facts come within that meaning. The determination of that meaning is a question of law. In <i>Shotts Iron Company, Limited v Fordyce</i> [1930] AC\u00a0503 (\u201c<i>Shotts</i>\u201d), the House of Lords held that what circumstances amounted to a reasonable cause was a question of law and not a question of fact under the corresponding English legislation (see also <i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England</i> vol\u00a034 (Butterworth &amp; Co (Publisher), Ltd, 2nd\u00a0Ed, 1940) at para\u00a01208; W\u00a0Addington Willis &amp; R\u00a0Marven Everett, <i>Willis\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts</i> (Butterworth &amp; Co (Publishers), Ltd, 36th\u00a0Ed, 1944) at p\u00a0436). In <i>Shotts</i>, the question arose as to whether there was reasonable cause for the workman to make a late application for workmen\u2019s compensation. Lord Sankey\u00a0LC said (at 507\u2013508):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]t was first argued on behalf of the employers that an appeal was not competent because the question was one of fact, and there was evidence which justified the finding of the Sheriff-Substitute.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">With this contention I am unable to agree. As Lord Parmoor said in <i>King</i> v. <i>Port of London Authority</i> [[1920] AC\u00a01 at 31]: \u201cNo doubt the relevant facts should be found by the learned judge, and then it becomes a question of law whether these facts are such as to constitute a reasonable cause within the provision of the statute.\u201d That decision was followed by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Hillman v. London, Brighton and South Coast Ry. Co.</i> [[1920] 1\u00a0KB\u00a0284 at 288], where Warrington L.J. said: \u201cThe facts are sufficiently found by the judgment of the county court judge, and are not in dispute. It is now open to us, if we think that the county court judge has from those facts drawn the wrong conclusion of law, to reverse his decision.\u201d <i>In my view, the question whether the facts as found amount to reasonable cause is one of law.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Lord Macmillan was equally direct (at 514):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The question in the present case was not whether the facts found entitled the arbitrator to draw from them the conclusion which he formed, in the sense that there was evidence from which he could so conclude in fact, but whether on the facts found the arbitrator was right in law in his conclusion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the difference of opinion between the English judges, we prefer the opinion of the House of Lords in <i>Shotts.</i> If MacKinnon\u00a0LJ\u2019s view in <i>Harris</i> represents the law, we would be faced with a situation in which if the Commissioner decides that facts A, B and C do not constitute reasonable cause, then <i>cadit quaestio</i> (there is no room for further argument), since the court would be unable to disagree because that would go into the merits of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. This would mean that whatever the Commissioner decides, goes. In our view, this is particularly ironic and unfair, since in the present case the Commissioner himself is unable to articulate what a reasonable cause is. His legal position reflects an <i>ipse dixit</i> approach in the exercise of discretionary power by an administrative agency, an approach which no court that is prepared to uphold the rule of law will accept.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Were Pang\u2019s actions a reasonable cause under section\u00a011(4) of the Act?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the words \u201creasonable cause\u201d should be given an expansive meaning and one that gives effect to the objective of the Act in providing compensation to injured workers as a first or last resort. Although this expression is juxtaposed with two other reasonable causes, <i>viz</i>, mistake and being out of Singapore, thereby suggesting that a reasonable cause refers to a physical or mental ability to make a claim for compensation in a timely manner, it is our view that the concept of reasonable cause in s\u00a011(4) of the Act should be construed to cover a situation where the workman has exercised a lawful right given to him by the Act, <i>ie</i>, to pursue his common law remedy without having to forego his claim for compensation, provided his untimely claim does not prejudice the interests of the other parties, <i>viz</i>, the employer or the insurer. What amounts to a reasonable cause has to be determined on the facts of each case, on the principle of balancing the interests of the workman and those of the employer or the insurer. In <i>Harris</i>, the English Court of Appeal interpreted the identical words in the corresponding English Act to apply to a case where the workman could be said to be more blameworthy than Pang in the present case. In <i>Harris</i>, the widow of the deceased workman had commenced a common law action outside the corresponding limitation period for making a workmen\u2019s compensation claim, yet she sought to avail herself to workmen\u2019s compensation under the equivalent of our s\u00a033(3) of the Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, counsel for Pang argued, citing <i>Gillespie</i> ([42] <i>supra</i>), that reasonable cause is established where there are extraneous circumstances beyond the workman\u2019s control that prevent the workman from making a workmen\u2019s compensation claim. We agree with counsel\u2019s submission in that what he had posited would be a reasonable cause. However, we could not agree that it was applicable to Pang as there were no extraneous circumstances beyond Pang\u2019s control that had prevented him from making a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation. Indeed, he did make a claim but withdrew it to pursue a common law action. These decisions were within his control. So was his decision to discontinue the action and not to proceed with it such that he could request the court to assess the workmen\u2019s compensation payable to him should his action be dismissed. He could have incurred more legal costs and wasted some court time, but his decision not to do so was within his control. Therefore, <i>Gillespie</i> does not assist Pang\u2019s appeal. If the element of control was the principle informing the words \u201creasonable cause\u201d then Pang\u2019s actions would not be a reasonable cause.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, counsel for Pang also relied on <i>Harris</i> in support of his argument. In that case, the husband of the plaintiff had been killed in an accident due to the condition of the floor in a power station. As the case for a common law claim was strong, the plaintiff did not make a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation, but wanted to sue certain parties for damages. However, before she could commence the action, great difficulty was encountered as to which party was responsible for the condition of the floor. Ultimately at the trial, the court held that the plaintiff had sued the wrong party. She then requested the court to assess her workmen\u2019s compensation claim under s\u00a029(2) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act 1925 (corresponding to our s\u00a033(3) of the Act), but her request was denied by the trial judge because she had not instituted the action within the prescribed time.</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">On appeal, the English Court of Appeal held that the decision of the widow, on the advice of her solicitor, \u201cthat she had a much more profitable claim at common law against the employers or the persons otherwise responsible for the floor through which, owing to its defective condition, the man fell and was killed\u201d (see <i>Harris</i> at 36), although that advice turned out to be mistaken, was a reasonable cause for not making a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation within the applicable limitation period.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the decision of <i>Harris</i> is helpful to Pang\u2019s case. As we have stated earlier (at [47] above), the applicant in that case was more blameworthy than Pang in so far as she had failed to comply with the applicable limitation period in instituting her common law action. For this reason, Pang\u2019s case was <i>a fortiori.</i> In our view, the decision of Pang to seek a higher recovery of compensation for his injuries at common law is by itself a reasonable cause under s\u00a011(4) of the Act, especially when the Act itself specifically allows him to do so, <i>and</i> when his employer and the insurer had suffered no prejudice, and their liability under the Act had crystallised. Furthermore, Pang\u2019s decision to abandon his action for the reasons given by him was a factor in his favour and should not be construed as an election to abandon his claim for compensation under the Act. In our view, it was impossible to view the Commissioner\u2019s rejection of Pang\u2019s claim for compensation as anything but a grievous misapprehension of the object of the Act. His decision was not only inconsistent with the object of the Act, but it also had the effect of relieving the employer and the insurer from a liability which had already crystallised. In this respect, we recognise that State Counsel, in defending the Commissioner\u2019s position, was in an unenviable position of having to defend an indefensible case which was not of his making.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leaving aside these authorities, we were also of the view that there was another relevant factor in Pang\u2019s favour that the Commissioner should have taken into account in determining whether Pang had shown reasonable cause under s\u00a011(4) of the Act. That factor was his desire to save legal costs and judicial time in not having to pursue a futile claim to the end. In our view, Pang\u2019s actions were socially responsible and, at the same time, caused no prejudice to the insurer as its liability to Pang had crystallised long before the new claim was made. In our view, the Commissioner erred in law in rejecting Pang\u2019s new claim for compensation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Scope of section\u00a011(4) of the Act \u2013 meaning of \u201cfailure to make a claim\u201d</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a011(4) provides that the failure to make a claim within the limitation period is not a bar to making such a claim if the failure is occasioned by, <i>inter alia</i>, a reasonable cause. In the court below, it was assumed that Pang had failed to do so. In the course of hearing this appeal, we raised the question whether s\u00a011(4) was applicable to Pang\u2019s case as he had made a claim which he withdrew in order to sue at common law. It could be argued that Pang did not fail to make the Compensation Claim within the limitation period since he did make it within that period. The withdrawal of the Compensation Claim cannot affect the reality that he had made a claim although it was subsequently withdrawn. In our view, there is room for construing s\u00a011(4) purposively by determining its objective. The <i>Lingley</i>-line of cases show clearly that s\u00a011(4) is intended to apply to a case where the workman had no intention to make a claim under the Act and did not do so until after the expiry of the limitation period. In such cases, an employer might have acted on the basis that the workman did not wish to make such a claim and might have thereby acted in a way prejudicial to its interests. The case of <i>Harris</i> shows that even if a workman does not make a claim within the limitation period but has not demonstrated any intention not to make a claim (in that case, the workman sued at common law outside the limitation period for making a compensation claim), he may still make a claim under the English provision corresponding to s\u00a011(4) of the Act. <i>Harris</i> is also authority for the proposition that the workman\u2019s decision to pursue what he regards as a \u201cmore profitable\u201d claim at common law is a reasonable cause for not making a compensation claim under the Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the objective of the Act in securing for injured workmen compensation without fault, and the rationale of s\u00a011(4) that the interests of an employer should not be prejudiced by the delayed action of a workman in making a claim under the Act, a workman who has made a timely claim but who has withdrawn it should not be held to have failed to make a claim under s\u00a011(4). In our view, this is a more rational way to construe s\u00a011(4) than to apply it to an untimely claim made after a timely claim has been withdrawn in order to pursue a common law action. The ultimate conclusion is the same. Either s\u00a011(4) of the Act does not apply, or the workman has shown reasonable cause. Section\u00a011(4) should therefore be interpreted to apply only to the <i>Lingley</i>-line of cases where the workman had no intention to make a compensation claim until after the expiry of the limitation period for making such a claim. Whether s\u00a011(4) of the Act applies to a particular situation would depend on the intention of the workman and whether his omission has caused or is likely to cause prejudice to his employer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Second and third grounds of appeal not addressed</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the determination of the first ground of appeal also determined the fate of the appeal, it was not necessary for us to determine the remaining two grounds of appeal, <i>viz</i>: (a)\u00a0whether Pang had a legitimate expectation that his claim would be allowed by reason of Tan\u2019s case; and (b)\u00a0whether the Commissioner\u2019s failure to give any positive reasons for his decision made his decision irrational and constituted a breach of the rules of natural justice and fairness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the above reasons, we allowed the appeal with costs and granted leave to the appellant to proceed with his application for judicial review.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Observations on <i>ex parte</i> applications for judicial review</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should like to add by way of guidance to judges who hear <i>ex parte</i> applications for leave for judicial review that the purpose of requiring leave is to enable the court to sieve out frivolous applications.

There is no reason why an <i>ex parte</i> application such as Pang\u2019s could not have been heard <i>inter partes</i> and disposed of on the merits as a substantive application. As for this appeal, given our conclusions on the substantive issues in this case, we indicated to State Counsel that he should advise the Commissioner that Pang\u2019s claim for workmen\u2019s compensation should be processed immediately without the necessity of another court hearing, at which the Commissioner was bound to fail.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The patent was first\n\nregistered in the United Kingdom as No GB 2 289 500. It was subsequently registered in Singapore and\n\nthe certificate of registration was issued on 16 November 1998. The mailbox assembly was designed by\n\nthe second appellant, Tan Mui Teck (Mr Tan). He is therefore the proprietor of the patent, and\n\nthe first appellant, Bean Innovations Pte Ltd (Bean Innovations), in which Mr Tan is the\n\nmanaging director, is the exclusive licensee of the patent in Singapore. The mailbox assembly as\n\ndesigned by Mr Tan has a device of central locking system for individual mailboxes, which serves to\n\nprevent junk mails from being delivered into the individual mailboxes. For convenience, we shall\n\nrefer to Mr Tans patent as the appellants patent, and the device or invention designed by him\n\nas the appellants device or invention.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants device or invention has the following main\n\nfeatures. Each of the mail box in the assembly has a delivery flap, called the postmans trap\n\ndoor, through which the mails are delivered, and a collection door for collecting the mails. The\n\ntop edge of each postmans trap door is pivotally connected to a bar and the lower outer edge\n\nabuts against a portion of a stopper, called the trap door stopper. This assembly of mailboxes\n\nhas a device of a central locking system for individual mailboxes, and the device operates in this\n\nway. In the interior of the mailboxes, there is a matrix of orthogonal bars comprising: (i) a\n\nuniversal biasing bar at the top running along the width of the assembly; (ii) a pair of vertical\n\nsupporting bars, one on each side, connected to both ends of the biasing bar at the top; and (iii) a\n\nplurality of horizontal bars, called the anti-junk mail bars, which are positioned behind the\n\npostmans trap doors extending between the two vertical support bars and connected to them. Thus,\n\nall the bars within this matrix are connected. This matrix of bars is movable vertically. When the\n\nmatrix is lowered, the horizontal anti-junk mail bars block the postmans trap doors, thus\n\npreventing them from being opened, and when the matrix is raised the anti-junk mail bars in turn are\n\nraised, thus allowing the postmans trap doors to be opened and mails to be delivered into the\n\nmailboxes. This movement of the matrix is operated by a master lock located at the upper front panel\n\nof the mailbox assembly but just below the biasing bar so that when the lock is turned or unlocked,\n\nit raises the matrix of bars within the mailbox assembly, and when it is locked, it lowers the\n\nmatrix. Such device serves to prevent junk mails from being delivered into the individual mailboxes.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondents, Flexon Pte Ltd (Flexon), were\n\nincorporated in 1975, and have since been involved in the manufacture of fabricated metal products.\n\nThey have designed a mail box assembly, which also has a device of central locking system for\n\nindividual mailboxes, and they call it Master Door Letter Box with Aperture Central Locking.\n\nWe shall refer to this invention of Flexon as the Flexon device or invention.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Flexon invention has the following main features. It is\n\nan assembly of mailboxes and each mailbox has a delivery flap through which the mails are delivered,\n\nand a collection door immediately below the flap. The lower edge of the flap abuts against the upper\n\nedge of the collection door, which acts as a stopper for the flap. The mailbox central locking\n\nsystem operates in this way. In the interior of the mailboxes are the stopper screws at one side\n\nwhich are located immediately behind the flaps but do not extend across the flaps. They are screwed\n\nonto a vertical bar at the side The vertical side bar is connected to a lever at the top and this\n\nlever raises and lowers the side bar vertically. When the side bar is lowered, the stopper screws\n\nare in turn lowered and block the flaps, thus preventing them from being opened. When the side bar\n\nis raised, the stopper screws in turn are raised, thus allowing the flaps to be opened. The movement\n\nof the side bar vertically is operated by a master lock located at the upper front panel but slotted\n\ninto the lever inside. When the lock is in a locked position, it lowers the vertical bar which in\n\nturn lowers the stopper screws to a position just behind the flap thus preventing the flaps from\n\nbeing opened. When the master lock is turned and unlocked, the lever raises the side bar, which in\n\nturn raises the stopper screws, thus allowing the flaps to be opened and mails to be delivered. This\n\ndevice is also designed to prevent junk mails from being delivered into the mailboxes.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Admittedly, there is a demand for mailbox assemblies with a\n\ncentral locking system for individual mailboxes. Such mailboxes have postmans doors which are\n\nclosed and can be opened manually by using a central locking key when the mail is delivered. After\n\ndelivery, the mailboxes are centrally locked by a device which keep the postmans doors closed,\n\nthus preventing junk mails from being inserted into the postmans slots in the mailboxes.\n\nSuch mailboxes are now commonly seen in condominiums and Housing Development Board (HDB)\n\nhousing estates. The market for such a product appears to be huge.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In September 1999 or thereabouts, Mr Tan discovered that\n\nFlexon had supplied and installed their mailboxes with lockable delivery flaps in a couple of HDB\n\nhousing estates. Following such discovery, on 28 September 1999, Bean Innovations, through their\n\nsolicitors, sent a letter to Flexon, claiming that they were the exclusive licensees of the\n\nSingapore patent and that Flexon had infringed their patent, and demanding, inter alia, that Flexon\n\nimmediately cease to manufacture and supply such mailboxes which infringed their patent, and\n\nthreatening to take legal action against Flexon, should their demands be not complied with.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response, Flexon through their solicitors on 15 October\n\n1999 wrote to the solicitors for Bean Innovations, denying any infringement and demanding that the\n\nlatter retract and withdraw their allegations. There was a further exchange of correspondence\n\nbetween the two firms of solicitors. Following legal advice, Flexon instituted legal proceedings\n\nagainst Bean Innovations and Mr Tan (jointly referred to as the appellants) under s 77 of the\n\nPatents Act, seeking a declaration to the effect that the appellants threats of proceedings for\n\ninfringement were unjustifiable, an injunction against further threats, and damages. In their\n\nstatement of claim Flexon admitted to having made prototypes of, manufactured, supplied and sold\n\nmailboxes with lockable delivery flaps to a certain construction company and certain HDB housing\n\nestates, but they denied that their mailboxes infringed the patent. In the alternative, they pleaded\n\nthat they were not aware of the existence of the patent and had no reasonable grounds for supposing\n\nits existence, and invoked the defence under s 69(1) Patents Act. The appellants in their defence\n\ndisputed the validity of Flexons claim and pleaded that Flexon were not entitled to bring\n\nproceedings against the appellants on the ground that the alleged threats, if any, fell within the\n\nscope of s\u00a077(4) of the Patents Act. The appellants counter-claimed against Flexon damages for\n\ninfringement of the patent and an injunction.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The case was tried before Rubin J, and at the conclusion he\n\nheld that the threats made by the appellants were actionable under s 77(1) and (2) of the Patents\n\nAct, and that Flexon were the aggrieved party and were entitled to bring the action. He further held\n\nthat there was no infringement by Flexon of the patent, and in consequence he allowed the Flexons\n\nclaim and dismissed the appellants counterclaim. Against his decision, the appellants now appeal.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The appeal</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn to the first issue relating to the threats made by\n\nthe appellants through their solicitors. The relevant provision, which gives Flexon the right to\n\nbring this action, is s 77 of the Patents Act which, so far as material, provides as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(1) Where a person (whether or not the proprietor of, or entitled to any right\n\n  in a patent) by circulars, advertisements or otherwise threatens another person with proceedings\n\n  for any infringement of a patent, a person aggrieved by the threats (whether or not he is the\n\n  person to whom the threats are made) may, subject to subsection (4), bring proceedings in the\n\n  court against the person making the threats, claiming any relief mentioned in subsection (3).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(2) In any such proceedings, the respondent shall, if he proves that the\n\n  threats were so made and satisfies the court that he is a person aggrieved by them, be entitled to\n\n  the relief claimed unless:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(a) the appellant proves that the acts in respect of which proceedings were\n\n    threatened constitute or, if done, would constitute an infringement of a patent; and</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(b) the patent alleged to be infringed is not shown by the respondent to be\n\n    invalid in a relevant respect.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(3) The said relief is:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(a) a declaration to the effect that the threats are unjustifiable;</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(b) an injunction against the continuance of the threats; and</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(c) damages in respect of any loss which the respondent has sustained by the\n\n    threats.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(4) Proceedings may not be brought under this section for a threat to bring\n\n  proceedings for an infringement alleged to consist of making or importing a product for disposal\n\n  or of using a process.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It does not appear to us that there is any dispute that the\n\nappellants, or at least Bean Innovations, by their solicitors letters to Flexon threatened Flexon\n\nwith legal proceedings, and that these letters were a threat falling within s 77(1) of the Patents\n\nAct. During the course of proceedings, counsel for the appellants conceded that the threats of\n\ninfringement proceedings were made out. It is therefore unnecessary to dwell further on this issue.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What the appellants now contend is that the threats fell\n\nwithin the scope of s\u00a077(4) Patents Act on the ground that Flexon were, in fact, the makers of\n\nthe mailboxes, and the threats concerned the infringing acts of making for disposal of such\n\nproducts, and hence no action can be brought against the appellants under s\u00a077(1) Patents Act.\n\nWe are unable to accept this contention. Section 77(4) of the Patents Act only exempts threats\n\nrelating to making or importing a product for disposal, or to using a process, but does not apply to\n\nother acts of infringement, such as supplying, delivering, installing, selling and/or offering to\n\nsell a product, or otherwise disposing of it. The threats made by or on behalf of the appellants\n\nwere much more extensive. They were not confined only to the infringing acts described in s 77(4).\n\nThe alleged infringing acts referred to in the appellants threats were the following: making\n\nprototypes of, manufacturing, supplying, delivering, installing, selling and/or offering to sell\n\nmailboxes, which infringed the appellants patent. In our judgment, the defence afforded by s\n\n77(4) Patents Act cannot possibly apply to the threats made by or on behalf of the appellants.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Cavity Trays Ltd v RMC Panel Products </i>[1996] RPC\n\n361, the threat was in respect of acts of promotion, marketing and sale of the alleged infringing\n\narticle. The Court of Appeal held that the purpose of s 70(4) of the Patents Act of the United\n\nKingdom (to which our s 77(4) is similar) was to enable a person to warn off primary infringers\n\nwithout fear of being sued for threats. It prevents proceedings from being brought for threats\n\nalleged to consist of certain acts, namely, making or importing a product for disposal or using a\n\nprocess. Other threats of proceedings against manufacturers or importers, for example, threats of\n\nproceedings alleging disposal or use, do not fall within the subsection. The subsection defines the\n\nacts of alleged infringement that were excluded and not the types of persons who could be\n\nthreatened. It was therefore held that the threats relating to promotion, marketing and sale were\n\nnot excluded by s 70(4) of the Patents Act 1977.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Cavity Trays Ltd </i>was applied in <i>Brian v Ingledew </i>[1997] FSR 511. Jacob J said at 525:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">section 70(4) excluded from the generality of the prohibition of section 70(1),\n\n  threats in relation to certain types of infringement Although section 70(4) allowed a patentee\n\n  to issue threats in respect of use of a process, <i><font face=\"Times New Roman\">it did not permit\n\n  threats to be made in respect of offering a process for use which was a separately identified\n\n  category of infringement prescribed by the Patents Act. Thus, if the threat went beyond\n\n  threatening anyone for the use of the patented process, it was actionable.</font></i></p>\n\n  \n\n  <p align=\"justify\">[Emphasis is added]</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants further contend that s 77(4) of the Patents\n\nAct refers to making or importing a product for disposal and that, acts of supplying,\n\ndelivering, installing, selling and/or offer to sell are <i>ejusdem generis </i>and are logical\n\nadjuncts to the meaning of the word disposal. Such a contention is manifestly unsustainable.\n\nThe alleged infringing acts of Flexon cannot be construed as an adjunct to or <i>ejusdem generis </i>to\n\nmaking or importing for disposal. In any case, what the provision refers to is the making\n\n a product for disposal and not the making or disposal of a product. It is the act of\n\nmaking and not the act of disposal that is exempted by the subsection. Threats relating\n\nto the acts of sale and supply are not exempted.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our judgment, the defence under s 77(4) of the Patents\n\nAct is not available to the appellants. The threats contained in the letters were actionable under s\n\n77 Patents Act. It follows therefore that as a threat or threats had been made to Flexon and Flexon\n\nwere the aggrieved party, they were entitled to claim reliefs under s\u00a077(3) of the Patents Act,\n\nunless the appellants prove that the acts in respect of which the proceedings were threatened\n\nconstitute or, if done, would constitute an infringement of their patent. Hence, the issue now for\n\nconsideration is whether Flexon have infringed the appellants patent.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Infringement of patent</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this issue it is necessary to turn to the claims made in\n\nthe specifications of the patent. By these claims, the inventor sets out the essential features of\n\nhis invention for which the patent is granted, and these claims are intended to inform persons\n\nskilled in the art, namely, persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work,\n\nin which the invention is intended to be used. The setting out of the claims in the description or\n\nspecification of the patent is a statutory requirement. Under s 25 of the Patents Act, an applicant\n\nfor a patent is required to set out in the application, inter alia, a claim or claims which are to\n\ndefine the matter, for which protection is sought, in clear and concise terms supported by a\n\ndescription of his invention. In <i>Rodi &amp; Wienenberger A G v Henry Showell Ltd</i> [1969] RPC\n\n367 at p\u00a0380, Lord Morris of Both-y-Gest said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">It is a statutory requirement that every complete specification of a patent\n\n  must end with a claim or claims defining the scope of the invention claimed: the specification\n\n  must particularly describe the invention and the method by which it is to be performed and must\n\n  disclose the best method of performing the invention which is known to the applicant and for which\n\n  he is entitled to claim protection.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Thus, the claims as stated in the specification of the patent are the principal\n\ndeterminant of the scope of the monopoly for which protection is provided. In <i>Electric and\n\nMusical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd </i>(1939) 56 RPC 23 at 39, Lord Russell of Killowen said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <i>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The function of the claims is to define clearly and with precision the monopoly\n\n  claimed, so that others may know the exact boundaries of the area within which they will be\n\n  trespassers. Their primary object is to limit and not to extend the monopoly. What is not claimed\n\n  is disclaimed</p></i> It is not permissible, in my opinion, by reference to some language used in\n\n  the earlier part of the specification, to change a claim which by its own language is a claim for\n\n  one subject-matter into a claim for another and a different subject-matter, which is what you do\n\n  when you alter the boundaries of the forbidden territory. A patentee who describes an invention in\n\n  the body of a specification obtains no monopoly unless it is claimed in the claims. As Lord Cairns\n\n  said, there is no such thing as infringement of the equity of a patent <i><font face=\"Times New Roman\">I know of no canon or principle which will justify one in departing from\n\n  the unambiguous and grammatical meaning of a claim and narrowing or extending its scope by reading\n\n  into it words which are not in it; or will justify one in using stray phrases in the body of the\n\n  specification for the purpose of narrowing or widening the boundaries of the monopoly fixed by the\n\n  plain words of a claim.</font>\n\n  </i>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">[Emphasis added]</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">and at p 41 said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">A claim is a portion of the specification which fulfils a separate and distinct\n\n  function. It and it alone defines the monopoly; and the patentee is under a statutory obligation\n\n  to state in the claims clearly and distinctly what is the invention which he desires to protect.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, only Claim 1 of the claims in the specification\n\nof the appellants patent is in issue. This claim is stated as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <u>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Claim 1</p>\n\n  </u>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">In a multiple slot mailbox having a plurality of individual mailboxes, said\n\n  individual mailboxes each having at least one postmans trap door on at least one open panel,\n\n  said individual mailboxes each further having at least one users trap door on at least one open\n\n  panel, an apparatus for preventing the unauthorized access of the postmans trap doors, said\n\n  apparatus comprising:</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">a trap door stopper along the lower edge of each said postmans trap doors\n\n  for minimising the gap between the trap door stopper and the lower edge of the said postmans\n\n  trap door, said trap door stopper further having a stopper portion for wedging the lower and outer\n\n  edge of said trap door;</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">a matrix of orthogonal bars being placed in the interior of said mailbox and\n\n  directly behind the postmans trap door for wedging the lower and inner edge of said postmans\n\n  trap door against the inner surface of said stopper portion when said matrix of orthogonal bars is\n\n  lowered, said matrix of orthogonal bars having as its top member at least one universal biasing\n\n  bar running along the width of said multiple slot mailbox, said matrix of orthogonal bars further\n\n  having as its horizontal members a plurality of parallel anti-junks mail bars, said matrix of\n\n  orthogonal bars further having at its vertical members of plurality of parallel bars, said\n\n  vertical bars having its upper end coupled to said universal biasing bar; and</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">at least one master lock being disposed on the upper front panel and below said\n\n  universal biasing bar for raising and lowering said matrix of orthogonal bars.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">whereby the postmans trap doors can be released or closed simultaneously.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question that arises now is whether this claim has been\n\ninfringed by Flexon. This is essentially a question of construction of the Claim, comparing the\n\nfeatures of such Claim with those of the Flexon invention. In construing the Claim, the words and\n\nterms thereof must be given their reasonable and sensible meaning. In <i>Rodi Weinenebeger v Henry\n\nShowell</i> (supra), Lord Morris said at p 380:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">In the process of construing the claim (a process which must be independent of\n\n  any consideration of an alleged infringement) words must be given their reasonable and sensible\n\n  meaning as words in a document to be read by those versed in the subject and skilled in the prior\n\n  art. But if monopoly is to result it will only be for that which has been claimed. Protection will\n\n  not extend to that which might have been claimed but which, when definition was requisite, was not\n\n  claimed.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Similar pronouncements were made by Lord Upjohn in his speech in that case at\n\np\u00a0391:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">[T]he question is whether the relevant claim has been infringed. This is purely\n\n  a question of construction of the claim read as a matter of ordinary language, in the light of the\n\n  complete specification taken as a whole; but the claim must be construed as a document without\n\n  having in mind the alleged infringement. What is not claimed is disclaimed. The claim must be read\n\n  through the eyes of the notional addressee, the man who is going to carry out the invention\n\n  described.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, one must not adhere too strictly to the\n\nliteral wordings of the claim. A purposive construction is to be adopted. In the leading case of <i>Catnic\n\nComponents Ltd and Anor v Hill Smith Ltd </i>[1982] RPC 183, 242  243, Lord Diplock, who\n\ndelivered the main speech of the House with which all the other Law Lords concurred, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">My Lords, a patent specification is a unilateral statement by the patentee, in\n\n  words of his own choosing, addressed to those likely to have a practical interest in the subject\n\n  matter of his invention (i.e. \"skilled in the art\"), by which he informs them what he\n\n  claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent\n\n  grant him a monopoly. It is those novel features only that he claims to be essential that\n\n  constitute the so-called \"pith and marrow\" of the claim. A patent specification should\n\n  be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the\n\n  kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to\n\n  indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of\n\n  the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict\n\n  compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was intended by the\n\n  patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention so that <i>any</i> variant would fall\n\n  outside the monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the\n\n  intervention worked.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In that case, the plaintiffs were the registered proprietor of a patent for\n\ngalvanised steel lintels for use in the construction industry. Such lintels were used as support\n\nspanning the spaces above the window and door openings in cavity walls built of bricks and had at or\n\nnear the rear vertical support members. The defendants manufactured lintels which were similar to\n\nthose manufactured by the plaintiffs but with the rear support members inclined at six to eight\n\ndegrees. The plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, that the defendants had infringed their patent. At\n\nfirst instance, the trial judge found that defendants had infringed the patent, but the Court of\n\nAppeal reversed this finding. The plaintiffs therefore appealed to the House of Lords, which allowed\n\nthe appeal and held that the defendants had infringed the patent. In dealing with the essential\n\nfeatures of the claim, Lord Diplock said at p 244:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Put in a nutshell the question to be answered is: Would the specification make\n\n  it obvious to a builder familiar with ordinary building operations that the description of a\n\n  lintel in the form of a weight-bearing box girder of which the back plate was referred to as\n\n  \"extending vertically\" from one of the two horizontal plates to join the other, could <i>not</i>\n\n  have been intended to exclude lintels in which the back plate although not positioned at precisely\n\n  90 to both horizontal plates was close enough to 90 to make no material difference to the way\n\n  the lintel worked when used in building operations? No plausible reason has been advanced why any\n\n  rational patentee should want to place so narrow a limitation on his invention. On the contrary,\n\n  to do so would render his monopoly for practical purposes worthless, since any imitator could\n\n  avoid it and take all the benefit of the invention by the simple expedient of positioning the back\n\n  plate a degree or two from the exact vertical.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Essential features</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to identify the features of the invention\n\nthat are claimed in Claim 1. On the issue of infringement, the claims are the principal determinant,\n\nbut the description and other parts of the specification may assist in the construction of the\n\nclaims.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the main features of Claim 1 are the\n\nfollowing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(1) A multiple slot mailbox having a plurality of individual mailboxes, each\n\n  having one postmans trap door on an open panel and one users trap door, i.e. the collection\n\n  door, also on an open panel.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(ii) A trap door stopper is made along the lower edge of each of the postmans\n\n  trap doors for minimising the gap between the trap door stopper and the lower edge of the postmans\n\n  trap door. This trap door stopper has a stopper portion for wedging the lower and outer edge of\n\n  trap door.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(iii) A matrix of orthogonal bars in the interior of mailbox and directly\n\n  behind the postmans trap door for wedging the lower and inner edge of the postmans\n\n  trap door against the inner surface of the stopper portion, when the matrix of orthogonal bars is\n\n  lowered. This matrix of orthogonal bars has (i) as its top member, one universal biasing bar\n\n  spanning the width of the multiple slot mailbox, (ii) as its horizontal members, a plurality of\n\n  parallel anti-junk mail bars, and (iii) as its vertical members, a plurality of parallel bars,\n\n  these vertical bars at the upper end being coupled to the universal biasing bar.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(iv) There is one master lock on the upper front panel and below the universal\n\n  biasing bar, which is used for raising and lowering the matrix of orthogonal bars, whereby all the\n\n  postmans trap doors in the mailboxes can be released and closed simultaneously.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Of all these features, the most essential one is undoubtedly the presence of the\n\nmatrix of orthogonal bars described in item (iii) above. This matrix of orthogonal bars are used to\n\nrelease and close the postmans trap doors. As and when mail is delivered the master lock is\n\nunlocked, and this matrix of orthogonal bars is lifted with the result that the anti-junk mail bars\n\nare in turn lifted, thereby releasing the postmans trap doors. When the master lock is locked,\n\nthe matrix of orthogonal bars is moved down with the result that the anti-junk bars are moved down\n\nblocking the postmans trap doors from being opened, thereby preventing junk mails from being\n\ninserted through the postmans trap doors into the mailboxes.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Differences between the devices</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are clearly differences between the two inventions,\n\nand the principal differences are the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(1) The Flexon invention does not have a matrix of the orthogonal bars. Nor\n\n  does it use a horizontal locking bar to lock the postmans trap doors. It uses stopper screws,\n\n  which are screwed to a vertical bar at one side and do not extend across the entire width of the\n\n  postmans trap doors. This side bar is raised or lowered by a lever at the top. Compared to\n\n  this, the appellants device (as stated in Claim 1) has a matrix of orthogonal bars (described\n\n  above). This whole matrix of orthogonal bars is raised or lowered by the universal biasing bar\n\n  at the top, as the central locking system is locked or unlocked, as the case may be.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(2) The master lock in the appellants device (as stated in Claim 1) sits\n\n  below the universal biasing bar which, when lifted, moves the entire matrix of orthogonal\n\n  bars upwards or downwards, whereas the master lock in the Flexon device is slotted into a\n\n  horizontal bar-lever at the top and this bar-lever moves the grid upwards and downwards.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(3) The bar-lever at the top in the Flexon device moves the vertical side bars\n\n  up and down with each 90 degree turn of the key. This feature, however, is absent in the\n\n  appellants device.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In our opinion, Flexons assembly of mailboxes does not infringe Claim 1 of the\n\nappellants patent.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Wong Siew Hong, counsel for the appellants, submits that\n\nthe two devices perform the same or similar function, namely, that of preventing junk mails from\n\nbeing delivered into the mailboxes. In this regard, the appellants invention employs a master\n\nlocking mechanism to move up and down a grid, which is located just behind the mailbox doors with\n\nthe horizontal members of the grid, described as anti-junk mail bars, blocking the opening of\n\nthe postmans trap doors, when the devices are in a locked position, thereby preventing the\n\ninsertion of junk mails into the mailboxes. The Flexon device works in exactly the same manner. It\n\nemploys a master locking mechanism to move up and down a grid also mounted behind the mailbox doors\n\nbut with stopper screws, screwed onto the vertical bars at the side to form the horizontal members\n\nof the grid. These stopper screws prevent the inward swing of the postmans trap doors when the\n\ndevices are in a locked position, thereby preventing the insertion of junk mails into the\n\nmailboxes. These stopper screws in the Flexon device therefore perform the same function as the\n\nhorizontal bars, the anti-junk mail bars, in the appellants device.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel therefore relies on the similarity of function of\n\nthe two devices. Both, of course, were designed to prevent the insertion of junk mails into the\n\nmailboxes. The appellants invention uses the matrix of orthogonal bars to lock and unlock the\n\npostmans trap door, whereas the Flexon invention uses the stopper screws for the purpose. Both\n\nperform the same function. Relying on this, counsel argues that, although Claim 1 claims the\n\nessential features which are not found in the Flexon device, the absence of such features in the\n\nlatter is immaterial. The Flexon device is functionally the equivalent of the appellants device.\n\nAdopting a purposive construction, counsel submits that the Flexon device comes within the claims of\n\nClaim 1. We reject the approach.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In coming to this conclusion we find helpful the following\n\npassage of the speech of Lord Upjohn in <i>Rodi &amp; Wienenberger v Henry Showell Ltd</i> (supra)\n\nat p\u00a0391:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">[T]he essential integers having been ascertained, the infringing article must\n\n  be considered. To constitute infringement the article must take each and every one of the\n\n  essential integers of the claim. Non-essential integers may be omitted or replaced by mechanical\n\n  equivalents; there will still be infringement. I believe that this states the whole substance of\n\n  the \"pith and marrow\" theory of infringement. Furthermore, where the invention, as in\n\n  this case, resides in a new combination of known integers but also merely in a new arrangement and\n\n  interaction of ordinary working parts it is not sufficient to shew that the same result is\n\n  reached; the working parts must act on one another in the way claimed in the claim of this patent.\n\n  This is well illustrated by <i>Birmingham Sound Reproducers Ltd v Collaro Ltd</i> [1956] RPC 232\n\n  where Lord Evershed, MR delivering the judgment of the court said at page 245:</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Thus the essence of the invention resides wholly in the selection and\n\n  arrangement of the parts and the manner in which they interact when arranged in accordance with\n\n  the invention. It is therefore essential to the invention that it should consist of the particular\n\n  parts described in the claim arranged and acting upon each other in the way described in the\n\n  claim.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The question therefore appears to be whether the allegedly infringing apparatus\n\n  consists of substantially the same parts acting upon each other in substantially the same way as\n\n  the apparatus claimed as constituting the invention. It is not enough to find that the parts\n\n  comprised in the respondents apparatus individually or collectively perform substantially\n\n  similar functions to those performed individually or collectively by the parts comprised in the\n\n  apparatus claimed as the appellants invention, or that the respondents apparatus produces\n\n  the same result as the appellants apparatus. It must be shown that the respondents selection\n\n  and arrangement of parts is substantially the same as the appellants selection and arrangements\n\n  of parts, for it is in such selection and arrangement that the appellants invention\n\n  resides.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The essence of the approach as urged by counsel is to\n\nconstrue the claim wholly functionally. Clearly, this approach is wrong. To construe the claims in\n\nthe manner as urged by counsel would be tantamount to disregarding what is stated in the claims. The\n\nclear and unambiguous words employed in Claim 1 must be given their natural and ordinary meaning.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should add that the well-known principle that patent\n\nclaims are to be given a purposive construction does not mean that the court in construing a claim\n\nis entitled to disregard the clear and unambiguous words used to describe the essential features of\n\na claim. In <i>Societe Technique de Pulverisation STEP v Emson Europe Ltd </i>[1993] RPC 513 at 522,\n\nHoffmann LJ said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The well-known principle that patent claims are given a purposive construction <i>does\n\n  not mean</i> that an integer can be treated as struck out if it does not appear to make any\n\n  difference to the inventive concept. It may have some other purpose buried in the prior art and\n\n  even if this is not discernible, the patentee may have had some reason of his own for introducing\n\n  it .</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Laddie J in <i>Brugger v Medic-Aid Ltd </i>[1996] RPC 635 at 649, having referred\n\nto the preceding case quoted above, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The warning in <i>STEP v Emson</i> cited above has particular relevance here.\n\n  If a patentee has chosen to define the characterising part of his claim in narrow terms it is not\n\n  for the court to rewrite it in broader language simply because it thinks a wider form of wording\n\n  would have been easy to formulate.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Even adopting a purposive construction, one cannot write words into a claim that\n\nare not there or give a meaning to a term of a claim that is contrary to its language. A caution\n\nagainst blurring the purposive construction approach and the re-writing of a claim was given by\n\nGraham J in <i>Rotocrop International Ltd v Genbourne Ltd </i>[1982] FSR 241 at 255:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The question of equivalence and pith and marrow of course only arises in\n\n  doubtful cases. The authorities establish that if it is clear from the description and claims as a\n\n  whole that a particular feature is claimed as and must be regarded as essential to the invention,\n\n  then that is an end of the matter. Either the defendant has taken it or he has not and accordingly\n\n  he has infringed or not as the case may be.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Conclusion</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To succeed on the infringement of their patent, the\n\nappellants must show that all the essential integers of Claim 1 are present in the respondents\n\ninvention: <i>Rodi &amp; Weinberger AG v Showall (Henry) Ltd </i>[1969] RPC 367 at 391. This they\n\nhave failed to do. Accordingly, their claim failed and the appeal is dismissed with costs.

These proceedings were commenced in the wake of the decision of the Court of Appeal in two appeals, namely, CA 93 and 94/97, reported in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Fook Gee Finance Co Ltd v Liu Cho Chit and another action</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1998:2:121:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1998:2:121:\">  [1998] 2 SLR 121 </a>. The two appeals arose from the decision of the High Court in two suits, which were tried together. The first was Suit 4141/83, in which a Hong Kong company, Fook Gee Finance Co Ltd (`Fook Gee`) claimed against one Liu Cho Chit (`Liu`) (who is the respondent in the present appeals) the sum of US$642,451.04 as a loan. The claim was dismissed with costs by the High Court, and against this decision Fook Gee appealed in CA 93/97. The second was Suit 4149/84, in which the plaintiff was Liu`s wife, Lim Siam Soi (`Lim`), and she  sued four parties, namely, Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd (`Lee Tat`), Tan Geok Tee (`Tan`) (who had since died and was represented by his wife, Ching Mun Fong (`Ching`), the appellant in the present appeals), Lee Kai Investments Pte Ltd (`Lee Kai`) and Collin Tan (`Collin`), Tan`s daughter. Lim claimed, inter alia, as against all the defendants a declaration that Lee Tat held certain property known as Lot 1606 of Mukim 28 having an area of approximately five acres on trust for her and Collin in equal shares, or alternatively as against Lee Tat and Tan the sums of S$631,579.10 and S$1,800,000 representing the balance of the purchase price of her share in the property. The High Court allowed the alternative claim and gave judgment in favour of Lim in the sum of S$2,431,579.10, and against that decision, Lee Tat, Ching representing the estate of Tan, and Lee Kai appealed in CA 94/97.<br/><br/>The relevant facts which led to the two appeals were fully set out in the judgment of this court and were briefly these. In 1972, a company called Peng Ann Realty Pte Ltd (`Peng Ann`) purchased a large parcel of land situate at Kampong Chai Chee comprising lots 21-26, 4-4, 407, 120, 121, 122, 123 and 221 of Mukim 28, having an area of 186.7 acres. The company was specifically incorporated to purchase the land. Liu was at that time a shareholder and the managing director of the company. The purchase price was $1,090,000 and the agreement for sale and purchase was made on 18 July 1972 with completion scheduled to take place on 27 October 1972. Two days after the sale and purchase agreement was made, that is, on 20 July 1972, two of the lots, namely, lots 221 and 4-4, with a total area of about 5.8 acres, were gazetted by the Government for acquisition; some neighbouring and other lands were also included in the gazette notification. As a result, Liu and his co-directors were apprehensive that there might be a further acquisition by the Government of the other lots which Peng Ann had bought. They therefore decided to sell the remaining lots of the land.<br/><br/>In December 1972, Liu was introduced to Tan and following negotiations between them, a sale and purchase agreement was made on 23 January 1973 between Peng Ann and Lee Kai, then known as Collin Investment Pte Ltd, whereby Peng Ann agreed to sell to Lee Kai three of the lots, namely, lots 21-26, 407 and 123 (`the three lots`) having a total area of about 178 acres, at the price of $2,050,000 (`the main agreement`). Lee Kai was one of Tan`s family companies. Liu and Tan also orally agreed to develop jointly a portion of lot 21-26 containing an area of approximately 4.6 acres, zoned permanently residential (`the joint venture site`). The terms of their joint venture were subsequently reduced in writing and made in the names of Liu`s wife, Lim, and Tan`s daughter, Collin. These terms were embodied in four written agreements (collectively called `the joint venture agreements`), and we need to mention only three of them. The first was the sub-sale agreement whereby a part of lot 21-26, namely, the joint venture site, was sold by Lee Kai to Lim and Collin at the price of $50,000. The sub-sale agreement by special condition 1 provided that the purchasers on behalf of the vendor would apply for subdivision of lot 21-26 so as to delineate the site separately from the remainder of the lot, and that the costs and expenses in respect thereof would be borne by the purchasers. The sub-sale agreement was signed by Tan on behalf of Lee Kai, and by Tan and Liu on behalf of Collin and Lim respectively. The second was a pre-incorporation agreement, under which Lim  and Collin were to procure the incorporation of a company, Collden Realty Pte Ltd (`Collden`), with an authorised capital of $2m. Similarly, the pre-incorporation agreement was signed by Liu on behalf of his wife and Tan on behalf of his daughter. The third agreement was expressed to be made between Lim and Collin of the one part and Collden of the other, under which Lim and Collin were to convey the joint venture site to Collden in return for certain shares credited as fully paid to be allotted to Lim and Collin respectively. This agreement was signed only by Liu and Tan on behalf of Lim and Collin respectively; it was not signed by anyone representing Collden. All the four agreements were backdated to 23 January 1973, being the same date on which the main agreement was executed. It was not in dispute that neither Collin nor Lim was aware of the joint venture or the agreements signed on their behalf, and were only nominees for their father and husband respectively. The sale under the main agreement was completed on 14 March 1973 and all the three lots were conveyed on the written direction of Tan (presumably on behalf of Lee Kai) to Lee Tat, then known as Collin Development Pte Ltd, another company of Tan.<br/><br/>On 23 July 1976, the three lots conveyed to Lee Tat, except a portion of 4.2 acres, were acquired by the Government, and compensation in the sum of $2,500,000 was awarded. The unacquired land comprised: (a) a portion of 3.7 acres of the joint venture site; and (b) another portion of about 21,808 sq ft of land, also part of Lot 21-26, which was immediately adjoining the joint venture site and zoned rural. The entire area of the unacquired land was subsequently resurveyed and was described as resurvey Lot 1606 (`Lot 1606`). As it transpired, the joint venture did not materialise. Neither Liu nor Tan, and of course nor their respective nominees, took any step to implement the terms of the sub-sale agreement or any of the other joint venture agreements. Neither Lim nor Collin, and nor Liu and Tan on their behalf respectively, did anything to cause or procure the joint venture site to be conveyed to Lim and Collin pursuant to the sub-sale agreement; nor did they procure the incorporation of Collden as required by the pre-incorporation agreement. Thus, the original joint venture agreements were never performed; in fact the joint venture was abandoned by Liu and Tan.<br/><br/>It was only in 1980 that Liu`s and Tan`s interests in developing Lot 1606 revived. However, negotiations between them eventually failed, as they could not agree on the development plans. All this while, Liu claimed that he (or his wife) had a share or interest in Lot 1606. Liu claimed that in 1981 as a result of the differences of opinion between him and Tan he offered to sell his wife`s share in the land to Tan, and in April 1981 Tan invited him to Hong Kong, where after some negotiations Tan agreed to buy his wife`s share at the price of `$3.8m net of tax`. Tan further agreed to pay a sum of $2m by 24 April 1981 and the balance two months later. On 23 April 1981, in Hong Kong, Tan handed to Liu two cashier`s orders amounting to the sum of US$642,451.04 (equivalent to S$1,368,420.70 at the then exchange rate of approximately S$2.13 to US$1). Liu claimed that Tan agreed to buy Lim`s share in Lot 1606 for $3.8m and the sum of US$642,451.04 (or S$1,368,420.70) was a part payment of the purchase price. Liu further claimed that thereafter he called Tan asking for payment of the balance of the purchase price but Tan informed him that his (Tan`s) wife was not happy with the agreed price, as she felt that it was too high. Tan then asked Liu to sign a letter dated 28 April 1981 prepared by his general manager in Singapore, authorising the  payment by Lee Tat to Liu of the sum of US$293,555.99 by way of a cashier`s order. According to Liu, Tan would make this payment when his wife had cooled down, but this sum was never paid to Liu.<br/><br/>On 25 April 1983, Fook Gee instituted an action in Suit 4141/83 against Liu claiming the sum of US$642,451.04 alleged to have been lent to Liu. Liu admitted receiving this sum from Tan, but averred that it was a part payment of the purchase price of Lim`s share in Lot 1606 which Tan had agreed to purchase from her. In the alternative, if the sum was a loan it was void and unenforceable by virtue of the Money Lenders Ordinance of Hong Kong. Although the main defence to the claim was a sale, Liu did not take, or cause Lim to take, at that time, any action to recover the balance of the purchase price. It was only about one year thereafter that Lim took action by instituting Suit 4149/84 against Lee Tat, Tan, Lee Kai and Collin claiming, inter alia, the balance of the purchase price.<br/><br/>Both suits were tried together as the evidence and events which transpired were inextricably linked. The trial judge found that Lim had acquired an interest in Lot 1606 and that through Liu she had entered into an agreement to sell it to Lee Tat in 1981. She also found that the sum of US$642,451.04 (or S$1,368,420.70) paid to Liu in 1981 was a part payment of the purchase price and not a loan. She therefore ordered that Lee Tat pay the balance of the purchase price to Lim and gave judgment to Lim in the sum of S$2,431,579.10 representing the balance of the purchase price. Against this decision, Lee Tat, Ching representing the estate of Tan, and Lee Kai appealed to this court in CA 94/97. As for the claim by Fook Gee for the sum of US$642,451.04, the trial judge found that the sum came from a company called Komala Deccoff &amp; Co SA (`Komala Deccoff`), an import and export company owned by Tan and another person, and there was no evidence that this sum was a loan made by Fook Gee to Liu. She therefore dismissed Fook Gee`s claim in Suit 4141/83, and against this decision, Fook Gee appealed to this court in CA 93/97.<br/><br/>Both the appeals were heard together, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered on 6 February 1998. The trial judge`s decision in Suit 4149/84 was reversed by the Court of Appeal which held that, on the evidence, Lim had not established that she had acquired an interest in Lot 1606. Her claim therefore failed. As for Fook Gee`s appeal, the Court of Appeal, like the trial judge, could find no evidence to suggest that the two amounts paid to Liu in April 1981 were in fact a loan from Fook Gee. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.<br/><br/><strong><i> Proceedings below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>On 4 June 1998, the appellant as the executrix of Tan`s estate instituted proceedings in Suit 862/98 against Liu seeking to recover the sum of S$1,368,420.71, being the equivalent of US$642,541.04 at the time of payment. After the close of pleadings, Liu applied to strike out the statement of claim under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court on the ground that it is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court or alternatively on the ground that the claim is statute barred. Upon being served with the application, the appellant applied to amend the statement of claim. Both the applications were heard together before the assistant registrar, who  dismissed the appellant`s application to amend the statement of claim and allowed Liu`s application to strike out the statement of claim, and in consequence he dismissed the action. He held that the appellant`s claim was time barred by s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Ed) (`the Limitation Act`), and that the facts relied on did not give rise to a constructive trust or any other proprietary remedy in favour of the appellant. Against the decisions of the assistant registrar, the appellant appealed to a judge in chambers. As there were two applications which were dealt by the assistant registrar, two appeals were filed.<br/><br/>Before the learned judge the appellant proposed a further amendment, namely, the addition of [para ] 13A, which is to the effect that arising from the judgment of the Court of Appeal (delivered on 6 February 1998), the appellant became aware that Lim had no interest in Lot 1606 for which the payment of the sum of US$642,451.04 was made to Liu and that such payment was made for no consideration or was made under a mistake that Lim had an interest in Lot 1606, and that the retention of that sum by Liu gave rise to a constructive trust on the part of Liu. The learned judge agreed with the decision of the assistant registrar in striking out the statement of claim. He further held that the appellant was precluded from bringing the present proceedings by reason of the doctrine of res judicata in the wider sense as enunciated in the decision of the Privy Council in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank &amp; Anor</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1975]  AC 581</font>. In his view, Tan was a party in Suit 4149/84 and had chosen not to raise in that suit any of the causes of action now raised in these proceedings, and the appellant, his executrix, could not be permitted to raise them now; for her to do so would be an abuse of the court`s process. The learned judge dismissed both appeals.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The jurisdiction to strike out a statement of claim, whether under the Rules of Court or under the court`s inherent jurisdiction, is only exercised in a plain and obvious case. In general, the court`s approach to an application to strike out the statement of claim is to consider if the deficiency or defect therein, on the basis of which the application was made, could be cured by an amendment, and would prefer to allow an amendment rather than to take the drastic course of striking it out.

The failure to plead the want of best endeavours on the part of the first respondents is not necessarily fatal to the appellant at this stage of the proceedings since that deficiency can be made good by an amendment to the statement of claim before the trial.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Amendments of the statement of claim </i>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We turn first to the amendments of the statement of claim sought by the appellant. The proposed amendments consist of the insertion of, inter alia, the following paragraphs:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>11 In Suit 4141, the plaintiffs in that action Fook Gee Finance Co Ltd had commenced an action against the [respondent] herein, claiming for the return of the sum of US$642,451.04 being money lent by the plaintiffs therein to the [respondent], with interest thereon. The [respondent] while not disputing that he had received the said sum of US$642,451.04 from the late Mr Tan, however maintained in his defence to the claim, that he was acting on behalf of his wife, Madam Lim, when he entered into an agreement with the late Mr Tan for a consideration of S$3.8m net of tax, with the purchase price to be paid by instalments.  </p>\n        <p>12 It was further alleged by the [respondent] that consequent to the said agreement, the late Mr Tan had handed to him and he had received on his wife`s behalf, two Bangkok Bank drafts totalling the sum of US$642,451.04 in part payment of the purchase price on 23 April 1981. During the course of the trial, it became apparent for the first time that this said sum was never paid over to Madam Lim but had been retained by the [respondent].  </p>\n        <p>13 By its judgment dated 6 February 1998, the Court of Appeal in determining the appeals arising from the actions in CA 93 and 94/97 found, inter alia:  </p>\n        <p>(a) in respect of CA 94/97 (Suit 4149), that `Madam Lim has not been established that she has, or has acquired, an interest Lot 1606` [the property], set aside the judgment of the court below which had been given in her favour in Suit 4149 and dismissed her claim; and  </p>\n        <p>(b) in respect of CA 93/97 (Suit 4141), that `we can find no evidence to suggest that the two amounts paid to Liu [the respondent herein] in April 1981 were in fact a loan from Fook Gee. On the contrary, there was clear evidence to show that the two amounts came from a company of Tan [the late Mr Tan], Komala Decoff SA and not from Fook Gee`.  </p>\n        <p>13A As from the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 6 February 1998 the defendant became aware that Madam Lim`s attempt to establish the existence of an interest in the property for which the payment of US$642,451.04 had been made and accepted as part payment had failed. The payment had been made for no consideration or, alternatively, it was made under a mistake that Madam Lim had an interest in the property. The retention thereafter of that money, notwithstanding knowledge of that failure or mistake, gave rise to a constructive trust. The failure and refusal thereafter to refund what, as the [respondent] well knew had been paid for nothing or under a mistake, constituted a continuing breach of that constructive trust.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>There was no serious objection to these amendments and we could see no reasons why they should not be allowed. In particular, they did not introduce any cause of action, in respect of which the relevant period of limitation current at the date of the issue of the writ has expired. There was really no issue on the amendments proposed. The point in issue was whether, on the assumption that the amendments were allowed, the statement of claim (as amended) should be struck out on the ground that the claim was vexatious or frivolous or time-barred or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.<br/><br/>It is clear to us that the amendments were directed at overcoming the consequences of the claim being time-barred under s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act. On the basis of the amendments being allowed, the thrust of the argument made on behalf of the appellant was that s 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, and not s 6(1)(a), applies to the claim. Under s 29(1)(c), where an action is for relief from the consequence of a mistake, the period of limitation does not begin to run until  the mistake was discovered or could with reasonable diligence have been discovered. It was submitted that one of the appellant`s causes of action is for money paid under a mistake and falls within the ambit of this provision. The mistake arose in this way. Tan made the payment of US$642,451.04 to Liu in April 1981 under the mistaken assumption that respondent`s wife, Lim, had an interest in Lot 1606. That mistake was one relating to the ownership of property and was a mistake of law: see <strong><i> Bingham v Bingham </i></strong> 1 Ves Sen 126; 27 ER 934, and it was not `discovered` until the Court of Appeal held in CA 94/97 that Lim did not have an interest in Lot 1606, contrary to previous assumption on the part of Tan. It also followed from this that the consideration for which the sum of US$642,451.04 was paid to Liu only failed when that fact was established. The cause of action to recover the sum paid as money had and received or as money paid under a mistake of law therefore accrued only in February 1998, when the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment, and the claim is thus not time-barred.<br/><br/>Counsel for the appellant relied on the recent decision of the House of Lords in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1998] 4 All ER 513</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1998] 3 WLR 1095</font>, which abrogated the long-established rule that in general a party cannot recover money paid under a mistake of law. That case concerned an action by a bank to recover money paid to local authorities under certain swap agreements, which following the decision of the House of Lords in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1992] 2 AC 1</font> were held to be ultra vires and void. In <strong><i> Kleinwort Benson </i></strong>, it was held that the rule, under which money paid under a mistake of law is not recoverable in restitution should no longer be part of the law, and consequently money paid under a mistake, whether of fact or law, is recoverable. It was further held that money paid under a mistake of law is recoverable, even where the money has been paid under a settled understanding of the law, which is subsequently departed from by judicial decision or where the payment has been received by recipient under an honest belief of an entitlement to retain the money. Such discovery occurs only when the existing law is changed by a later decision of the court.<br/><br/>Reverting to the instant case, we are not concerned, at this interlocutory stage, to inquire whether in truth there was a mistake and whether such mistake was one of fact or law. The burden is on the payer to prove that he was mistaken and that his mistake had caused him to make the payment. We think that the several questions, such as whether Tan paid to Liu the sum of US$642,451.04 under a mistake, whether such mistake was one of fact or law, whether s 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act applies, and finally whether the mistake was discovered only when the judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered or could with reasonable diligence have been discovered earlier, and when it could have been so discovered, are clearly issues which can only be decided at the trial upon a full investigation of all the relevant facts and circumstances. For our purpose, we proceeded on the basis as pleaded in the amended statement of claim that the sum in question was paid to Liu under a mistake, that the mistake was one of law, that it was not discovered until the date the Court of Appeal handed down its decision in CA 94/97 and could not, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered earlier, and that the period of limitation began to run only from that date. On this basis, the appellant`s action for the recovery of the moneys is not time-barred. In  our opinion, this is not a plain and obvious case of an action being barred by Limitation Act, and the claim should not have been struck out at this stage. The entire issue: whether the action is time-barred would have to be determined at the trial.<br/><br/><strong><i> Constructive trust or other proprietary remedy </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before us it was argued on behalf of the appellant that she has a good arguable case that a constructive trust as a remedy is available to her as Tan`s executrix to recover the money from Liu. The money was paid to Liu under a mistake, and although the mere receipt of the money in ignorance of the mistake did not give rise to a trust in favour of Tan at that time, the retention of the money by Liu after the mistake was discovered (ie after the Court of Appeal had delivered its decision) gave rise to a constructive trust in favour of the appellant. Under s 22(1)(b) of the Limitation Act, no period of limitation applies to an action by a beneficiary under a trust to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof and converted to his use.<br/><br/>The authority primarily relied upon by the appellant in this regard is  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1981]  Ch 105</font>. There, the plaintiffs in July 1974 by mistake paid the defendants some o2m twice. Very soon after the payment, the defendants became aware of the mistake but did not take any step to refund the sum. In the following month, the defendants went into liquidation. In an action brought to recover the money, the plaintiffs sought to trace and recover in equity the sum they had paid under a mistake. Goulding J held that there was no conflict between New York law and English law and that both under New York law and English law the defendants were constructive trustees of the money which had been paid to them by mistake. In English law it was necessary to find that there was a fiduciary relationship between the payer and the recipient. Following  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Sinclair v Brougham</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1914]  AC 398</font>, the learned judge found that there was such a relationship. He said at p 119:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>A person who pays money to another under a factual mistake retains an equitable property in it and the conscience of that other is subjected to a fiduciary duty to respect his proprietary right. I am fortified in my opinion by the speech of Viscount Haldane LC in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Sinclair v Brougham</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1914]  AC 398</font>, 419, 420, who, unlike Lord Dunedin, was not suspected of heresy in <strong> Re Diplock</strong>. Lord Haldane (who spoke for Lord Atkinson as well as himself) includes money paid under mistake of fact among the cases where money could be followed at common law, and he proceeds, at p 421, to the auxiliary tracing remedy, available (as he said) wherever money was held to belong in equity to the plaintiff, without making any relevant exception.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Although in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington Borough Council</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1996]  AC 669</font>, the House of Lords departed from its decision in <strong><i> Sinclair v Brougham </i></strong>, and Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the course of his speech said that he did not accept the reasoning of Goulding J in <strong><i> Chase Manhattan </i></strong>, the House did not disapprove the conclusion arrived at by Goulding J. Lord Browne-Wilkinson said at p 715:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[<strong> Chase Manhattan</strong>] may well have been rightly decided. The defendant bank knew of the mistake made by the paying bank within two days of the receipt of the moneys ... The judge treated this fact as irrelevant ... but in my judgment it may well provide a  proper foundation for the decision. <strong> Although the mere receipt of the moneys, in ignorance of the mistake, gives rise to no trust, the retention of the moneys after the recipient bank learned of the mistake may well have given rise to a constructive trust: Snell`s Equity</strong> p 193; Pettit, <strong> Equity and Law of Trusts</strong> (7th Ed, 1993) p 168;  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Metall und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1990] 1 QB 391</font>, 473-474. [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the import of this part of Lord Browne-Wilkinson` speech was that in a situation where the money is paid under a mistake, a constructive trust may well arise at the point when the recipient learns of the mistake, because his conscience is affected by that knowledge. Applying that passage to the facts of the present case, it was submitted that as on and from 6 February 1998, when the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in CA 94/97, Liu`s conscience was affected by his knowledge of the mistake under which Tan paid him the moneys, and the moneys so paid were thus impressed with a trust in favour of Tan. Liu had been unjustly enriched and was under an obligation to restore the monies as a constructive trustee. The appellant further relied on the following part of the speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 716:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Although the resulting trust is an unsuitable basis for developing proprietary remedies, the remedial constructive trust, if introduced into English law, may provide a more satisfactory road forward. The court by way of remedy might impose a constructive trust on a defendant who knowingly retains property of which the plaintiff has been unjustly deprived. Since the remedy can be tailored to the circumstances of the particular case, innocent third parties would not be prejudiced and restitutionary defences, such as change of position, are capable of being given effect. However, whether English law should follow the United States and Canada by adopting the remedial constructive trust will have to be decided in some future case when the point is directly in issue.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Again, at this interlocutory stage, we would refrain from expressing any view whether in Singapore the court would, in appropriate circumstances, impose a constructive trust as a remedy. Quite apart from that, the success or otherwise of the appellant`s arguments on this issue must depend, to a large extent, on the circumstances in which the sum of US$642,451.04 was paid by Tan to Liu and whether such payment was made under a mistake and when the mistake was discovered or ought with reasonable diligence to have been discovered and the extent to which Liu`s conscience was affected by his knowledge of the mistake. These are questions which would have to be addressed and considered in the light of evidence adduced at the trial. At this stage, however, it cannot be said that the appellant`s claim for restitution on the ground of constructive trust is frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.<br/><br/><strong><i> Res judicata </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now turn to the last issue: whether the appellant was precluded by the doctrine of res judicata in the wider sense from pursuing this action against Liu. The learned judge in holding that res judicata in the wider sense applied relied on  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Yat Tung Investment v Dao Heng Bank</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1975]  AC 581</font>, a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong. In that case, plaintiff was the mortgagor of a certain property and defaulted in payment of the sum due to the bank. The bank in exercise of its rights as the mortgagee sold the property.  The plaintiff brought an action against the bank claiming that the property was conveyed to him as a trustee of the bank and accordingly the mortgage was a nullity. The bank counterclaimed for the loss suffered in the sale. The court dismissed the claim of the plaintiff and allowed the counterclaim. One month after the judgment, the plaintiff brought an action against the bank and the purchaser of the property claiming that the sale by the bank to the purchaser was fraudulent and in breach of duty. The bank and the purchaser took out an application to strike out the statement of claim on the ground that it was vexatious and frivolous and/or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. The judge at first instance struck out the claim as vexatious, frivolous and an abuse of the process of the court. The order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. On appeal to the Privy Council, the appeal was dismissed. Lord Kilbrandon delivering the judgment of the Board said at pp 589-591:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The second question depends on the application of a doctrine of estoppel, namely, res judicata. Their Lordships agree with the view expressed by McMullin J that the true doctrine in its narrower sense cannot be discerned in the present series of actions, since there has not been, in the decision in no 969, any formal repudiation of the pleas raised by the appellant in no 534. Nor was Choi Kee [the second respondent], a party to no 534, a party to no 969. But there is a wider sense in which the doctrine may be appealed to, so that it becomes an abuse of process to raise in subsequent proceedings matters which could and therefore should have been litigated in earlier proceedings. The locus classicus of that aspect of res judicata is the judgment of Wigram V-C in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Henderson v Henderson</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1843] 3 Hare 100</font>, 115, where the judge says:</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>`... where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The shutting out of a `subject of litigation` - a power which no court should exercise but after a scrupulous examination of all the circumstances - is limited to cases where reasonable diligence would have caused a matter to be earlier raised; moreover, although negligence, inadvertence or even accident will not suffice to excuse, nevertheless `special circumstances` are reserved in case justice should be found to require the non-application of the rule ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It should be borne in mind that abuse of the court`s process is the true basis for the operation of the extended doctrine of res judicata. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Greenhalgh v Mallard</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1947] 2 All ER 255</font>, 257, Somervell LJ said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... res judicata for this purpose is not confined to the issues which the court is actually asked to decide, but ... it covers issues or facts which are so clearly part of the subject matter of the litigation and so clearly could have been raised that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new proceeding to be started in respect of them.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>This passage of the judgment was quoted with approval by the Privy Council in <strong><i> Yat Tung </i></strong> (at p 540). It was expressly endorsed by the Privy Council in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Brisbane City Council v A-G for Queensland</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1979]  AC 419</font>, which was an appeal from the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland. In that case, the land in question was held by the City Council subject to certain terms and conditions. By a contract in writing, the Council agreed to sell it to a developer for use as shopping centres. The Attorney General of Queensland at the relation of one S brought an action against the Council and the developer seeking a declaration that the sale was ultra vires and void. That action failed and was dismissed. Subsequently, the Attorney General at the relation of S and another person B brought another action against the Council and the developer seeking a declaration that the land was held by the Council subject to a valid and enforceable trust for use as show ground, park and recreation purposes. One of the issues raised was whether the plaintiff was precluded from bringing the second action by the operation of res judicata in the wider sense. It was held by the Privy Council that abuse of process is the true basis for the doctrine of res judicata in the wider sense and that the bringing of the second action was not an abuse of process. Lord Wilberforce delivering the judgment of the Board said at p 425:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The second defence is one of `res judicata`. There has, of course, been no actual decision in litigation between these parties as to the issue involved in the present case, but the appellants invoke this defence in its wider sense, according to which a party may be shut out from raising in a subsequent action an issue which he could, and should, have raised in earlier proceedings. The classic statement of this doctrine is contained in the judgment of Wigram VC in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Henderson v Henderson</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1843] 3 Hare 100</font> and its existence has been reaffirmed by this Board in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hoystead v Commissioner of Taxation</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1926]  AC 155</font>. A recent application of it is to be found in the decision of the Board in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1975]  AC 581</font>. It was, in the judgment of the Board, there described in these words:</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>`... there is a wider sense in which the doctrine may be appealed to, so that it becomes an abuse of process to raise in subsequent proceedings matters which could and therefore should have been litigated in earlier proceedings.` (p 590)</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>This reference to `abuse of process` had previously been made in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Greenhalgh v Mallard</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1947] 2 All ER 255</font> per Somervell LJ and their Lordships endorse it. This is the true basis of the doctrine and it ought only to be applied when the facts are such as to amount to an abuse: otherwise there is a danger of a party being shut out from bringing forward a genuine subject of litigation.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>On this issue, it is helpful to refer to two very recent decisions. First, there is the case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>C (A Minor) v Hackney London Borough Council</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1996] 1 WLR 789</font>. There the plaintiff, a Down`s syndrome girl, lived in a council house of which her mother was the tenant. The plaintiff suffered from recurrent bouts of chest and upper respiratory infections which were caused or aggravated by the disrepair and dampness of the house. An action by the plaintiff`s mother against the council was disposed of by a consent order which specified the works necessary to put the house into repair and provided for the payment of damages. Subsequently, the plaintiff brought proceedings against the council by her stepfather as next friend claiming damages for negligence and breach of statutory duty. She obtained judgment in default of defence for damages to be assessed, but on the council`s application the judge at first instance set aside the judgment and struck out the  action as an abuse of process on the ground of res judicata. On appeal by the plaintiff, it was held, allowing the appeal, that although it was plainly in the public interest in the circumstances to have a single action in which the claims of all affected members of the household were included rather than a multiplicity of actions, the dependent child`s claim was not barred merely because her mother`s claim had been satisfied and the child`s claim could more conveniently have been litigated at the same time. The principle that an unlitigated monetary claim was barred if it could have been advanced and established in earlier proceedings could not be extended to bar claims by those who had not themselves been parties to the earlier proceedings. Simon Brown LJ, with whom Saville and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed, in the course of his judgment, said at p 794:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Turning, then, to  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1975]  AC 581</font>, it is plain from close consideration of the facts of that case that in reality it represents no significant departure whatever from the long established principle that only the parties and their successors are vulnerable to the doctrine of res judicata. Sir James Wigram V-C`s judgment in <strong> Henderson v Henderson</strong> 3 Hare 100, 115, applied in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1975]  AC 581</font>, 590 and there stated by Lord Kilbrandon to be the locus classicus of the res judicata doctrine in its wider sense, expressly referred to `the same parties`, and stated that the plea applies `to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which <strong> the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time</strong>`. [My emphasis.] <strong> Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</strong>, properly understood, held that the plaintiffs who were barred from bringing their later action were indeed able to be regarded as parties during the earlier, somewhat convoluted, course of the litigation; their new claim was in reality, if sound, a defence available in a previous action in which they had clearly been interested although not formally a party.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The general rule is conveniently found stated in the short headnote in <strong> Spencer and Spencer v Williams</strong> (1871) LR 2 P &amp; D 230:</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>`If parties litigate a question in a court of competent jurisdiction, and a final decision be given thereon, such parties or those claiming through them cannot afterwards reopen the same question in another court. This restriction does not extend to other persons whose interest is almost identical with that of one of the parties to the first suit if they do not actually claim through such party.`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>See too in this regard  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Black v Yates</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1992]  QB 526</font>.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I therefore reject entirely the submission that  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1975]  AC 581</font> justifies extending the  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Talbot v Berkshire County Council</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1994]  QB 290</font> principle - that an unlitigated monetary claim is barred if it could have been advanced and established in earlier proceedings (itself to my mind an extended application of the res judicata doctrine) - to those not themselves party to the earlier proceedings.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The second case is  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society v Seddon, Hancock &amp; Ors</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1999] 1 WLR 1482</font>. The facts were that Seddon took out a mortgage loan with a building society to fund an investment on the advice of Hancock, an accountant. The investment failed and Seddon claimed damages for negligence and/or an indemnity against Hancock, who admitted liability. But Seddon was unable to enforce the judgment against Hancock, because the latter had no money. The building society, which was then owed more than o180,000, commenced proceedings against Seddon who thereupon brought third party proceedings against Hancock and his partners, Walsh and Rhodes. The third party claim was  wider than the original claim against Hancock and included claims against all three of them for an indemnity, damages for failure to indemnify Seddon and/or negligence and/or misrepresentation. An application to strike out the third party claim as an abuse of process because of an inconsistency with the earlier claim against Hancock was allowed at first instance. However, the decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The main judgment of the court was delivered by Auld LJ with whom Ward and Nourse LJJ concurred. After referring to the well known dictum of Sir James Wigram V-C in <strong><i> Henderson </i></strong>, Auld LJ said at p 1490:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In my judgment, it is important to distinguish clearly between res judicata and abuse of process not qualifying as res judicata, a distinction delayed by the blurring of the two in the courts` subsequent application of the above dictum. The former, in its cause of action estoppel form, is an absolute bar to relitigation, and in its issue estoppel form also, save in `special cases` or `special circumstances:` ... The latter, which may arise where there is no cause of action or issue estoppel, is not subject to the same test, the task of the court being to draw the balance between the competing claims of one party to put his case before the court and of the other not to be unjustly hounded given the earlier history of the matter.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>He held that the <strong><i> Henderson </i></strong> rule is capable of being applied to cases where the parties to the proceedings are not the same as parties in the earlier proceedings. He said at p 1491:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In my view, it is now well established that the <strong> Henderson</strong> rule, as a species of the modern doctrine of abuse of process, is capable of application where the parties to the proceedings in which the issue is raised are different from those in earlier proceedings. Indeed, it is inherent in Sir James Wigram VC`s reasoning that, as a general rule, all persons who are to be sued should be sued at the same time and in the same proceedings where such a course is reasonably practicable, and whenever it is so and is not taken then, in an appropriate case the rule may be invoked so as to render the second action an abuse ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Equally, the rule may in an appropriate case apply to a plaintiff who could and should have pursued his claim in an earlier action against the same defendant ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>On this point, his view differed from that of Simon Brown LJ in <strong><i> Hackney London Borough Council </i></strong> (supra).<br/><br/>Auld LJ also held at p 1492:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In my judgment mere `re`-litigation, in circumstances not giving rise to cause of action or issue estoppel, does not necessarily give rise to abuse of process. Equally, the maintenance of a second claim which could have been part of an earlier one, or which conflicts with an earlier one, should not, per se, be regarded as an abuse of process. Rules of such rigidity would be to deny its very concept and purpose.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In his view, some `additional element` is required, such as a collateral attack on a previous decision, some dishonesty or successive actions amounting to unjust harassment. In a case of `re`-litigation falling short of res judicata (in the narrow sense), the onus should be on the person alleging abuse to establish what it is that makes the further litigation an abuse. The references in the <strong><i> Henderson </i></strong> rule and in various modern authorities to the need for a `special` case or circumstances to justify litigating a matter that should have been litigated on an earlier occasion are not an obstacle to his interpretation of the law relating to abuse of process as distinct from res judicata. To construe them as such would undermine the basis of  the court`s jurisdiction as it has developed, namely, to look for some element additional to mere `re`-litigation, to avoid restrictive rules and to be cautious before barring people from access to the courts. The learned Lord Justice then concluded thus at p 1498:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I can see no circumstance here to justify treating as an abuse of process Mr Seddon`s decision to sue and secure judgment against Mr Hancock on his admission of having given him an indemnity. He may well have taken the view, given that admission, that it would be pointless and wasteful to encumber that litigation with other parties and other claims. No doubt, the necessity only emerged later when his judgment against Mr Hancock proved unenforceable and he found himself on the receiving end of Bradford &amp; Bingley`s claim, requiring him to look to every possible means to protect himself.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the case at hand, Tan was a party in Suit 4149/84 initiated by Lim, and the appellant, his executrix, is now bound by the determination of this court in that action. However, Liu was not a party in that action, and purely with the parties as they were in that action as instituted by Lim, Tan could not have counterclaimed against Liu for the return of the moneys. It is true that Tan could have done so by joining Liu as a third party in that action; and that he did not do. But, in our opinion, his failure to do so did not make the present action an abuse of the process of the court. On this point, we find the case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Gleeson v J Wippell &amp; Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1977] 1 WLR 510</font> instructive.<br/><br/>In that case, the plaintiff was the owner of the copyright in a special type of collar-attached shirt for use by the clergy. In 1970, she commenced proceedings against D Ltd for infringement of the copyright in her drawings, the essence of her claim being that D Ltd had copied a shirt supplied to them by W Ltd, who had indirectly infringed the plaintiff`s copyright by copying a shirt manufactured for the plaintiff, which was itself a copy of the plaintiff`s drawings. W Ltd was not a party to the proceedings. The plaintiff failed in that action, the court holding that there was no infringement of the plaintiff`s copyright, and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. In 1975, the plaintiff issued a writ against W Ltd, alleging infringement of copyright in relation to the same shirt and claiming relief by way of declaration, injunction, damages and delivery up of infringing copies. On the application by W Ltd under O 18 r 19 and the inherent jurisdiction of the court to strike out the statement of claim on the ground that that since it had been held in the earlier action that W Ltd`s shirt did not infringe the plaintiff`s copyright, it was frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court for the plaintiff to seek to litigate all over again what had already been decided against her. In rejecting this argument, Megarry V-C held, inter alia, that the failure of the plaintiff to join the defendants W Ltd as a third party in the first action was not an abuse of process under the <strong><i> Yat Tung </i></strong> principle and she was therefore entitled to bring a second action against W Ltd. He said at pp 517-518:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I turn to the other way in which Mr Skone James [counsel for the defendants] put the matter. As this finally emerged, the contention centred on a combination of the <strong> Yat Tung</strong> case [1975] AC 581 and RSC O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) ... Mr Skone James contended that in the Denne proceedings [the first set of proceedings against D Ltd] it was so plain that Wippell was at the heart and core of the case that the plaintiff ought to have joined Wippell, and that as she failed to do so, she ought not now to be permitted to sue Wippell. On the <strong> Yat Tung</strong> case, the question was one not of failure to add a party, but of failure to advance a contention. There was a sufficient identity of parties in the two sets  of proceedings, but the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the statement of claim in the second action should be struck out as being an abuse of the process of the court because it was founded on a contention which ought to have been advanced in the first action, but which had not been. Mr Skone James ... urged that there was no great difference between adding contentions and adding parties.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It seems to me that the difference is very considerable ... [I]f Mr Skone James is right, the failure to join a possible defendant in the chain may mean that, whatever additional evidence or acquisition of riches subsequently emerges, that possible defendant cannot be sued in subsequent proceedings ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... I can well see the justice of refusing to permit a plaintiff who has failed to take an obvious point against the defendant to have a second bite at the cherry in order to take that point. What I cannot see is the justice of refusing to permit a plaintiff to sue a person at all because the plaintiff failed to join him as a defendant in other proceedings against another person. Such a failure may provide material for cross-examination in the second proceedings, and it may also sound in costs, especially if the second proceedings have the same result as the first; but the drastic step of striking out the proceedings is quite another matter.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>There is yet another reason for holding that the present action is not an abuse of the court`s process. One of the appellant`s claims is that the sum in question was paid to Liu under a mistake of law and the mistake was discovered only upon the Court of Appeal delivering its judgment. Now, this claim could not have been raised in Suit 4149/84, as at that time the mistake was not discovered and could not, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered - so the appellant claims. Upon discovery of the mistake, the appellant as the executrix of Tan is entitled to bring this action to recover the sum alleged to have been paid under a mistake.<br/><br/>In all the circumstances, for the reasons we have given, we are of the opinion that it is not an abuse of process of the court for the appellant to bring the present proceedings seeking to recover the sum paid to Liu.

We allowed the application, pending the filing of the respondent\u2019s reply. The respondent filed its reply on 11\u00a0August 2006.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The facts</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometime in 2001, the second appellant hired the respondent to market Tang dynasty artefacts (\u201cthe Tang Cargo\u201d) that had been salvaged from Indonesian waters. The respondent is a Singapore permanent resident, and was based in Singapore at the time. The second appellant orally appointed the respondent as a freelance marketing agent to find buyers in Singapore for the Tang Cargo. While the appellants contend that the respondent only marketed the Tang Cargo in Singapore, the respondent states that he marketed the Tang Cargo in various countries, including Singapore, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and the United States. The respondent was to be paid DM8,000 per month, in addition to any reimbursements for marketing expenses incurred, as well as a 4% commission of the sale price of the Tang Cargo.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The oral arrangement was terminated by the second appellant via a letter dated 28\u00a0August 2002, and was to take effect on 31\u00a0October 2002 (\u201cthe first termination letter\u201d). On 1\u00a0December 2002, the second appellant revived the agency agreement. This was supposed to continue until 28\u00a0February 2003, but the respondent continued to act as the second appellant\u2019s agent even after this date. On 30\u00a0June 2003, the second appellant executed a document prepared by the respondent\u2019s lawyer which stated that the second appellant and the respondent had agreed on freelance employment (\u201cthe Employment Agreement\u201d). The Employment Agreement contained a composite jurisdiction and choice of law clause, which read as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Parties agree on German law for this contract and the competence of the German courts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 6\u00a0October 2003, the second appellant transferred its business, rights, assets, contract and engagements to the first appellant. The first appellant asked the respondent to cease all marketing activities on 31\u00a0March 2004. The first appellant finally terminated the respondent\u2019s services via a termination letter (\u201cthe second termination letter\u201d) on 9\u00a0June 2004.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent commenced proceedings in Germany against the first appellant (\u201cthe German proceedings\u201d).

The parties attended court on 9\u00a0December 2004 and consent judgment was entered into for \u20ac151,700.10. To date, only partial payment has been made by the first appellant. On 28\u00a0April 2005, the German court heard the testimony of one witness, Mr\u00a0Matthias Draeger, who was a partner of the second appellant. Mr\u00a0Draeger is a German national residing in Germany.</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">On 22\u00a0December 2005, the German court released a decision for parties to reply to pleadings and to schedule an oral hearing. The German judge held, <i>inter alia</i>, that because the plaintiff in that case (the respondent in the present case) disputed the evidence in the affidavit of one Mr\u00a0Koh Seow Chuan (\u201cMr\u00a0Koh\u201d), who was the chief negotiator from the Singapore Tourism Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) for the Tang Cargo, Mr\u00a0Koh\u2019s presence was required so that he could be questioned. The oral hearing before the German court was scheduled for 16\u00a0February 2006; it is not clear from the evidence before us whether the hearing went ahead. There is also a motion to dismiss the claim filed by the defendant in that case (the first appellant in the present case) which is still pending.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants commenced the current action against the respondent in Singapore on 10\u00a0June 2005. The appellants have stated four causes of action (\u201cthe substantive actions\u201d), as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 conversion of 25 pieces of the Tang Cargo by the respondent;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 breach of the respondent\u2019s equitable duty of confidentiality towards the appellants;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 breach of the respondent\u2019s fiduciary duties as agent of the appellants; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 deceit arising from the respondent\u2019s misrepresentations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent filed his memorandum of appearance in the Singapore proceedings on 27\u00a0July 2005 and subsequently made the current application for a stay on 8\u00a0August 2005.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is at this point appropriate to summarise the facts surrounding the contentions made by the appellants in the substantive claims. According to the appellants, sometime in late 2002, the respondent represented to the second appellant that he had found an interested buyer for the Tang Cargo at a price of US$48m. This buyer was STB. On or about February 2003, in breach of his duties, the respondent falsely represented that STB was willing to purchase the Tang Cargo for US$48m. In fact, STB had not given such an indication. The second appellant relied on this to grant a two-month period of exclusivity to STB, during which time the second appellant agreed not to enter into commercial negotiations with any other party in respect of the Tang Cargo.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 21\u00a0October 2003, after the second appellant had transferred its rights and business over to the first appellant, STB informed the first appellant that it had never agreed to purchase the Tang Cargo and had never agreed to a purchase price of US$48m. The respondent continued to state that STB had made such an offer, and that the latter\u2019s denial was merely a negotiation tactic. The appellants allege that on or about 10\u00a0May 2004, the respondent met with STB representatives and disclosed to them that the first appellant needed to conclude a sale urgently and was likely to conduct a public auction. However, if STB offered US$32m for the Tang Cargo, the first appellant would consider selling it to STB. The respondent further told STB to act as if the meeting had never taken place. The first appellant was unaware of this meeting. In August 2004, the first appellant and STB negotiated for the sale and purchase of the Tang Cargo. STB would not agree to any price above US$32m. As the first appellant was running short of funds, it was compelled to agree to the sale.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The approach</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The governing principle in natural forum cases is that articulated in the seminal House of Lords decision of <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</i> <nobr>[1987] AC 460</nobr> (\u201c<i>Spiliada</i>\u201d), which has been approved by the Singapore Court of Appeal on many occasions as being part of our local law (see, for example, the Singapore Court of Appeal decisions of <i>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT\u00a0Airfast Services Indonesia</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 776</nobr> (\u201c<i>Brinkerhoff</i>\u201d) and <i>PT\u00a0Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Limited</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 49</nobr>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Brinkerhoff</i>, Chao Hick Tin\u00a0J (as he then was), delivering the judgment of the court, observed as follows (at 784, [35]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Lord\u00a0Goff, who delivered the judgment of the House [in the <i>Spiliada</i> case], to which the other four Law Lords agreed, restated the law (and in so restating, took into account the Scottish authorities as well) which is summarized in the third cumulative supplement to <em>Dicey &amp; Morris on Conflict of Laws</em> (11th\u00a0Ed) at para[s]\u00a0393\u2013395 as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of forum non conveniens where the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, ie in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interest of all the parties and the ends of justice;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the legal burden of proof is on the defendant, but the evidential burden will rest on the party who asserts the existence of a relevant factor;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the burden is on the defendant to show both that England is not the natural or appropriate forum, and also that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the English forum;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the court will look to see what factors there are which point to the direction of another forum, as being the forum with which the action has the most real and substantial connection, eg factors affecting convenience or expense (such as availability of witnesses), the law governing the transaction, and the places where the parties reside or carry on business;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if at that stage the court concludes that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate it will ordinarily refuse a stay;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if there is another forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate the court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should not be granted, and, in this inquiry the court will consider all the circumstances of the case. But the mere fact that the plaintiff has a legitimate personal or juridical advantage in proceeding in England is not decisive; regard must be had to the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a similar vein, in the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <i>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 97</nobr>, L\u00a0P\u00a0Thean\u00a0JA, delivering the judgment of the court, summarised the <i>Spiliada</i> test as follows (at 103, [20]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A stay will only be granted on the ground of forum non conveniens, where the court is satisfied that there is some other available and appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden of proof rests on the defendant, and the burden is not just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum but to establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the Singapore forum. The natural forum is that with which the action has the most real and substantial connection, and the court will consider what factors there are which point in that direction. If the court concludes at that stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, however, the court concludes at that stage that there is some other available forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. The court in this respect will consider all the circumstances of the case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Under <i>Spiliada</i>, the first issue that must be determined is whether, <i>prima facie</i>, there is some other available forum which is more appropriate for the case to be tried (\u201cStage One\u201d). At this stage, the legal burden is on the defendant. If the court concludes that there is a more appropriate forum, the court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nonetheless not be granted (\u201cStage Two\u201d).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under Stage One, we considered the following factors in order to determine if Singapore is the appropriate forum for the present proceedings:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 general connecting factors;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the jurisdiction in which the tort occurred;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 choice of law, <i>ie</i>, whether the choice of law clause in the contract was exclusive, and if not, which law should be applied to the claims in tort and equity; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the effect of the concurrent proceedings in Germany.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Before undertaking the consideration of these factors, we pause to note that the process is not a mechanical one. As V\u00a0K\u00a0Rajah\u00a0J aptly put it in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Peters Roger May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</i> <nobr>[2006] 2 SLR 381</nobr> at [20]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A court has to take into account an entire multitude of factors in balancing the competing interests. The weightage accorded to a particular factor varies in different cases and the ultimate appraisal ought to reflect the exigencies dictated by the factual matrix. Copious citations of precedents and <i>dicta</i> are usually of little assistance and may in reality serve to cloud rather than elucidate the applicable principles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Stage One</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>General connecting factors</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants contend that this court should have regard to the fact that the respondent was employed in Singapore and that his work and assets are in Singapore. Furthermore, the constituent elements of the alleged tortious acts, such as the misrepresentations made and the acts of conversion, were committed in Singapore, as were the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, according to the appellants, the main dispute centres on issues of fact. Two key issues of fact have to be dealt with \u2013 first, whether there had been a secret meeting between the respondent and STB and second, whether the respondent revealed to STB that the first appellant was willing to sell the Tang Cargo for US$32m. The evidence pertaining to these issues is in Singapore. For example, witnesses from the STB are located in Singapore. With the availability of tele-conferencing, consideration of where the witnesses reside should focus on the compellability of third party witnesses. The respondent has not produced evidence that these witnesses can be compelled to testify in a German court. In <i>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 253</nobr> (\u201c<i>Oriental Insurance</i>\u201d), the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court\u2019s decision regarding a similar stay application on the grounds that the High Court judge had not placed enough weight on the location of the witnesses. Indeed, the importance of witnesses personally testifying was recognised by the German judge in his judgment, released on 22\u00a0December 2005, where the judge stated that Mr\u00a0Koh was required to personally testify. This was despite the fact that Mr\u00a0Koh had already filed an affidavit in the German courts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The crux of the respondent\u2019s arguments, on the other hand, was that the appellants had not proved that the third party witnesses were not willing to co-operate by travelling to Germany. Further, even if witnesses from Singapore could not travel to Germany, evidence could be taken via video-conferencing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the importance of the location and the compellability of the witnesses depends on whether the main disputes revolve around questions of fact. If they do and, for example, the judge\u2019s assessment of a witness\u2019s credibility is crucial, then the location of the witnesses takes on greater significance because there would be savings of time and resources if the trial is held in the forum in which the witnesses reside and where they are <i>clearly</i></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">compellable to testify. Such an approach is supported by the decision in <i>Oriental Insurance</i></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">([17] <i>supra</i>), where this court held that the location of the witnesses was \u201ccritical\u201d as the dispute involved questions of fact.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The significance of questions of fact in the proceedings commenced in Singapore, in turn, depends on the nature of the causes of action pleaded by the appellants. Beginning first with the claim in conversion, the requisite elements were discussed in <i>Faith Maritime Co Ltd v Feoso (Singapore) Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2002] 4 SLR 716</nobr> (at [114]), as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As for conversion, <i>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</i> (18th\u00a0Ed, 2000) states at para\u00a014-03 that, \u2018The essence of conversion lies in the unlawful appropriation of another\u2019s chattel, whether for the defendant\u2019s own benefit or that of a third party\u2019. Paragraph\u00a014-25 states that, \u2018Mere unpermitted possession \u2026 is not a conversion \u2026 But there will be conversion if there is some detention consciously adverse to the rights of the owner, such as assertion of a lien that does not exist\u2019. Naturally, the possession or retention must be wrongful before there can be conversion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The elements of the tort of deceit were summarised by the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <i>Kea Holdings Pte Ltd v Gan Boon Hock</i> <nobr>[2000] 3 SLR 129</nobr>, as follows (at [37]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The tort of deceit consists of the wilful making of a false statement with the intent that the plaintiff shall act in reliance upon it and with the result that he does so act and suffers damage in consequence. This damage must be proved by the plaintiff; <i>Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal</i> <nobr>[1979] QB 333.</nobr></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the equitable duty of confidentiality owed by the respondent to his former employers, the general propositions of law were set out in the House of Lords decision of <i>Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 AC 222</nobr>, as follows (at 235):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Whether founded on contract or equity, the duty to preserve confidentiality is unqualified. It is a duty to keep the information confidential, not merely to take all reasonable steps to do so. Moreover, it is not merely a duty not to communicate the information to a third party. It is a duty not to misuse it, that is to say, without the consent of the former client to make any use of it or to cause any use to be made of it by others otherwise than for his benefit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having set out the relevant elements of each cause of action, we are of the view that each cause of action is at least to some degree dependent upon a determination of the respondent\u2019s precise actions and the events that occurred between the respondent and STB. These factual issues are likely to be in contention between the appellants and the respondent, and it is likely that there will be a considerable reliance on witness testimony so as to establish the version of events posited by each party. It follows from this that the location of the witnesses from STB, who are in Singapore, is a significant factor in favour of Singapore being the more appropriate forum. In particular, the action in deceit and breach of confidentiality would require evidence from the parties that the respondent allegedly made the false statements to. This would include Mr\u00a0Koh and one Mrs\u00a0Pamelia Lee (\u201cMrs\u00a0Lee\u201d), a senior director of STB, both of whom are based in Singapore. Given the likelihood of the appellants\u2019 claims raising a significant number of disputed factual issues, the location of witnesses should be attributed significant weight when assessing the appropriateness of Singapore as a forum for the dispute. It is trite law that a court, when engaging in the enquiry under Stage One, can and should attribute <i>differing</i> weight to each connecting factor depending on the nature of the particular dispute. This was recognised in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Andre Ravindran S\u00a0Arul v Tunku Ibrahim Ismail bin Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj</i> <nobr>[2001] SGHC 209</nobr>, where Choo Han Teck\u00a0JC (as he then was) held (at [8]) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The determination of the appropriate forum is not an exercise carried out merely by adding the sum total of all the relevant connecting factors. The court has to apportion a value to each factor and consider its place in the overall picture.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The importance of the witnesses from STB was, in fact, implicitly acknowledged by the Judge, who noted (at [28] of the GD) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As regards the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of breach of equitable and fiduciary duties and deceit, the plaintiffs asserted, <i>inter alia</i>, that [the respondent] had withheld information from his principal and had also disclosed price-sensitive information to the Singapore Tourism Board (\u201cSTB\u201d), which was the eventual buyer of the Tang cargo.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately, however, the Judge found that the location of the witnesses was not an important factor. The Judge stated (at [57] of the GD):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As regards the point that witnesses like Mr\u00a0Koh and Mrs\u00a0Lee are not compellable to attend in Germany or would also have to fly to Germany, I noted that the German court had already sought the attendance of Mr\u00a0Koh with regard to [the respondent\u2019s] claims. If he chooses not to fly there, it does not mean all is lost for the plaintiffs because there should be avenues for his evidence to be taken in Singapore. Mr\u00a0Bull did not suggest that such avenues are absent and I reiterate that Rickshaw itself had envisaged that allegations of [the respondent\u2019s] misconduct be heard by a German court, although this was in the context of their defence to [the respondent\u2019s] claims.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, we disagree with the Judge, as we find that the location of the witnesses is an important factor to be considered, and the fact that key witnesses are located in Singapore is a factor that points towards Singapore being the most natural forum to hear the substantive disputes. The assessment of the respective witnesses\u2019 credibility is also crucial \u2013 especially in so far as the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit is concerned. Indeed, in so far as the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of confidence are concerned, the principal witnesses (as we have already noted at [23] above) are located in Singapore. It is significant, in our view, that they are <i>clearly</i></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">compellable to testify in the Singapore proceedings, whereas this is not the case in so far as the German proceedings are concerned.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The location and compellability of the relevant witnesses were also key issues in dispute in the affidavit of Narayan, a director of the first appellant, that was admitted as fresh evidence, and in the respondent\u2019s skeletal submissions in reply to the fresh evidence adduced. Annexed to Narayan\u2019s affidavit were the submissions of the respondent\u2019s German counsel to the German court (\u201cthe German submissions\u201d).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the appellants, the German submissions revealed that the respondent had taken the position before the German court that the court should hear key witnesses such as Mr\u00a0Koh, Mrs\u00a0Lee and one Ms\u00a0Tania Wolff in person. This would give these witnesses the opportunity to prove their credibility. The appellants used this contradiction to cast doubts on the respondent\u2019s credibility and, more importantly, to show that even the respondent had acknowledged the importance of the physical presence of the key witnesses in court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In reply, the respondent pointed out, firstly, that the first appellant had requested that the German court dismiss the respondent\u2019s claim based on the briefs filed and the evidence that was already before the German court. The first appellant was therefore acknowledging that it was unnecessary for the witnesses to give evidence for the disposal of the proceedings. Secondly, under the German Code of Procedure, evidence could be taken from witnesses residing abroad either by way of written statements or before a German consul. Thirdly, there was no suggestion that any of the first appellant\u2019s witnesses were unco-operative or unwilling to travel to Germany. Fourthly, documentary evidence from the witnesses residing in Singapore could easily be produced in Germany.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the fresh evidence and attendant reply submissions did not significantly add to the evidence that was already before this court. However, it did reveal that the German court was of the similar view that the assessment of the credibility of the witnesses was important, and that their physical presence in the court hearing the matter was therefore desirable. We do not make too much of the fact that the first appellant had tried to dispose of the respondent\u2019s claim in Germany based on the evidence that was <i>already</i> before the German court. This could have been the result of a legal strategy that was taken precisely because the first appellant\u2019s German counsel realised that there could be difficulty in compelling the key witnesses to attend court proceedings in Germany. In any event, this evidence confirmed our view that the location and the compellability of the witnesses were important to the effective adjudication of the substantive actions between the appellants and the respondent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning next to the jurisdictional connections of the parties involved, we note that the first appellant was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The first appellant has two directors \u2013 Narayan and one Tilman Walterfang (\u201cWalterfang\u201d), a German national who is resident in New Zealand. The first appellant uses its related Singapore registered company, Seabed Explorations Pte Ltd, as a vehicle for its Singapore operations. The second appellant is a German partnership. Walterfang is one of the partners. The other partner, Draeger, is a German national who resides in Germany. However, the second appellant has transferred all of its assets to the first appellant and is only joined as a party to ensure that all the parties are before the court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent is a German citizen who currently resides in Germany. He is a permanent resident of Singapore and he was resident in Singapore at the time the alleged tortious acts and equitable breaches took place. The respondent has a bank account with the Development Bank of Singapore. Further, it is significant that the second appellant had initially hired the respondent as its agent because the respondent had represented that he had connections in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the German submissions, which were adduced as fresh evidence before this court, stated (at p\u00a08) as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[The respondent] was born in Japan and grew up in Japan and Singapore. To date he has spent a total of [approximately] 22 years of his life in Singapore where he is still resident today. ...</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[The respondent\u2019s] family had good business relations in Eastern and South-East Asia, particularly in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the respondent\u2019s reply skeletal submissions on further evidence, he only sought to clarify that he is now residing in Germany. The rest of the statement quoted above remains undisputed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In April 2003, the first appellant hired a Singapore-registered company, Davka Pte Ltd (\u201cDavka\u201d), to assist in the respondent\u2019s negotiations with STB. Davka was hired at the respondent\u2019s request. Although Davka is not a party to the proceedings, the fact that it is located and operates in Singapore further cements the notion that the respondent had contacts in, and ties to, Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, having considered the circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the above connecting factors point towards Singapore as the appropriate forum to hear the substantive actions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Whether the natural and most appropriate forum is that in which the tort occurred</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the trial below, the appellants relied on the case of <i>Cordoba Shipping Co Ltd v National State Bank, Elizabeth, New Jersey (The Albaforth)</i> [1984] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 91 (\u201c<i>Albaforth</i>\u201d), which states that the place where a tort occurred is <i>prima facie</i> the natural forum for determining the claim. According to the appellants, the <i>Albaforth</i> principle illustrates the application of the more general <i>Spiliada</i> principles to a particular fact situation (here, where a tort has occurred within the jurisdiction). This principle was accepted by the House of Lords in <i>Berezovsky v Michaels</i> <nobr>[2000] 1 WLR 1004</nobr> (\u201c<i>Berezovsky</i>\u201d) as well as by the English High Court in <i>Caltex Singapore Pte Ltd v BP Shipping Ltd</i> [1996] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 286 and <i>The Xin Yang and An Kang Jiang</i> [1996] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 217 (\u201c<i>The Xin Yang</i>\u201d), and has been applied locally by the Singapore High Court in the case of <i>Evergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2004] 2 SLR 457.</nobr> The appellants contended that all the elements of the respondent\u2019s alleged tortious acts occurred in Singapore, and therefore that the <i>Albaforth</i> principle should be given its full weight. Following from this, the appellants submitted that since the tort claims should be heard in Singapore, it made sense that the claims in equity should be heard in Singapore as well, so that the claims could be heard together.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent dealt with these arguments by submitting that the strength of the <i>Albaforth</i> principle depends on the facts of every case: <i>The Forum Craftsman</i> [1985] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 291. The strength of the presumption in every case turns upon the likely issues in dispute: <i>The Xin Yang</i>. This is consistent with the approach in <i>Spiliada</i> of determining the best forum to decide the case in the interests of the parties and to achieve the ends of justice. In the present case, an analysis of the alleged causes of action would not be either simple or clear. At the hearing before us, the appellants made the cogent rebuttal that <i>The Forum Craftsman</i> was distinguishable as Ackner\u00a0LJ had made it clear that the <i>Albaforth</i> principle did not apply to torts that were committed on moving vehicles such as ships and aeroplanes, which was not the case here.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, a close reading of <i>Albaforth</i> and <i>Berezovksy</i> does indeed support the appellants\u2019 contention that, as a general rule, the place where a tort occurred is <i>prima facie</i> the natural forum for determining the claim. Lord Steyn\u2019s judgment in <i>Berezovsky</i> sought to accommodate the <i>Albaforth</i> principle within the traditional <i>Spiliada</i> formulation. His Lordship opined that while Lord\u00a0Goff of Chieveley\u2019s analysis in <i>Spiliada</i> sought to explore and explain the legal principles and provide guidance, it did not examine exhaustively the classes of cases that could arise in practice. The principle contained in <i>Albaforth</i>, on the other hand, was concerned with \u201cpractical problems at a much lower level of generality\u201d (<i>Berezovsky</i> at 1014). His Lordship also suggested that there was a very fine distinction between a <i>prima facie</i> position, <i>ie</i>,</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">considering the place where the tort occurred as the <i>prima facie</i> natural forum, and treating the same factor as a weighty circumstance pointing towards a particular forum.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>Albaforth</i> principle was also confirmed in <i>The Xin Yang</i>, where Clarke\u00a0J emphasised that the place where the tort occurred is of some significance as a pointer towards the natural forum, even if the parties have limited connection with that jurisdiction. Importantly, however, Clarke\u00a0J\u2019s approach suggests that the result reached by applying the <i>Albaforth</i> principle is only one of the factors to be considered in the <i>Spiliada</i> balancing exercise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our opinion, the principle articulated in <i>Albaforth</i> is logical and sound, and should be applied in Singapore. As Robert Goff\u00a0LJ (as he then was) stated in <i>Albaforth</i></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">(at 96):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[W]here it is held that a Court has jurisdiction on the basis that an alleged tort has been committed within the jurisdiction of the Court, the test which has been satisfied in order to reach that conclusion is one founded on the basis that the Court, so having jurisdiction, is the most appropriate Court to try the claim, where it is manifestly just and reasonable that the defendant should answer for his wrongdoing. This being so, it must usually be difficult in any particular case to resist the conclusion that a Court which has jurisdiction on that basis must also be the natural forum for the trial of the action. If the substance of an alleged tort is committed within a certain jurisdiction, it is not easy to imagine what other facts could displace the conclusion that the Courts of that jurisdiction are the natural forum.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we must emphasise that the result that is arrived at through the application of the <i>Albaforth</i> principle is only the <i>prima facie</i> position and/or a weighty factor pointing in favour of that jurisdiction. Applying this to the present case, the fact that the respondent\u2019s alleged torts were committed in Singapore does point towards Singapore as being the natural forum to hear the dispute, but this is only one of the factors to be taken into account in the overall analysis, albeit a significant one.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We do note, however, that the respondent did suggest that, in so far at least as the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit was concerned, this may not have in fact been committed (if at all) in Singapore. However, as we point out below (at [72]), such an argument was, with respect, unclear \u2013 especially in terms of specific detail. We deal, in fact, with this particular argument in the context of the issue of choice of law below (at [72]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Choice of law</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Introduction</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of law issues are relevant even to a question of jurisdiction. The relevance of choice of law considerations in a <i>jurisdictional</i> enquiry regarding the \u201cnatural forum\u201d lies in the general proposition that where a dispute is governed by a foreign <i>lex causae</i>, the forum would be less adept in applying this law than the courts of the jurisdiction from which the <i>lex causae</i> originates. While it is true that the courts of a country (for example, Singapore courts) can apply the laws of another country (for example, German law) to a dispute, there will clearly be savings in time and resources if a court applies the law of its own jurisdiction to the substantive dispute. Hence, choice of law considerations can be a significant factor in determining the appropriate forum to hear a dispute.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choice of law questions raise a related issue regarding a party\u2019s evidential burden to plead foreign law. In <i>Goh Chok Tong v Tang Liang Hong</i> <nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 641</nobr>, Lai Kew Chai\u00a0J pointed pertinently to <i>the need for foreign law to be pleaded</i>, and held that if foreign law was not in fact pleaded, it would be presumed to be the same as the relevant position under Singapore law (see generally at [77]\u2013[84], and especially at [79]): see also <i>Ertel Bieber and Company</i> <i>v Rio Tinto Company, Limited</i> <nobr>[1918] AC 260</nobr> at 294\u2013295. Where this evidentiary presumption can be invoked, the applicability of a foreign <i>lex causae</i> under choice of law rules may therefore be reduced in significance since the forum is unlikely to have difficulty applying a foreign law which is (assumed to be) identical to the <i>lex fori</i>. In this regard, however, a number of cases suggest that a court may, despite a party\u2019s failure to adduce proof of foreign law, have regard to the fact that the principles in the foreign jurisdiction concerned will, in all likelihood, differ from the <i>lex fori</i> in some respects (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of <i>PT\u00a0Jaya Putra Kundur Indah v Guthrie Overseas Investments Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1996] SGHC 285</nobr> at [44] (\u201c<i>PT Jaya</i>\u201d)). Hence, in the present case, the mere factum of a foreign <i>lex causae</i>, <i>ie</i>, German law, may be accorded due weight <i>despite</i> the respondent\u2019s failure to adduce evidence regarding the content of this law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present proceedings, the appellants\u2019 arguments relating to choice of law can be briefly summarised as such: The choice of law provision in the Employment Agreement was not exclusive and pertained only to questions arising from the employment contract. Hence, the Judge should have applied common law choice of law principles. These principles would have led to the conclusion that Singapore law should be applied. The existence of the Employment Agreement did not detract from the applicability of these general principles. Before us, the respondent did not dispute that the choice of law clause is non-exclusive. Instead, he focused his arguments on the choice of law rules that should apply.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The relevance (if any) of the Employment Agreement</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A crucial consideration that weighed with the Judge was what he perceived to be the appellants\u2019 attempt to avoid the governing law provision in the Employment Agreement (\u201cthe governing law provision\u201d). As he put it (at [42] of the GD):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 I did not think it was sufficient for Mr\u00a0Bull to rely on the principle that it was for the plaintiffs to choose whether to sue in contract or tort. The real issue was whether the plaintiffs can avoid the governing law provision in the 30\u00a0June 2003 agreement by couching their causes of action outside of contract even though the duties allegedly owed by [the respondent] arose from his contractual appointment and the alleged breaches arose in the course of his performance of his contractual obligations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This concern was reiterated by the Judge a little later on in the judgment (see the GD at [45]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, however, absent bad faith on the part of the appellants, we see no reason why they should be denied the freedom of choice to frame their causes of action in the way they have. This has in fact been made clear in the case law. It is, for example, established law that the mere presence of a contractual relationship does not in itself preclude the existence of an <i>independent</i> duty of care in tort: see the leading House of Lords decision of <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 AC 145</nobr> as well as the decision of this court in <i>The Jian He</i> <nobr>[2000] 1 SLR 8</nobr> at [26]. Liability can exist concurrently in tort and contract, and provided that the latter does not expressly limit or exclude the former, a plaintiff is free to choose whichever is more advantageous to him: see <i>Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp</i> <nobr>[1979] Ch 384.</nobr></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are of the view that the appellants had the right to avail themselves of the cause of action that was most advantageous to them, <i>inter alia</i>, in the light of choice of law considerations. Given the way they were framed, their claims must be treated as claims in tort, and the fact that the respondent\u2019s actions arose from his contract becomes irrelevant for the purposes of characterising the issues involved. It is certainly the case that the respondent\u2019s actions were carried out in the course of his employment and in the course of performing his contractual obligations. Indeed, his actions probably also constituted breaches of implied terms of the employment contract. However, even while this is true, his actions incurred <i>tortious</i> liability that existed independently of, and concurrently with, his <i>contractual</i> obligations and breaches thereof. In other words, although the allegedly tortious acts were committed in the course of the respondent\u2019s employment <i>in fact</i>, the acts had a separate <i>legal</i> existence from his contractual obligations and breaches thereof. In this regard, we also note the following observations by Robert Goff\u00a0LJ (as he then was) (and with whom both Oliver and Waller\u00a0LJJ agreed) in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Coupland v Arabian Gulf Oil Co</i> <nobr>[1983] 1 WLR 1136</nobr> at 1153 (significantly, Goff\u00a0LJ was also to deliver the leading judgment (as Lord\u00a0Goff of Chieveley) in <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i>:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The plaintiff can advance his claim, as he wishes, either in contract or in tort; and no doubt he will, acting on advice, advance the claim on the basis which is most advantageous to him. It appears that he is likely to proceed primarily on the basis of his claim in tort [as opposed to contract], for reasons which I suspect are connected with the assessment of damages.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, this is not to state that the governing law provision is necessarily irrelevant since the appellants\u2019 <i>other</i> claims may, for choice of law purposes, nevertheless be characterised as issues arising in the realm of contract. As we shall see, where the appellants\u2019 cause of action in <i>equity</i> is concerned, the issue arises as to whether or not, <i>assuming</i> that equity does not constitute (in and of itself) an <i>independent</i> category with its own choice of law rules, the choice of law rules relating to <i>contract</i> should be invoked instead for, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, one would not be able to characterise the respective causes of action by reference to equity. In <i>such</i> a situation, the Employment Agreement in general and the governing law provision in particular would be relevant since, unlike their claims against the respondent in tort, the appellants\u2019 claims against the respondent in equity ought to be <i>characterised differently</i>. But this is a quite different situation compared to the bare proposition that litigants such as the appellants are <i>ipso facto</i> prevented from framing their respective causes of action the way they did (here, in tort) merely because by doing so, they would be avoiding the governing law provision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We pause here to note, parenthetically, that, in so far as the <i>German proceedings</i> are concerned, even taking the respondent\u2019s case at its highest, the <i>German</i> court would <i>necessarily</i> have to take into account <i>the allegations of misconduct against the respondent \u2013 which allegations constitute the very pith and marrow of the Singapore proceedings</i> mounted by the appellants against the respondent, and which are in fact the focus of the present proceedings. In other words, the <i>fundamental legal and factual substratum</i> of the appellants\u2019defence in the <i>German</i> proceedings comprises the allegations of misconduct against the respondent. If these allegations are proved, then the appellants would be exonerated in so far as the German proceedings are concerned (bearing in mind that the alleged wrongful termination of the Employment Agreement constitutes the main thrust of the German proceedings, one of the remaining two claims having been largely satisfied, with the final claim being (in effect) a request for information). The contrary result would of course obtain if the allegations are not in fact proved. That this ought \u2013 and, indeed, would \u2013 be the situation is acknowledged by counsel for the respondent, Mr\u00a0Leung Wing Wah, himself (see the GD at [33] and [34]). So it seems to us, without even speculating what the German court might do (which is impermissible in any event), that our decision on the relevant choice of law principles that would govern the respective claims of the appellants in the Singapore proceedings would be of at least <i>some</i> relevance to the German court \u2013 based on principles of comity, if nothing else. <i>More importantly</i>, it seems to us clear that the German court would also take into account the findings of <i>fact</i> of the Singapore court, particularly since the factual context \u2013 at least, as we shall see, in so far as the action in conversion is concerned \u2013 took place in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Returning to the issues at hand, we turn now to consider what the relevant principles of choice of law are with respect to the various claims brought by the appellants against the respondent in the present (Singapore) proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The claims in tort</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning, first, to the claims in <i>tort</i>, there are in fact two separate causes of action pleaded. One is in <i>conversion</i>, the other for <i>fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On a <i>general</i> level, however, the principles which obtain with regard to the issue of the choice of law in tort in the Singapore context are clear. These are embodied in the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d. Put simply, this rule states that in order for a tort to be actionable in Singapore, the alleged wrong must be actionable not only under the law of the forum (the <i>lex fori</i>) but also under the law of the place where the wrong was in fact committed (the <i>lex loci delicti</i>). In other words, both these limbs must be satisfied.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Prof\u00a0Adrian Briggs pointed out helpfully, the original rule centred on the former limb only (<i>viz</i>, relating to the <i>lex fori</i>) as \u201c[n]o doubt the historical reason for such a view was the closeness between torts and criminal wrongs, in that both involved breaches of duties not voluntarily undertaken, and in such cases the forum\u2019s own standards of justice should prevail\u201d (see Adrian Briggs, \u201cTort in the Conflict of Laws\u201d (1989) 105\u00a0LQR 359 at 359). This view was, as the learned author points out (<i>ibid</i>), later modified by the House of Lords in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> <nobr>[1971] AC 356</nobr> to include the second limb (<i>viz</i>, relating to the <i>lex loci delicti</i>). Such an approach, modifying the bias towards parochialism in general and the <i>lex fori</i> in particular, was adopted more than three decades ago. Such an underlying spirit is, of course, even more needful today.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The oft-cited starting point is the English decision of <i>Phillips v Eyre</i> (1870) LR\u00a06 QB 1, where Willes\u00a0J observed thus (at 28\u201329):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As a general rule, in order to found a suit in England for a wrong alleged to have been committed abroad, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the wrong must be of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed in England; \u2026 Secondly, the act must not have been justifiable by the law of the place where it was done.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u201cmodern\u201d starting point, however, is the House of Lords decision in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> ([54] <i>supra</i>). Although it confirmed the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d, a close perusal of the various judgments delivered is, with respect, apt to lead to at least a modicum of uncertainty. An excellent summary of the various judgments (and accompanying differences) can be found in Yeo Tiong Min, \u201cTort Choice of Law Beyond the <i>Red Sea</i>: Whither the <i>Lex Fori</i>?\u201d (1997) 1\u00a0Sing\u00a0J\u00a0Int\u2019l &amp; Comp\u00a0L\u00a091 at 92\u201393. The various complications need not detain us, as there is a subsequent Hong Kong Privy Council decision which helped to clarify the position, particularly with regard to the ambit of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d: see <i>Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA</i> <nobr>[1995] 1 AC 190</nobr> (\u201cthe <i>Red Sea</i> case\u201d). The <i>Red Sea</i> case has been held by this court to be the law in Singapore: see <i>Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 579</nobr> at [36], citing and applying the Singapore High Court decision in <i>Goh Chok Tong v Tang Liang Hong</i> ([43] <i>supra</i>). What the <i>Red Sea</i> case now establishes is that the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d applies, but subject to the exception (first laid down by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> (at 391)) that, under certain circumstances, the tort might nevertheless be actionable in Singapore even though one of the limbs (mentioned at [53] above) is not satisfied. Indeed, in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> itself, the second limb (relating to actionability under the <i>lex loci delicti</i>) was not satisfied. What the <i>Red Sea</i> case effected was a symmetry which also recognised the operation of the exception even when the second limb (relating to actionability under the <i>lex fori</i>) had not been satisfied (Prof\u00a0Adrian Briggs aptly terms the resultant rule as \u201cone of double actionability subject to double flexibility\u201d: see Adrian Briggs, \u201c<i>The Halley</i>: Holed, but Still Afloat?\u201d (1995) 111\u00a0LQR 18 at 21). Such an approach is, of course, consistent with the tenets of globalisation and internationalisation that now accompany the central idea of comity (together with the corresponding need to eschew parochialism). Indeed, the decision in the <i>Red Sea</i> case paves the way for the <i>lex causae</i> of a tort to be the law of a <i>third</i> jurisdiction (other than the <i>lex fori</i> or the <i>lex loci delicti</i>), which has the most significant relationship with the occurrence and with the parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The central difficulty with such an exception, however, is that an overly liberal application of it might lead, in effect, to an emasculation or even <i>de facto</i> abolition of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d and may, in the worst case scenario, result in a \u201cproper law of the tort\u201d approach instead (<i>cf</i> also Briggs ([56] <i>supra</i> at 20)). This is the perennial danger when exceptions are made to existing rules. Yet, such exceptions are both inevitable and (more importantly) necessary, lest an ossified set of rules result, which will invariably lead to injustice and unfairness. For example, if the parties and other connecting factors have nothing to do with the place where the tort was actually committed (<i>ie</i>, that that place merely happened to be fortuitous), then it would appear both just and fair to hold that the fact that the second limb of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d (that the wrong also be actionable under the <i>lex loci delicti</i>) is not satisfied should not prejudice the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Indeed, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Hence, by the same token, if the same scenario obtains, but in relation to the <i>lex fori</i> instead, then it would also appear both just and fair to hold that the fact that the first limb of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d (that the wrong also be actionable under the <i>lex fori</i>) is not satisfied should (equally) not prejudice the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Indeed, where the parties and other connecting factors have nothing to do with either the place where the action is brought (here, Singapore) and the place where the wrong was committed, a <i>third</i> possible law might govern the action concerned (as alluded to at the end of the preceding paragraph). The overriding consideration is that a just result be achieved.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, in order that the exception might not \u201coverwhelm\u201d the rule (here, the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d), it is imperative that the exception be strictly applied. It is perhaps less than useful to state that this will depend on the precise facts of the case at hand, but there does not, in our view, appear to be any better way of stating the parameters of the exception. As one learned commentator aptly put it, \u201c[t]he scope of the exception to the \u2018general rule\u2019 to which their Lordships have had resort in the <i>Red Sea</i> \u2026 case <i>cannot be defined with pedantic precision</i>\u201d [emphasis added] (see P\u00a0B\u00a0Carter, \u201cChoice of Law in Tort: The Role of the <i>Lex Fori</i>\u201d <nobr>[1995] CLJ 38</nobr> at 39). The important point is, rather, one of <i>attitude</i>. In other words, the Singapore courts must not be quick to apply the exception unless the <i>lex fori</i> and/or the <i>lex loci delicti</i> are purely fortuitous and the application of either or both limbs of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d would result in injustice and unfairness. The Singapore courts \u2013 indeed, any court in any jurisdiction \u2013 would, in our view, be well-equipped to analyse any given fact situation based on these criteria.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The more difficult question that arises, however, is whether or not a <i>local tort</i> (<i>ie</i>, a tort committed (here) in <i>Singapore</i>) would be subject to this exception. Indeed, at a threshold level, it might be asked whether a local tort ought to be subject to the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d in the first place. In this last-mentioned regard, it might be argued that this is a moot point since, even if the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d applies, there would <i>not</i> be a <i>practical</i> difference since both the <i>lex fori</i> and the <i>lex loci delicti</i> would be the <i>same</i> (<i>ie</i>, <i>Singapore</i> law). This being the case, the rule would be satisfied in any event (reference may also be made, in this regard, to the English decisions in <i>Szalatnay-Stacho v Fink</i> <nobr>[1947] KB 1</nobr> and <i>Metall und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc</i> <nobr>[1990] 1 QB 391</nobr> (\u201c<i>Metall und Rohstoff</i>\u201d)). The more pertinent question, perhaps, is whether or not the <i>exception</i> to the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d (most fully articulated, as we have seen, in the <i>Red Sea</i> case) applies even in the context of a <i>local tort</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The point appears to have been left open in a leading work, although it appears, in the final analysis, to <i>lean</i> <i>against</i> the application of the exception in the context of a local tort (see Sir\u00a0Peter North &amp; J\u00a0J\u00a0Fawcett, <i>Cheshire and North\u2019s Private International Law</i> (Butterworths, 13th\u00a0Ed, 1999) at pp\u00a0613\u2013614). The learned authors do in fact consider the <i>Red Sea</i> case, but point out (see <i>ibid</i>):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the Privy Council in the <i>Red Sea</i> case there is no mention at all of the position in relation to torts committed in England. This case was concerned, in effect, with the displacement of English law by that of the foreign law of the place where the tort was committed and not with the displacement of the English law of the place where the tort was committed by a foreign law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, it is then admitted that (see p\u00a0614):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Arguably, though</span></i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, the decision [in the <i>Red Sea</i> case] <i>raises a question mark</i> over the position in respect of torts committed in England in that it accepts for the first time that a flexible exception may lead to the displacement of English law by a foreign law. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, the learned authors conclude thus (see <i>ibid</i>):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Nonetheless, it must remain doubtful</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">whether an exception would ever be held to operate in the situation where a tort is committed in England. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The views expressed in the preceding paragraph notwithstanding, the need to ensure that the requirements of comity are observed and the corresponding need to avoid unwarranted parochialism would appear to suggest that the exception ought to apply, even in the context of local torts. In this regard, we note that one learned scholar (see Yeo ([56] <i>supra</i>) at 110\u2013111) has expressed the view that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Before [the] <i>Red Sea</i> [case] \u2026 given the paramountcy of the <i>lex fori</i> \u2026 the <i>lex fori</i> rule for local torts made some sense. Since the <i>lex fori</i> coincided with the <i>lex loci delicti</i>, and it was not yet possible to have an exception to the application of the <i>lex fori</i>, it was only sensible to short-circuit the process in favour of a simple <i>lex fori</i> rule. \u2026 However, the only justification for reserving such inhibitions to torts committed within the jurisdiction can be forum preference, and any dimunition of the present role of the <i>lex fori</i> may shed some needed light in this area. Once the inhibitions are openly confronted, the dichotomy of treatment between local and foreign torts will prove difficult to justify.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In other words, it might, in certain exceptional circumstances, be possible for a law <i>other than Singapore law</i> to apply, even in the case of a local tort. Although the <i>Red Sea</i> case did not <i>in fact</i> relate to a situation involving a local tort, the <i>general principles</i> contained therein would, in our view, apply equally in the context of local torts. In particular, the rationale underlying the exception in so far as <i>foreign</i> torts are concerned (brief illustrations of which have been given at [55] above) would, in our view, apply <i>equally</i> (as a matter of both principle and logic) to <i>local</i> torts as well. We have in mind, in particular, the situation where the fact that the tort has been committed in Singapore is a <i>wholly fortuitous</i> <i>happenstance</i> that has nothing whatsoever to do with every other aspect of the case concerned. In such a situation, it would seem to us to be neither just nor fair to insist that the exception should be excluded and that Singapore law should apply. In this regard, we do not see any distinction in either logic or principle between the situation concerning a foreign tort and that concerning a local tort.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that there is authority which suggests that where a <i>local</i> tort is concerned, the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d does not apply and that the <i>lex fori</i> would, presumably, apply instead (see, for example, <i>Metall und Rohstoff</i> ([59] <i>supra</i>), especially at 445\u2013447 as well as the Supreme Court of Canada decision of <i>Interprovincial Co-operatives Ltd v The Queen in Right of Manitoba</i> (1975) 53\u00a0DLR (3d) 321 at 339\u2013340). As just mentioned, however, such an approach militates not only against both principle and logic but also against considerations of comity as well. Most importantly, however, and as already argued above, such an approach could, on occasion, lead to actual injustice \u2013 especially where (as already mentioned) the fact that the tort was committed in Singapore was <i>purely fortuitous</i>. Indeed, a blanket and blatant predilection for the <i>lex fori</i> is no longer sustainable \u2013 especially during present times. It also bears repeating that in the <i>ordinary</i> course of events, application of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d to <i>local</i> torts will not in fact result in any difference from both practical as well as conceptual points of view (see also [59] above). In any event, even if the focus is on the <i>lex fori</i>, an <i>exception</i> ought, as already argued above, to be made for situations where the fact that the tort was committed in Singapore was purely fortuitous. If so, then there would be very little difference (if any) in substance between that particular approach and the application of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our only concern was whether or not an <i>even stricter</i> approach ought to be taken in applying the exception to <i>local</i> torts compared to <i>foreign</i> torts. On further reflection, we do not see why this ought to be the case. This follows from the general reasoning canvassed in the last part of the preceding paragraph. Indeed, to apply the exception in a stricter fashion to local torts (as opposed to foreign torts) would in fact undermine the general need for comity which is an integral part of the jurisprudence relating to the conflict of laws. But we need to underscore one point: The exception to the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d is precisely that and must be applied only when the factual matrix as well as the justice and fairness of the case warrant it. A liberal approach must be eschewed, lest the structure and integrity of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d be undermined or (worse still) destroyed. Whatever the relative merits (or otherwise) of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d, it is still the law in Singapore. Indeed, a wise and judicious application of the exception in appropriate cases will ensure that the retention of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d does not place the Singapore courts in a less advantageous position compared to other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom where the law has been reformed. The following wise counsel by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> ([54] <i>supra</i> at 391) bears repeating:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It [the exception] will not be invoked in every case or even, probably, in many cases. The general rule must apply unless clear and satisfying grounds are shown why it should be departed from and what solution, derived from what other rule, should be preferred. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The above observations were, not surprisingly, reiterated in the <i>Red Sea</i> case ([56] <i>supra</i> at 206). In any event, any abolition or reform of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d is, if at all, a subject for <i>legislative</i> reform. Reference may be made, in this particular regard, to the Report of the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law entitled <i>Reform of the Choice of Law Rule Relating to Torts</i> (31\u00a0March 2003) where, with the exception of claims in defamation, it was recommended that the requirement for actionability by the law of the forum (<i>viz</i>, the <i>lex fori</i>) be abrogated and that the choice of law rule be the law where the act was done (<i>viz</i>, the <i>lex loci delicti</i>) <i>and</i> that <i>a flexible exception</i> to the choice of law rule may be invoked in exceptional circumstances, allowing the court to apply the law of a country that is significantly connected with the tort (a preference for this approach was also expressed by Woo Bih Li\u00a0J in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Ang Ming Chuang v Singapore Airlines Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] 1 SLR 409</nobr> at [50]). We would only pause to observe that, in <i>practical</i> terms, the flexibility accorded by the wise and judicious use of the <i>flexible exception</i> to the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d ensures that the court concerned would, nevertheless, be able to achieve a just and fair result in the meantime even if the law is not reformed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would be appropriate to turn now to the application of the principles considered in this part of the judgment to the respective heads of claim the appellants have raised in the tortious context.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">THE\u00a0CLAIM\u00a0IN CONVERSION</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning, first, to the appellants\u2019 claim in conversion, there is no doubt that the <i>lex fori</i> is Singapore law. It seems to us also clear that, having regard to the facts of the present case in general and the location of the 25 pieces of the Tang Cargo alleged to have been converted by the respondent in particular, that the <i>lex loci delicti</i> is also Singapore law. To all intents and purposes, therefore, the <i>lex causae</i> for the claim in conversion would appear to <i>prima facie</i> be Singapore law exclusively.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, Mr\u00a0Leung argued that the respondent would be relying on a <i>defence</i> that had its source in the Employment Agreement, which is governed by German law (<i>cf</i> also <i>Coupland v Arabian Gulf Oil Co</i> ([48] <i>supra</i>) at 1153). This alleged defence is, however, both vague and unclear. No specific term of the Employment Agreement was referred to. The argument against Singapore being the natural forum by reason of the need to apply a foreign <i>lex causae</i> would therefore appear to be of negligible significance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are also of the view that the exception to the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d does not apply in the context of the present claim. Indeed, as we have already observed, most of the relevant connecting factors relate to Singapore (as opposed to Germany).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">THE CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION OR DECEIT</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">71</span><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Turning, next, to the appellants\u2019 claim based on the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit, it is first of all clear that the <i>lex fori</i> for this claim would be Singapore law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, Mr\u00a0Leung argued that (contrary to counsel for the appellants, Mr\u00a0Cavinder Bull\u2019s, assertion) the <i>lex loci delicti</i> was not Singapore law as the alleged misrepresentations were actionable where they had been received and that they had been received in either Germany or New Zealand, and not in Singapore (<i>cf</i> the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal Ltd</i> <nobr>[1979] QB 333</nobr> at 345\u2013346). However, the fact of the matter was that it was not clear, on the pleadings, <i>where</i> the alleged misrepresentations were in fact received. This is not surprising in view of the fact that only the appellants\u2019 statement of claim is available. The respondent had, not surprisingly, applied for a stay without filing a defence. On this fact alone, we are inclined to the view that the respondent\u2019s argument in this regard, whilst ingenious, is rather speculative. Further, as with the claim in conversion, the respondent has not adduced any evidence as to why the exception to the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d should apply in the context of the present proceedings. Hence, both limbs of the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d apply.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">CONCLUSION</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">73</span><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is clear, from the analysis above, that the governing law for both the appellants\u2019 claims (in conversion and for fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit) is Singapore law. Indeed, the \u201cdouble actionability rule\u201d has been satisfied in respect of both claims and the exception to that rule does not apply on the facts of the present proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The claims in equity</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning, next, to the claims in <i>equity</i>, these, too, comprise two separate causes of action. One is for <i>breach of confidence</i>, the other for <i>breach of fiduciary duties</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">75<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> We note, at the outset, that the principles relating to choice of law with regard to claims in equity are not entirely clear. We are therefore especially grateful to have the benefit of the views of the leading expert in the field in Singapore (and, indeed, the Commonwealth) as embodied in a very scholarly volume which, if we may say so, has justly received widespread praise: see T\u00a0M\u00a0Yeo, <i>Choice of Law for Equitable Doctrines</i> (Oxford University Press, 2004) (\u201c<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Yeo</i>\u201d). Indeed, this is the seminal work in the field in the Commonwealth and is based on the author\u2019s doctoral thesis completed at Oxford University (a summary of his main theses can be found in Tiong Min Yeo, \u201cChoice of Law for Equity\u201d in ch\u00a07 of <i>Equity in Commercial Law</i> <span style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: italic\">(</span>Simone Degeling &amp; James Edelman eds) (Law Book Co, 2005)). There is in fact little by way of direct authority in this particular area of the law and the learned author does rely much on first principles. His views are therefore especially valuable in the circumstances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It used to be thought that the <i>lex causae</i> for claims in equity would generally be the <i>lex fori</i> (in these proceedings, Singapore law). The central insight of Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s book (referred to in the preceding paragraph) is the suggestion of a more nuanced approach. Put simply, there would not, <i>ipso facto</i>, be an automatic and blanket application of the <i>lex fori</i> in any and every situation of this nature. Instead, the nature and origins of the equitable obligations concerned would need to be closely examined in the context of their respective factual matrices. In our view, such an approach is undoubtedly sound. The adoption of the <i>lex fori</i> as the <i>lex causae</i> for <i>all</i> issues arising in equity would fail to recognise the disparate doctrines and causes of action arising in equity. Such an approach would be no different from a suggestion that all common law claims, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, should be governed by the <i>lex fori</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With these preliminary \u2013 and perhaps slightly oversimplified \u2013 remarks which do not do justice to the work just considered, we turn now to consider the specific issues presently before us. Indeed, as it turns out, both equitable causes of action framed by the appellant in the Singapore proceedings (<i>viz</i>, the alleged breach of fiduciary duties as well as breach of confidence) raise common issues.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first common issue stems from the fact that both causes of action could each arise from a variety of possible bases (see <i>Yeo</i> ([75] <i>supra</i>)). For example, a breach of fiduciary duty could arise from a contract or, alternatively, could arise from a voluntary undertaking that is not, strictly speaking, contractual in nature. Indeed, the nature and sources of fiduciary duties are so varied that no single set of principles governs this area of law (see generally, for example, L\u00a0S\u00a0Sealy, \u201cFiduciary Relationships\u201d <nobr>[1962] CLJ 69</nobr> and, by the same author, \u201cSome Principles of Fiduciary Obligation\u201d <nobr>[1963] CLJ 119</nobr> and \u201cFiduciary Obligations, Forty Years On\u201d (1995) 9\u00a0JCL 37; as well as the oft-cited Australian High Court decision of <i>Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation</i> (1984) 156\u00a0CLR 41 (\u201c<i>Hospital Products</i>\u201d), especially at 68\u201369 and 141\u2013142). The actual legal position would depend very much on the particular factual context. This is perhaps why Prof\u00a0Yeo observes that \u201cthere is general agreement that the existence and content of fiduciary duties are situation-specific\u201d (see <i>Yeo</i> at para\u00a07.26). To exacerbate matters, there are legal systems that do not recognise the concept of fiduciary duty (at least not specifically in the context of civil law systems, as to which, see <i>Yeo</i> at para\u00a07.34). And even within jurisdictions that do recognise such a concept, there also arise differences of views from the perspective of content (see <i>Yeo</i> at para\u00a07.24).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a similar vein, the learned author also observes that \u201c[t]he theoretical basis of the claim [for breach of confidence] is unclear\u201d and \u201chas been argued variously to be based on contract, tort, breach of fiduciary duty, restitution, trusts, or property\u201d (see <i>Yeo</i> at para\u00a07.73). This is within the common law context. The situation in the civil law context is described by the learned author as being \u201cserved by the law of contract and wrongs, and sometimes the criminal law\u201d (see <i>ibid</i>; see also <i>id</i> at para\u00a07.74). There are also further possible complications introduced as a result of the difficulties inherent within the process of <i>characterisation</i> of the specific issue or issues that arise from the facts at hand (see, albeit not in the context of equity, the oft-cited English High Court decision of <i>Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust Plc (No\u00a03)</i> <nobr>[1995] 1 WLR 978</nobr>; affirmed on different grounds by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust Plc (No\u00a03)</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 WLR 387</nobr>, analysed incisively in <i>Yeo</i> at paras\u00a03.12\u20133.20 and Adrian Briggs in \u201cDecisions of British Courts During 1996 Involving Questions of Public or Private International Law\u201d (1996) 67\u00a0BYIL 537 at 605\u2013606).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">80<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The possible \u2013 and different \u2013 bases as well as sources for both a breach of fiduciary duty and a breach of confidence (both within the common law and civil law jurisdictions alike) themselves suggest that Prof\u00a0Yeo is correct in arguing that a blanket rule to the effect that the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">lex fori</i> would always apply is inappropriate (<i>cf</i> the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Sumitomo Bank Ltd v Kartika Ratna Thahir</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 735</nobr> at 787\u2013791, [140]\u2013[172]; affirmed in <i>Kartika Ratna Thahir v PT\u00a0Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina)</i> <nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 257</nobr>, especially at 272, [37] as well as the Malaysian High Court decision of <i>Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd v Lorrain Esme Osman</i> <nobr>[1987] 1 MLJ 502</nobr> at 506 and the Australian Federal Court decision of <i>Paramasivam v Flynn</i> (1998) 160\u00a0ALR 203, especially at 215\u2013217 (which embodies a slight variation in approach); but <i>cf</i>, in turn, the perceptive analysis of Prof\u00a0Yeo (see <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Yeo</i> ([75] <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">supra</i>) at paras\u00a07.68\u20137.70 and 7.65, and, by the same author, \u201cChoice of Law for Fiduciary Duties\u201d (1999) 115\u00a0LQR 571, respectively). A blanket rule is also undesirable inasmuch as it tends to undermine considerations of comity that are an integral part of the theory as well as practice of the conflict of laws nowadays. However, that having been said, it is equally important that one does not slide towards the other extreme either \u2013 where the choice of law is not governed by any rules or principles but is premised on what is, in effect, mere arbitrary choice. To do so would undermine the very precept underlying the conflict of laws, which is premised on the formulation of choice of law rules which distil the critical connecting factor in a given area of substantive law. Underlying Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s central thesis in his work is the premise that the concept of equity is <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">not</i> a separate and distinct category in itself (see, for example, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Yeo</i> at paras\u00a02.14\u20132.15 and 3.22). Hence, it is important to ascertain the foundational sources from which equitable rights and remedies arise \u2013 which would include, <i>inter alia</i>, established categories such as contract and tort. Indeed, it has been held that contractual terms may even authorise what would otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary duty (see, for example, the Supreme Court of Canada decision of <i>Molchan v Omega Oil &amp; Gas Ltd</i> (1988) 47\u00a0DLR (4th) 481, especially at 492 and <i>Hospital Products</i> ([78] <i>supra</i>) at 102), although the converse does not follow (see, for example, the United States Court of Appeals (Fifth Circuit) decision of <i>The Deauville Corporation v Federated Department Stores, Inc</i> 756 F\u00a02d 1183 (1985) at 1194 as well as <i>Hospital Products Limited</i> at 97; and applied in the Bermudan Privy Council decision of <i>Horace Brenton Kelly v Margot Cooper</i> <nobr>[1993] AC 205</nobr> at 215)). However, there can be no fixed rules as such. For example, the view to the effect that equitable wrongs could be subsumed under tort instead has been criticised (convincingly, in our view) by a learned author, not least because of the very nature (including the variety and complexity) of the choice of law rules for tort across Commonwealth jurisdictions (see Laurette Barnard, \u201cChoice of Law in Equitable Wrongs: A Comparative Analysis\u201d <nobr>[1992] CLJ 474</nobr>, especially at 500\u2013503).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Returning to Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s thesis, whilst his premise (<i>viz</i>, to ascertain the foundational sources from which equitable rights and remedies arise) is not unpersuasive (particularly if we have regard to the discussion above), we would <i>not</i> go so far as to endorse the proposition that equitable concepts and doctrines are <i>always</i> dependent on other established categories (because, as the modern law of restitution illustrates, the law itself never ceases to develop). We would, however, accept the more <i>limited</i> proposition to the effect that where equitable duties (here, in relation to both breach of fiduciary duty and breach of confidence) arise from a factual matrix where the legal foundation is premised on an independent established category such as contract or tort, the appropriate principle in so far as the choice of law is concerned ought to be centred on the established category concerned. We would also leave open the possibility that future legal developments might result in equitable obligations constituting a separate established category in so far as choice of law is concerned (and <i>cf</i>, in this regard, Robert Stevens, \u201cChoice of Law for Equity: Is it Possible?\u201d in ch\u00a08 of <i>Equity in Commercial Law</i> ([75] <i>supra</i>)).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With that more limited and modest proposition in mind, we turn now to consider the alleged breaches in the instant proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear, in our view, that the content of the claims centring around the allegations of breach of fiduciary duty as well as breach of confidence <i>arise from the Employment Agreement itself</i> \u2013 or, more specifically, from the relationship established therein. It is true that there is a persuasive argument (at least from the perspective of Singapore law) to the effect that these duties are really to be <i>implied</i> (in law) from the relationship between the contracting parties themselves. It is established law that it is an implied term of an employment contract that an employee owes his or her employer a duty of good faith and fidelity (see the oft-cited English decisions of <i>Robb v Green</i> <nobr>[1895] 2 QB 315</nobr> and <i>Hivac Limited v Park Royal Scientific Instruments Limited</i> <nobr>[1946] Ch 169</nobr>). However, it is equally true that, in the context of the <i>conflict of laws</i>, one ought not to view the situation through the lenses of domestic (here, contract) law since (as is the case here) the governing law of the contract is in fact German law. If so, it would appear that the alleged breach of fiduciary duty as well as the alleged breach of confidence, having (on <i>these facts</i>) their <i>root source</i> in <i>the Employment Agreement</i>, the governing choice of law rules ought to be based on those governing this particular <i>contract</i> (in this instance, <i>German law</i>; see also generally <i>Yeo</i> ([75] <i>supra</i>) at paras\u00a07.30\u20137.31, 7.39\u20137.45, 7.49, 7.75, 7.77 and 7.82 (interestingly and parenthetically, though, Prof\u00a0Yeo is of the view that, \u201c[o]utside the relationship context, breach of confidence should be characterized as a tort for choice of law purposes\u201d: see <i>id</i> at para\u00a08.77)).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we would pause to observe that whilst the appellants\u2019 actions for both breach of fiduciary duty as well as for breach of confidence are to be governed by the choice of law principles relating to <i>contract</i> (in this instance, <i>German law</i>), the more pertinent inquiry is, in the context of <i>these</i> particular proceedings, a <i>factual</i> one in general and what transpired with regard to the respondent\u2019s dealings with the STB in particular (see also <i>Oriental Insurance</i> ([17] <i>supra</i>) at [40]). In this regard, we are thrown back, as it were, to the testimony not only of the respondent but (and more importantly) of Mr\u00a0Koh and Mrs\u00a0Lee as well. Looked at in this light, the focus (as we have already seen at [25] above) is on <i>Singapore.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Conclusion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, given the fact that <i>Singapore</i> law ought to be the governing law with regard to the appellants\u2019 claims in tort and that <i>German</i> law ought to be the governing law with regard to the appellants\u2019 claims in equity, we are of the view that choice of law considerations are, on the whole and at best, a <i>neutral</i> factor in the <i>Spiliada</i> balancing exercise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The effect of concurrent proceedings in Germany</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was, on the facts of the present proceedings, clearly no <i>lis alibi pendens</i> involved.

In the English High Court decision of <i>The Coral Isis</i> [1986] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 413, Sheen\u00a0J stated (at 417):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In a case, such as this one, in which there is more than one appropriate forum, but no natural forum I do not regard a mere accident of time in the commencement of a suit as necessarily decisive of the question: in which Court should this action proceed?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking into account which action started first would encourage parties to start actions in their forums as quickly as possible, whether the claim has a good chance of success or not. Such a practice clearly should not be encouraged. Further, even though the action was first commenced in Germany, Germany may not be the most appropriate forum for the substantive hearing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also note that the German proceedings have not reached an advanced stage. Although the hearing has begun, the parties have only attended court on three occasions and only one witness has been heard. There has been consent judgment for part of the claim, pursuant to which the first appellant has paid \u20ac69,970. However, this judgment was for claims made by the respondent that were not disputed by the appellants as the respondent had furnished supporting documents to substantiate his claim. The bulk of the respondent\u2019s claims, including his claim for commission as well as for the balance of his salary and expenses, have not been fully heard. The partial judgment states that the German judge has also deferred an order as to costs until his final decision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, although the German proceedings are not at an advanced stage, there is nevertheless an overlap of both facts as well as issues between the German proceedings on the one hand and the Singapore proceedings on the other \u2013 particularly in so far as the issue of the respondent\u2019s alleged misconduct is concerned. In the circumstances, there is a risk of conflicting judgments, at least in so far as some issues are concerned. However, whilst this is a factor that must be taken into account, it is not decisive (bearing in mind that the concurrent proceedings in Singapore and Germany were respectively commenced by the appellants <i>and</i> the respondent, as opposed to a <i>lis alibi pendens</i>: see <i>PT\u00a0Jaya</i> ([43] <i>supra</i>) at [56]). The danger of conflicting judgments must be weighed against the other factors in the <i>Spiliada</i> enquiry and we have seen that, hitherto, the various factors point towards Singapore as being the most appropriate forum to hear the case. The relevant factors, when considered in their totality, strongly militate against any suggestion that the German courts would be \u201cclearly more appropriate\u201d than the Singapore courts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Stage Two</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Does justice require that a stay be refused?</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of our conclusion with regard to Stage One, it is, strictly speaking, unnecessary for us to consider Stage Two as such. We do so, however, for the sake of completeness. In this regard, Mr\u00a0Bull argued that granting the respondent a stay of the <i>Singapore</i> proceedings would result in the appellants\u2019 loss of a legitimate juridical advantage which would (in turn) result in injustice to them. He argued that this was due to the non-compellability of key witnesses (in particular, Mr\u00a0Koh and Mrs\u00a0Lee) if the proceedings were held in Germany instead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This particular argument was attractive at first blush, not least because, as we have noted above (at [90]), the main focus of the German proceedings would be on the allegations of misconduct on the part of the respondent in general and what transpired between the appellants and STB in particular. In this last-mentioned regard, the testimony of Mr\u00a0Koh and Mrs\u00a0Lee would be particularly significant. However, we are of the view that the appellants did not, in the final analysis, establish to our satisfaction that such a juridical advantage would in fact be lost simply because there was no clear evidence that the key witnesses would in fact be non-compellable pursuant to German law. What <i>was</i> clear was that these witnesses <i>would</i> be compellable under <i>Singapore</i> law. However, this would relate more to the question of connecting factors under Stage One \u2013 which we have found in favour of the appellants not only in so far as this factor is concerned but with regard to the issue of connecting factors generally. On a more general level, because the respective burdens of proof with regard to Stage One and Stage Two are different, the court should be alert to situations of overlap between these two stages (<i>cf</i> Briggs ([79] <i>supra</i>) at 587\u2013589).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">93</span><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></b> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Taking all the relevant factors into account, we are of the view that the appellants\u2019 action in the Singapore courts against the respondent ought <i>not</i> to be stayed. The connecting factors clearly point to Singapore as being the appropriate forum for the hearing of the substantive issues concerned. It is also clear that Singapore is the most natural and appropriate forum to hear the claims in tort. The issue of choice of law appears, as we have noted, to be neutral and, although there is a risk of conflicting decisions by the Singapore and German courts, this factor does not weigh decisively in the respondent\u2019s favour, having regard to the other factors.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances, therefore, we allow the appeal with costs, with the usual consequential orders to follow.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We invited counsel to address us on any other reliefs to which Hunter are entitled and on the question of costs here and below. We have since received and considered the submissions of counsel.<br/><br/>The court below held that the defence of innocent infringement was available to Soundtex, and that even if there was infringement of the registered design no damages would be awarded in respect of any infringement up to 12 June 1997 (ie the day on which Soundtex were notified by the solicitors for Hunter that Hunter are the proprietors of the design). We agree entirely. In any event, there was no appeal against this determination. Accordingly, there will be an inquiry as to damages only for infringement of the registered design committed by Soundtex after this date. We so order.<br/><br/>Counsel for Hunter also seeks an order for delivery up on oath and for destruction of all products, goods, documents and other articles and materials, the continued retention, use of or dealing with by Soundtex would offend the injunction. In reply, counsel for Soundtex submits that this relief is not necessary, as the injunction granted is sufficient. We agree. The court has a discretion whether or not to grant such relief and, should it decide to grant it, to limit the extent of such a relief. Such relief is granted not to punish the infringer but to give the necessary protection to the plaintiffs: per Russell J in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Mengenthaler Linotype Co v Intertype Co Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1926] 43 RPC 381</font>, 382. There is an injunction against Soundtex which they must obey and observe. In so far as they still hold or have any Soundtex boxes in their possession, custody or control, by reason of the injunction they cannot deal with them in any way. It should be borne in mind that the infringement here relates only to the design of the boxes, and in our view, to  order the delivery up and the destruction of all these boxes would be giving to Hunter a remedy far beyond what is necessary for their protection. In complying with the injunction, Soundtex should be allowed, if they so wish, to make changes to the boxes in such a way as not to infringe the registered design of Hunter. Alternatively, Soundtex may break up the boxes and use the materials or parts thereof for other purposes.<br/><br/><strong><i> Costs </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now come to the question of costs. First, the costs below. We set aside the order as to costs made at the conclusion of the trial. The plaintiffs abandoned their claim of passing off four months before the commencement of the trial, and they should bear the costs occasioned by this claim. We so order. Next, ABB`s claim was dismissed, and the question is whether in this case there should be an order against them for payment of any costs as a result of such dismissal. We think not. The dismissal of ABB`s claim was consequent on the finding that Hunter are the proprietors of the design. There was no separate issue raised as a result of ABB being joined as the co-plaintiff of Hunter, and their joinder did not result in any additional costs to Soundtex in pursuing their defence or counterclaim against Hunter. In the circumstances, we make no order as to costs against ABB. Subject to the order as to costs occasioned by the abandonment of the claim of passing off, we order Soundtex to pay Hunter the costs of the claim and counterclaim.<br/><br/>Next, we turn to the costs of the appeals. Although Hunter and ABB are the appellants in CA 80/99 and the respondents in CA 82/99, the real contest was between Hunter and Soundtex, and none of the orders we have made concerned ABB. We do not think it is appropriate to make an order as to costs in favour of ABB. We order Soundtex to pay Hunter the costs of the appeals. The deposit in court as security for costs in CA 80/99 is to be refunded to the appellants or their solicitors, and the deposit as security for costs in CA 82/99 be paid to Hunter or their solicitors to account of costs.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n    <p>Order accordingly.<br/><br/></p>\n

Kingdom and Holland to Singapore. Upon the arrival of the cargo in Singapore, the appellants were not able to deliver the cargo because of apparent disputes among the respondents as to who was entitled to it. The cargo was thus stranded at the godown of the Port of Singapore Authority (\u201cPSA\u201d) from April 2004 with substantial storage charges accumulating.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The appellants took out an interpleader summons to determine which of the respondents should be entitled to take delivery of the goods. The appellants also prayed for an order requiring the party, which was eventually adjudged to be entitled to the goods, to pay for the freight, demurrage, storage and other charges.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The summons came before Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J on 11\u00a0October 2004, who, having noted that substantial storage charges were mounting, made an interim order that pending the adjudication as to which of the respondents should be entitled to the cargo, the appellants pay up all outstanding storage charges due to the PSA. She also ordered that upon the sixth respondent, or any of the other respondents, furnishing security to the appellants covering freight, demurrage (in respect of 19 containers owned by the appellants) and PSA storage charges, the appellants were to release the cargo to the sixth respondent (or whoever provided the security) and the cargo was to be warehoused at 24\u00a0Jurong Port Road, Singapore 619097, to await the court\u2019s determination of the respondents\u2019 opposing claims to the cargo. A condition was imposed that if, by 20\u00a0October 2004 (extended to 9\u00a0November 2004 at the hearing of further arguments on 26\u00a0October 2004), none of the respondents had come forward to furnish the security, the appellants could dispose of the cargo and the proceeds were to be deposited into court. For the purposes of the hearing of the substantive interpleader summons, Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J ordered that the fourth and fifth respondents would be the plaintiffs and the others, the defendants.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The first and second respondents were the owners of the goods. The third respondent was the agent of the sixth respondent who had, pursuant to an agreement entered into with the first and second respondents in December 2003, agreed to purchase the goods at a price of US$2.5m. The goods were then in Europe. Under the purchase agreement, the sixth respondent was to arrange for the transportation of the goods to Singapore. The third respondent appointed the fifth respondent to make the necessary arrangements to transport the goods from Europe. As the fifth respondent was located in Singapore, it, in turn, appointed the fourth respondent to handle the physical shipment of the goods from Europe to Singapore. In the bills of lading (\u201cB/L\u201d), the fourth respondent was named the shipper, and the fifth respondent, the consignee of the cargo.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The appellants objected to the order requiring them to pay the outstanding storage charges upfront to PSA in return for a security furnished by any of the respondents. They felt that the respondents should resolve the question of the storage charges directly with PSA and that the appellants should not be made a financier to the respondents. They said it was too onerous and inequitable a burden to require them to pay the PSA charges upfront, which was, in fact, the responsibility of the respondents. This was the main contention that came before Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J at the hearing of further arguments. However, the judge was not persuaded to change her mind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It was against this aspect of the order that the appellants filed the present appeal. In the meantime, pursuant to further interlocutory applications, the order made by Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J was stayed pending the hearing of this appeal on an expedited basis. The appeal was heard on 25\u00a0November 2004 and was dismissed. The court also gave certain consequential orders. We now give our reasons for the dismissal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appellants\u2019 contention</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It is settled law that a carrier has a lien over a cargo in respect of freight and reasonably necessary storage charges. The appellants argued that the respondents, as the persons entitled to the cargo, should pay the storage charges directly (or through the appellants) to the PSA to obtain delivery of the cargo. The appellants averred that they should not be made to pay the storage charges on the respondents\u2019 behalf as they did not owe any duty to the respondents to make such a payment. The appellants claimed that they had completed their contractual obligations by discharging the cargo into the PSA godown, as is the standard procedure at the Singapore port. They contended that it was the respondents\u2019 dispute amongst themselves that had placed the appellants in a bind. The appellants accepted that until the cargo was delivered to the person lawfully entitled to it, they were under a duty only to take reasonable care of the cargo. Except for this, they argued that they owed no further obligations to the consignee or any other person who had an interest in the cargo. In this regard, the appellants relied upon <i>Booth Steamship Company, Limited v Cargo Fleet Iron Company, Limited</i> <nobr>[1916] 2 KB 570</nobr> to submit that, as each respondent had requested the appellants not to deliver the cargo to the other respondents, the respondents could only take delivery upon payment of storage charges to the PSA.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The appellants also argued that the order of 26\u00a0October 2004 was tantamount to the reallocation of rights and obligations of the parties in a manner inconsistent, not only with the law, but with the commercial realities of the matter, as such a reallocation of rights and obligations was not and could not have been within the contemplation of the parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Our decision</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It is not in dispute that a shipowner has a lien over a cargo for freight due in respect of the carriage of that cargo and all charges necessarily and properly incurred by him in discharging and warehousing the same: see <i>Harley v Gardner</i> (1932) 43\u00a0Ll L Rep 104.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In an ordinary case, upon the cargo being discharged into a PSA godown, the consignee would collect the goods after paying freight and the PSA storage charges, if any. However, in this case, there was a dispute among the respondents as to who should be entitled to the cargo. As far as the appellants were concerned, they only wanted to recover the freight charges and demurrage which were due to them. They had no interest in the cargo. However, it seemed to us that the appellants were also concerned about the escalating storage charges at the PSA which were billed by the PSA to them. If eventually no party should come forward to pay the storage charges and freight and take the cargo away, the appellants would have to pay the PSA. Whether in that event the appellants would have recourse against any other party is a separate matter altogether.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It is clear that the party, among the respondents, who is ultimately adjudged to be entitled to the cargo, will be required to pay the freight and all charges (including storage), which were reasonably incurred in relation to the cargo, before the cargo can be released to him. Not only is that the position under the common law, it was expressly so provided in the contract of carriage. Clause\u00a017 of the B/L provided:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Carrier shall have a lien on the Goods and any documents relating thereto for all sums payable to the Carrier under this contract and for general average contributions to whomsoever due. The Carrier shall also have a lien against the Merchant on the Goods and any document relating thereto for all sums due from him to the Carrier under any other contract. The Carrier may exercise his lien at any time and any place in his sole discretion, whether the contractual Carriage is completed or not. In any event any lien shall extend to cover the cost of recovering any sums due and for that purpose the Carrier shall have the right to sell the Goods by public auction or private treaty, without notice to the Merchant. The Carrier\u2019s lien shall survive delivery of the Goods.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Clause\u00a022.2 of the B/L provided that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Merchant shall take delivery of the Goods within the time provided for in the Carrier\u2019s applicable Tariff. If the Merchant fails to do so, the Carrier may without notice unpack the Goods if packed in containers and/or store the Goods ashore, afloat, in the open or under cover at the sole risk of the Merchant. Such storage shall constitute due delivery hereunder and thereupon all liability shall cease and the costs of such storage shall forthwith upon demand be paid by the Merchant to the Carrier.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> We should mention that the appellants had also referred to Part\u00a0VII of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap\u00a0179, 1996\u00a0Rev Ed) which sets out a framework within which a shipowner, who has a lien over cargo for unpaid freight or other charges, may land the cargo and obtain payment of the same. However, while there is controversy as to whether the present case falls within Part\u00a0VII of the Act, we need not have to go into this question at this juncture.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> We appreciate that the appellants instituted these proceedings primarily to have the court resolve the conflicting claims of the respondents to the cargo. However, it is vital to bear in mind that the order made by Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J was clearly interim in nature, with the object of saving storage costs pending the resolution of the respondents\u2019 opposing claims. It would benefit neither the appellants, nor the person ultimately adjudicated to be entitled to the cargo, to let the cargo remain any longer in the PSA godown in view of the high storage rate. The order would have the effect of halting the bleeding because the value of the cargo would diminish significantly for every day that it remained at the PSA godown. As we have alluded to earlier, if the sale proceeds were insufficient to meet the PSA charges, the PSA would have to look to the appellants for the shortfall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It is understandable why the PSA\u2019s prescribed storage rates are high. The high storage rates are to discourage shipowners or consignees from leaving cargo at PSA premises for an inordinately long period because the space is required for the free flow of cargo traffic through the port.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The real question is: was the judge wrong to have made the order? In <i>BP Benzin und Petroleum AG v European-American Banking Corporation</i> [1978] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 364, Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR, in pronouncing on the court\u2019s jurisdiction in an interpleader proceeding, said at 366:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It seems to me under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, when an interpleader is taken out, the Court can make such order as it thinks just in the matter even though it does interfere with the rights of the parties if that is the just solution of the case. \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 I think the jurisdiction of the Court, whether put under the rules or under the inherent jurisdiction, is ample for the Court to do what is right and just.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It was also not in dispute that the appellants had acted reasonably in discharging the cargo into the PSA godown. That has been the standard practice at the Singapore port. There is a 72-hour grace period where no storage charge will be levied, so as to enable consignees to collect their goods.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Unfortunately, in this case the respondents could not agree among themselves as to who should take delivery of the cargo. From the dates the two vessels arrived in Singapore, <i>ie</i>, on 14 and 21\u00a0April 2004 respectively, up to the date the appellants made the interpleader application, the appellants had informed the consignee, the fifth respondents, of the accruing PSA storage charges. On the other hand, the appellants had also received notices from each of the respondents specifically instructing the appellants not to release the cargo to any of the other respondents. Notwithstanding this impasse, the third and sixth respondents contended that the appellants should have moved the cargo to a private commercial warehouse where the charges would be much lower. This will be a question which will have to be addressed at the substantive hearing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> We do not think that by making the order, Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J had in any way affixed the appellants with the ultimate liability to bear the PSA storage charges.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0</span> Neither had the judge by the order imposed a new obligation on the appellants. PSA had billed the appellants for the storage charges. The judge had not made an order that permanently affected the rights of the parties. She had merely, having regard to the circumstances of the case before her, thought it just and expedient that the appellants should first pay the storage charges. The positions of the respondents were not all the same. The first and second respondents alleged that under the sale and purchase agreement, title to the goods would only pass to the sixth respondent upon full payment and full payment had yet to be made. Neither were the first and second respondents shippers nor consignees of the cargo. Barring any reason otherwise, as a rule, the party who succeeds in showing that he is entitled to the delivery of the cargo, would have to pay the freight, the storage charges and all other costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the shipowner in relation to the cargo. Thus, to secure the interest of the appellants, the judge also expressly ordered that the respondent who wished to have the cargo delivered to him should furnish to the appellants the required security to cover both the freight and the storage charges paid by the appellants to the PSA.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> A case where the facts are quite close to the present is <i>Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd v Procter &amp; Gamble (Philippines) Inc</i> [1997] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 341 (\u201c<i>Hanjin Shipping</i>\u201d). There, the shipowner interpleaded in relation to the claims of the sellers of the goods, the buyers of the goods and the shipping agents. Faced with conflicting claims, the shipowner transferred the goods into bonded storage. The shipowner asked that the expenses which he had incurred be paid before he was required to release the goods. Longmore\u00a0J agreed with the averment. However, in <i>Hanjin Shipping</i>, at the time the matter came before Longmore\u00a0J, only the second and fourth defendants, who were acting in concert, came to stake their claims. There were no opposing claims to be adjudicated by the court. Thus, the cargo was released to them. In the circumstances in that case, there was no reason whatsoever for requiring the shipowner to pay up the storage charges first. Quite correctly, the two defendants were ordered to pay for the freight, storage and other charges before being allowed to collect the cargo.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> However, in our present case, not only is the substantive interpleader issue yet to be determined, two of the respondents have also challenged the appellants\u2019 actions in allowing the cargo to remain in the PSA godown, thus incurring such high storage charges. These are issues that require further scrutiny. We recognise that the difficulties that arose in this case were not of the appellants\u2019 doing. Nevertheless, the effect of the order of Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J was no more than to replace the form of the security for the appellants\u2019 claim, <i>ie</i>, instead of the cargo, a banker\u2019s guarantee for the requisite amount was to be furnished. In all the circumstances, it was an eminently reasonable order. As Prof Jeffrey Pinsler noted in his work, <i>Singapore Court Practice 2003</i> (LexisNexis, 2003) at 426, \u201cThe court\u2019s discretion is limited only by considerations of justice.\u201d We cannot accept the appellants\u2019 assertion that the order of the judge set a dangerous precedent. What would be a reasonable interim arrangement must depend on the circumstances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> There was only one minor adjustment which we made to the order of Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J. In determining the amount of the security, we thought the finance cost to the appellants for paying the PSA storage charges should be included. This, we fixed at 6% per annum over a period of 18 months from the date of the hearing of this appeal. That period should be sufficient to cover the time required for the trial and any appeal therefrom. This variation should adequately compensate for any loss which the appellant will suffer on account of their having to pay the PSA storage charges upfront.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Decision\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Appeal dismissed with slight variation to order below.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\F\\F\\ffd4eb84437b26995e5094b0a74c8bec\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"29564\" id=\"29564-M\" uniqueid=\"fdfb79ad-51c6-4569-93e8-a29e4117f12d\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/29564-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2004-04-20T13:59:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2004-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2004</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2004</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>16</No>\n      <NCit>[2004] SGCA 16</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2004</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>16</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2004] SGCA 16</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>The \"Melati\" (No 2)</CaseTitle><SortTitle>The \"Melati\" (No 2)</SortTitle><SortDate>2004-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA 134/2003, NM 16/2004, 21/2004</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#3\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Appellant</Role>\n        <Name>The \"Melati\" (No 2)</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#6\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Respondent</Role>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#7\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third Party</Role>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#68\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Chao Hick Tin JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#499\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Tan Lee Meng J</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#627\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Yong Pung How CJ</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Lim Tean and Probin Dass (Rajah and Tann) for appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Kenneth Lie and Chow Sy Hann (Joseph Tan Jude Benny) for respondent</Counsel>\n    </Counsels>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#786\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Civil Procedure</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#792\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Appeals</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"3\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#793\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Leave</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Judge in chambers allowing extension of time to file Statement of  Claim and allowing Statement of Claim filed out of time to stand</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Whether appellant required to obtain leave of court to appeal to Court of Appeal</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"6\">Section 34(2)(d) Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed)</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n  \n\n<SLR>YES</SLR></Metadata>\n</CaseReport>\n<body>\n    <p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">\n      <span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0April 2004</span>\n    </p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Author\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Chao Hick Tin\u00a0JA (delivering the judgment of the court):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two motions were before this court in relation to Civil Appeal No\u00a0134 of 2003. The first was by the respondent cargo owners seeking to strike out the appeal on the ground that the appellant shipowners had failed to obtain leave of court, as required under s\u00a034(2)(d) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d), before filing the notice of appeal against the decision of Belinda Ang Saw Ean\u00a0J (reported at <nobr>[2003] 4 SLR 575</nobr>). The arguments before us centred on the true nature of the orders made by Ang\u00a0J against which the appellants sought to appeal.

On 5\u00a0March 2002, the cargo owners, who suffered losses as a result of the casualty, took out a writ <i>in rem</i> against the shipowners. The <i>in rem</i> writ was served on 12\u00a0March 2002. Appearance was duly entered on 20\u00a0March 2002. Thereafter, the cargo owners took no further steps until 18\u00a0March 2003 when they filed and served a statement of claim out of time on the shipowners\u2019 solicitors.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under O\u00a018 r\u00a01 of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d), the statement of claim to a writ must be served on the defendant within 14 days of the defendant entering appearance unless the court allows otherwise.

Subsequently, exchanges took place between the solicitors of the parties as to whether the filing and service of the summons in chambers was proper and whether the action had been automatically discontinued. As no agreement could be reached, the cargo owners made an application by summons in chambers for the following reliefs:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The time for filing of the statement of claim in the action be extended;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A declaration that the statement of claim filed and served on the defendants on 18 March 2003 was regular and made in accordance with the Rules of Court;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further and alternatively, the plaintiffs be at liberty to reinstate the action herein.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24\u00a0April 2003, the assistant registrar dismissed the cargo owners\u2019 application and also ordered that the statement of claim filed on 18\u00a0March 2003 be \u201cstruck out\u201d. He felt that such a long extension of time to enable the statement of claim to be filed and served would \u201cquite fatally disrupt case management\u201d. He also refused to reinstate the action as the cargo owners did not prosecute it with due despatch.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The cargo owners appealed to the judge in chambers who, on 21\u00a0October 2003, allowed the appeal. She extended the time for the filing of the statement of claim and retrospectively validated the service of the statement of claim effected on 18\u00a0March 2003. She ordered that time ran from the date of her order for the shipowners to file their defence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 27\u00a0October 2003, as required under s\u00a034(1)(c) of the SCJA, the shipowners requested for a certification from the judge that she would require no further arguments on the matter. The judge duly so certified on 4\u00a0November 2003. On 20\u00a0November 2003, a notice of appeal was filed by the shipowners.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thereafter the parties proceeded in the normal way to discuss about the necessary documents to be included in the Record of Appeal. On 9\u00a0February 2004, the shipowners filed and served on the cargo owners the Appellant\u2019s Case, the Record of Appeal, the Core Bundle and the Bundle of Authorities. It was only eight days later, on 17\u00a0February 2004, that the cargo owners wrote to the shipowners alleging for the first time that as the latter had failed to obtain leave of court before filing their notice of appeal, there was, in fact, no appeal. The cargo owners contended that the failure to obtain such leave was fatal to the appeal. They said that without leave, there could be no appeal. Thus the notice of appeal should properly be withdrawn. This was the backdrop to the two motions before us.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Nature of the orders</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fundamental question, which would be determinative of the first motion, related to the true nature of the orders made by the judge. Did they amount to an order \u201crefusing to strike out an action or a pleading or a part of a pleading\u201d within the meaning of s\u00a034(2)(d) of the SCJA?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To answer that question, it would be expedient to bear in mind the reliefs sought by the cargo owners in their summons in chambers: see [5] above. Quite clearly, they wanted an extension of time to file and serve their statement of claim out of time. Further, and in the alternative, if due to inaction on their part for such a long period the case should fall within the ambit of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6), they beseeched this court, in exercise of its discretionary power under O\u00a021 r\u00a02(8), to reinstate the action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the application came before the assistant registrar, no arguments pertaining to the merits of the claim were made. The arguments centred squarely on the two main points, namely, whether the court should exercise its discretion to extend time to enable the cargo owners to file and serve the statement of claim out of time and whether, if automatic discontinuance had set in, to reinstate the action. It is true that the assistant registrar, in refusing the reliefs prayed for, also ordered that the statement of claim already filed be struck out. But it was clear that by so ordering, the assistant registrar did not mean to suggest that the statement of claim was struck out as having no merits or being an abuse of process. He meant to say that the statement of claim should not have been filed and it should not, therefore, remain on the record, or, in his words, he saw no point in leaving the statement of claim \u201cfloating around\u201d. Instead of saying that it was struck out, he could very well have said that the statement of claim be removed from the record.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, when the matter came on appeal to the judge in chambers, who, in such circumstances, exercised a confirmatory jurisdiction (see <i>Herbs and Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1990] SLR 1234</nobr> and <i>Lassiter Ann Masters v To Keng Lam</i> <nobr>[2004] SGCA 10</nobr>), she reheard the arguments of the parties in relation to the application made in the summons in chambers. Like the assistant registrar, she did not hear any arguments on the merits of the claim. But, unlike the assistant registrar, the judge came to the conclusion that although the statement of claim was filed and served out of time on 18\u00a0March 2003, this failure constituted only an irregularity. In any event, this filing and serving of the statement of claim was a step taken in the action and in view of this, O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) had not been activated as 20\u00a0March 2002 to 18\u00a0March 2003 was just short of one year. The judge then proceeded to consider the reasons advanced by the cargo owners as to why the statement of claim was not filed within the prescribed time. This was what she said in relation to the explanation offered (at [12] and [13]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Robinson explained that it was not unusual for parties to agree to solve the salvage claim before the main cargo claim. A protective writ was issued since the defendants [the shipowners] refused their request to extend suit time. The salvage claim took some time to resolve. The salvors had problems getting up their claim. \u2026. Eventually, the arbitration in London involving the bills of lading in this action was settled amongst the defendants as shipowners, salvors and the plaintiffs as cargo interests on 17 February 2003. \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The delay was the result of a decision to await the outcome of the salvors\u2019 arbitration, as the plaintiffs had wanted to quantify the indemnity sought by them in the present action. The decision to wait may not have been justified as the cargo claim in Singapore could still proceed without quantification of the claim for salvage indemnity. Right or wrong, that was the course adopted and the decision could not in the circumstances be viewed as a manifest intention not to advance the cargo claim or that the plaintiffs were sleeping on the case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the judge did not think that to regularise the statement of claim filed by extending time would cause any real prejudice to the shipowners, she accordingly granted the extension asked for. She felt that not to grant an extension of time here would be \u201ca drastic and disproportionate response in the circumstances of the particular breach and would give the [shipowners] an unjustified tactical advantage and windfall\u201d (at [18]). She also ordered that the statement of claim was to \u201cstand as served on 18\u00a0March 2003\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, what the judge below decided was that she would exercise her discretion in granting an extension of time for the cargo owners to file their statement of claim out of time, and, by virtue of this extension, the irregularity in the filing and serving of the statement of claim was put right.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the way in which the cargo owners perceived the orders of the judge was this. They said that the judge, by granting the extension of time to regularise the filing and service of the pleading, was in effect refusing to strike out the statement of claim. Therefore, the judge having refused to so strike out the statement of claim, had made a decision falling squarely within s\u00a034(2)(d) of the SCJA. It was not necessary that there must be a formal application to specifically strike out the statement of claim. The whole object of s\u00a034(2), which had other limbs too, of requiring leave of court, was to sieve out non-serious and unmeritorious appeals.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not in dispute that if leave was required and not obtained, then the notice of appeal would not be valid. This court had previously in <i>Rank Xerox (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Ultra Marketing Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 73</nobr> at 76, [10] ruled that a failure to obtain leave is a matter that goes to jurisdiction and is not something that can be waived by the parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Was there really a decision not to strike out?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Could it be said that the judge, in exercising her discretion to extend time to enable the cargo owners to file their statement of claim out of time and to allow the statement of claim already filed on 18\u00a0March 2003 to stand, had refused to strike out a statement of claim? The cargo owners urged this court to view the matter bearing in mind the orders made by the assistant registrar. In our opinion, this would be wrong. The orders made by the assistant registrar should have no bearing at all since they had been set aside by the judge in the exercise of her confirmatory jurisdiction. What was the nature or effect of the orders made by the judge should be apparent from the orders themselves. But, if the orders were at all unclear, reference should then be made to the prayers in the application concerned.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When so viewed, the nature of the orders made by the judge was quite clear. First, the judge extended the time within which the statement of claim should be filed by the cargo owners. Second, and in consequence of the first order, the judge allowed the statement of claim already filed on 18\u00a0March 2003 to remain. Of course, the judge could have declared that the statement of claim filed and served on 18\u00a0March 2003 was of no effect and directed that a fresh statement of claim be filed and served forthwith or within a reasonable time thereafter. If the judge had taken this course, there could be no argument whatsoever that it would not be a case of the judge refusing to strike out a statement of claim. Instead, being practical, the judge treated the earlier statement of claim as having been properly filed and served. We could not see why the adoption of this sensible approach should change the nature of the orders.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, we do not see how it could truly be asserted that the judge refused to strike out the statement of claim.\u00a0 It is true that s\u00a034(2)(d) of the SCJA does not elaborate on what would constitute or amount to a refusal to strike out a statement of claim. But this is addressed in O\u00a018 r\u00a019(1) of the ROC which provides that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that \u2014</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From this rule, it would be seen that the process of striking out is meant to be a simple and quick way of enabling a defendant to have a wholly unmeritorious claim be disposed of instead of having to waste time through a trial. Such a summary relief could be based on any of the grounds listed.\u00a0 It is trite law that the court will only make such an order in very clear cases because it would effectively deny the plaintiff or claimant his day in court. And if the judge should refuse the relief, it makes absolute sense that there should be no automatic right of appeal, as otherwise, a process which is intended to be short and simple will turn out to be long-drawn. Instead of a case coming up to the Court of Appeal once after trial, it could come up twice, rendering negative the very purpose of a quick solution. This is really the policy behind s\u00a034(2)(d) of the SCJA and O\u00a018 r\u00a019 of the ROC.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, Ang\u00a0J was not dealing with any arguments that the statement of claim should be struck out because it disclosed no reasonable cause of action or that it amounted to an abuse of process or the like.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, we held that the orders of Ang\u00a0J were not orders refusing to strike out a statement of claim. They were really interlocutory orders which would come under s\u00a034(1)(c) of the SCJA where an appeal could only be brought if the judge certifies, on an application made within seven days, that he or she requires no further arguments. In the present case, this condition was complied with by the shipowners. Accordingly, the appeal was properly brought.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\7\\B\\URJ_[2000]_SGCA_47_v1.0.html\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"3921\" id=\"3921-M\" uniqueid=\"f40ec2d2-e1a5-4f5b-838b-a56861933acf\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/3921-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2003-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2000-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2000</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2000</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>47</No>\n      <NCit>[2000] SGCA 47</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2000</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>47</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2000] SGCA 47</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>Zarkovic Stanko v Owners of the Ship or Vessel `MARA`</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Zarkovic Stanko v Owners of the Ship or Vessel `MARA`</SortTitle><SortDate>2000-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA 207/1999</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#3\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Appellant</Role>\n        <Name>Zarkovic Stanko</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#6\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Respondent</Role>\n        <Name>Owners of the Ship or Vessel `MARA`</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#7\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third Party</Role>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#68\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Chao Hick Tin JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#539\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L P Thean JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#627\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Yong Pung How CJ</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Belinda Ang SC and Goh Phai Cheng SC (Ang &amp; Partners) for the appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Jainil Bhandari and Kelly Yap (Rajah &amp; Tann) for the respondents.</Counsel>\n    </Counsels>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#34\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Admiralty and Shipping</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#35\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Admiralty jurisdiction and arrest</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Personal injury</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Fitter injured while working on board ship</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"6\">Claim for compensation under employment contract</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"7\">Whether court has jurisdiction</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"8\">s 3(1)(f) High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123)</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#1154\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Contract</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#1184\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Contractual terms</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Article 15 of International Transport Workers Federation collective agreement part of employment contract</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Ship owner paying fitter settlement sum for tort claim</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"6\">Whether fitter able to claim under employment contract in addition to settlement sum</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"7\">Whether this case an exception to rule against double recovery</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n  \n\n<SLR>YES</SLR></Metadata>\n</CaseReport>\n<body>\n    <p>(delivering the judgment of the court): This appeal raises two important questions of law. The first is whether the High Court has jurisdiction under s 3(1)(f) of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123) (`the Act`) to hear and determine the claim of the appellant for a sum of US$122,400 under the contract of employment made between him and his employer, the respondents, in respect of the personal injuries sustained by him in the course of his employment on board the respondents` ship, MARA (`the ship`). The second is whether the appellant having been paid a sum of US$420,000 plus costs pursuant to a settlement agreement made on 8 August 1998 under O 70 r 34 of the Rules of Court is entitled to recover the sum of US$122,400 under his contract of employment. In the court below, the learned judge held that the appellant`s claim for this sum under the employment contract does not fall within the provisions of s 3(1)(f) of the Act and therefore the court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim, and further that even if the claim falls within that section, the appellant would not be entitled to recover the sum on the ground that it would amount to double recovery. He accordingly dismissed the claim. Against his decision this appeal is now brought.<br/><br/><strong><i> The facts </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The appellant was employed as a fitter on the ship pursuant to a shipboard contract dated 1 July 1992 made between him and the respondents, which incorporated the terms of a collective agreement dated 16 July 1991 and made between the respondents and the International Transport Workers Federation (`collective agreement`). On 6 September 1992, the ship was anchored in the anchor area of Wielingen Noord near Vissingen in the Netherlands. On that morning, the appellant was instructed by the chief engineer and the first engineer to move the antenna of the satellite navigation system. In doing so, he needed some fastening clips which were stored in a workplace in the engine room. He accordingly took the ship`s internal elevator from the bridge deck for the purpose of going to the engine room. The elevator stopped at the landing, which was about 5 to 6 metres above the floor where the engine room was situated. On stepping out to the landing, he saw another seaman at work. While trying to assist that seaman, he was hit on his left shoulder from behind by an engine valve, which had come loose. He was pushed off the landing and fell onto the engine room below. Immediately following his fall, the engine valve weighing 1300 to 1350 kg rolled off the landing and fell onto him below.<br/><br/>As a result of the accident, the appellant suffered serious injuries and became permanently disabled. About three years later, he instituted an admiralty action in rem against the ship in the High Court, invoking the admiralty jurisdiction of the court, and claimed damages for the personal injuries sustained and the loss and expenses incurred by reason of the accident on board the MARA. In the statement of claim, as subsequently amended, the appellant by [para ] 7, 8 and 9 claimed as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>7 The plaintiff`s aforesaid pain and suffering, loss of amenities, injuries and expense were caused by the breach of duty and/or breach of the contract of employment and/or negligence of the defendants and/or their servants or agents, whom they are vicariously liable for, as particularised hereunder.   </p>\n        <p>Particulars  </p>\n        <p>...  </p>\n        <p>8 Further or in the alternative, the plaintiff`s aforesaid pain and suffering, loss of amenities, injuries and expense were caused by the breach of the defendants` duty, as occupier of the vessel, to the plaintiff who was on board the vessel pursuant to a contract made between the plaintiff and the defendants.  </p>\n        <p>Particulars  </p>\n        <p>...  </p>\n        <p>9 Further, it was a term of the contract of employment that the plaintiff would be paid compensation in the event of his suffering injury under art 15 of the collective agreement dated 16 July 1991. The compensation payable to the plaintiff in this regard amounts to US$122,400.00 plus interest and is without prejudice to such damages the plaintiff is entitled to claim at law.  </p>\n        <p>Particulars  </p>\n        <p>...</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The claim for the sum of US$122,400 with interest was founded on art 15 of the collective agreement which was incorporated into and was part of the terms of the employment contract. We shall refer to the terms of art 15 in detail in a moment.<br/><br/>The claim was initially resisted and a defence was filed and served by the respondents. In the defence, the issues on liability and quantum were joined. But no issue was raised as to the jurisdiction of the court. The action proceeded and affidavits of evidence-in-chief were filed by or on behalf of both parties. On 8 August 1998, which was shortly before the trial, the parties reached a settlement, which was embodied in a settlement agreement. That agreement was filed in court pursuant to O 70 r 34 of the Rules of Court, and in consequence under r 34 became an order of court and had the same effect as if it had been made by a judge. The agreement provided as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(a) Without any admission of liability, the defendants agree to pay the plaintiff the settlement sum comprising US$420,000 plus costs to be taxed if not agreed in full and final settlement of all the plaintiff`s claims in the re-amended statement of claim re-filed on 16 February 1998, save for the plaintiff`s claim for US$122,400 (or alternatively damages to be assessed) pursuant to paras 9 and 10 of the said re-amended statement of claim.  </p>\n        <p>(b) This agreement is strictly without prejudice to the defendant`s rights to challenge the plaintiff`s claim for US$122,400 (or alternatively damages to be assessed) pursuant to paras 9 and 10 of the said re-amended statement of claim, and the agreement to pay the settlement sum to the plaintiff in full and final settlement of all the plaintiff`s claims other than the plaintiff`s claim in paras 9 and 10 of the said re-amended statement of claim is not to be a waiver or diminution of the defendants` rights as such, which continue to remain expressly reserved.  </p>\n        <p>(c) Upon the defendants` payment to the plaintiff of the settlement sum, the parties agree to continue this action solely on the issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim for US$122,400 (or alternatively damages to be assessed) pursuant to paras 9 and 10 of the said re-amended atatement of claim (and if so, the quantum of such damages), notwithstanding that the defendants have paid or agreed to pay the settlement sum in full and final settlement of all the plaintiff`s claims in the re-amended statement of claim other than the plaintiff`s claim made under paras 9 and 10 of the said re-amended statement of claim.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We should mention that during the negotiations leading to the settlement agreement, the respondents` stand was that, as the appellant was legally entitled  to be paid contractual compensation under art 15, this amount ought to be deducted from the appellant`s claim for loss of future earnings. Their contention was that the appellant was not entitled to recover the sum of US$122,400 under art 15 or any sum, in addition to the US$420,000 received under the settlement agreement. The appellant, on the other hand, maintained that the sum under art 15 was in addition to any sum payable under the settlement agreement. This difference was not resolved, and the settlement was therefore expressly made without prejudice to the claim of US$122,400 which remained outstanding.<br/><br/>On 1 April 1999, the appellant took out an application by way of summons for further directions, seeking a determination of the following:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(i) Whether the plaintiff, having recovered US$420,000.00 plus costs under the agreement dated 8 August 1998, is entitled to claim compensation under art 15 of the applicable FIT/CISL collective agreement.  </p>\n        <p>(ii) On the basis that the annuity under the said art 15 is agreed at US$4,896.00 per annum.  </p>\n        <p>(a) Whether this annual annuity is payable to the plaintiff each year of his life and only ceases when the plaintiff dies, or is it payable from the date of the accident for the remainder of the plaintiff`s working life (ie up to retirement age).  </p>\n        <p>(b) Given that the contract of employment is subject to Maltese law and that Maltese retirement age is 60 years, what is the appropriate multiplier to be applied in the computation of the lump sum amount under art 15 of the collective agreement.  </p>\n        <p>(c) Whether the lump sum compensation payable under the said art 15 is subject to deduction for the accelerated payment received by the plaintiff.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The application was heard before the assistant registrar on 1 June 1999, who determined that the appellant was not precluded from bringing a claim under art 15 but held that there should not be double recovery in the quantification of damages and that the annuity is payable to the appellant from the date of the accident for the remainder of the appellant`s natural life. The appellant appealed to a judge-in-chambers.<br/><br/><strong><i> The decision below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before the learned judge, for the first time, the issue of jurisdiction of the court was raised. It is common ground that in bringing the claim the appellant invoked the admiralty jurisdiction of the court under s 3(1)(f) of the Act. The learned judge held that the court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the appellant`s claim for any sum under art 15. In reaching this conclusion, he relied on the English case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Moliere</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1925]  P 27</font>. In that case, the court held that the admiralty jurisdiction in respect of loss of life or personal injury was limited to a claim for damages arising by reason of a tort, and did not include a claim for statutory compensation payable irrespective of fault. Following the decision in that case, the learned judge held that, as the compensation under art 15 of the collective agreement is payable irrespective of fault, it is therefore outside the ambit of the court`s admiralty jurisdiction. His opinion is that any claim invoking the court`s admiralty jurisdiction under s 3(1)(f) of the Act must be based on fault.<br/><br/>The learned judge further held that if the appellant`s action is to be treated as a civil action, instead of an admiralty action, the appellant`s claim under art 15 would still be dismissed as the court would not allow double recovery. In his opinion, the following words in art 15, namely: `any payment effected under this clause shall be without prejudice to any claim for compensation made in law`, mean that the appellant is not shut out of the common law claim based on tort by reason of having received a contractual payment under art 15. If the appellant can show a larger claim in tort at common law, he can recover the difference between them, but not both in full.<br/><br/><strong><i> Jurisdiction </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We turn first to the issue of jurisdiction. The learned judge in deciding that the appellant`s claim does not come within s 3(1)(f) of the Act relied on the English case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Moliere</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1925]  P 27</font>. It is necessary to examine that case in some detail and the legislation governing the court`s admiralty jurisdiction then in force. In that case, a collision took place between a Swedish ship Adolf and a British ship The Moliere and it was decided by the Court of Appeal that both were equally to blame. As a result, cross-claims were brought by the respective parties and one of the claims that was brought by the owners of Adolf was the amount of compensation paid under Swedish law to the relatives of a seaman of Adolf, who was drowned as a result of the collision. The registrar reported on this claim and allowed it. The matter was then heard before Roche J. At that time, the statutes governing the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court of the United Kingdom were the Admiralty Court Acts of 1840 and 1861 and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, as extended by the Maritime Conventions Act 1911. Prior to the passing of the latter Act, the High Court did not have admiralty jurisdiction in rem over claims for loss of life and personal injury. Roche J in the course of his judgment said at pp 31-32:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Before the passing of the Maritime Conventions Act the position as to claims for loss of life or personal injury in relation to courts with admiralty jurisdiction was as follows: where such claims had to be enforced by action they were not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty as such, accordingly an action in rem will not lie to enforce them, and the Admiralty rules as to division of loss had no application in respect of them. See <strong> The Vera Cruz (No 2</strong>) (1884) 9 PD 96;  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Bernina</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1888] 13 App Cas 1</font>. An action in personam could of course be brought in the Admiralty Division to enforce such claims, subject to the same rules of law as would apply to them in a Court of common law. Where such claims gave no right of action, but a right to compensation subsisted or arose under some statute, British or foreign, it could not be contended that it was within the jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty to award compensation to a claimant.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The Maritime Conventions Act 1911 by ss 2, 3 and 5 extended in certain respects the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court. In so far as relevant, they provided as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>2 Where loss of life or personal injuries are suffered by any person on board a vessel owing to the fault of that vessel and of any other vessel or vessels, the liability of the owners of the vessels shall be joint and several:  </p>\n        <p>Provided ...   </p>\n        <p>3(1) Where loss of life or personal injuries are suffered by any person on board a vessel owing to the fault of that vessel and any other vessel or vessels, and a proportion of the damages is recovered against the owners of one of the vessels which exceeds the proportion in which she was in fault, they may recover by way of contribution the amount of the excess from the owners of the other vessel or vessels to the extent to which those vessels were respectively in fault:  </p>\n        <p>Provided ...  </p>\n        <p>4 ...  </p>\n        <p>5 Any enactment which confers on any court Admiralty jurisdiction in respect of damage shall have effect as though references to such damage included references to damages for loss of life or personal injury, and accordingly proceedings in respect of such damages may be brought in rem or in personam.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The effect of ss 2, 3 and 5 of the Maritime Conventions Act was that the admiralty court had in rem jurisdiction over claims for damages for loss of life and personal injuries suffered by persons on board the vessel owing to the fault of the vessel but not claims for compensation arising independently of fault. This limitation was clearly provided in ss 2 and 3. Under s 2, where the loss of life and personal injuries were suffered by any person on board a vessel `owing to the fault` of that vessel and of any other vessel or vessels, the liability of the owners of the vessels was to be joint and several, and s 3 provided for contribution from owners of the vessels. Section 5 extended the jurisdiction of the court to `damages for loss of life and personal injuries` which in turn referred to damages for loss of life and personal injuries as provided in ss 2 and 3. In view of these provisions, it is clear to us that to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction in rem, the claim for loss of life or personal injury had to be founded on the fault of the vessel or vessels in question, and a claim for compensation arising independently of fault was not a claim falling within ss 2, 3 and 5 of the Maritime Conventions Act.<br/><br/>Roche J, having considered, inter alia, ss 2, 3 and 5 of the Maritime Conventions Act and their impact on the admiralty jurisdiction of the court over claims for loss of life or personal injury, said at p 33:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It is to be observed that ss 2, 3 and 5 of the Act are concerned with damages and with actions therefor. No mention is made of compensation or of claims for compensation arising independently of fault in a shipowner, and no right of contribution or indemnity is conferred in respect of payments made by way of compensation. On any other view the silence of the contribution section (s 3) with regard to the case of an owner who may have to pay compensation, though his vessel is not in fault at all, would be quite inexplicable. The Maritime Conventions Act, therefore, in my opinion leaves the matter where it was before, and does not cover, or support, the claim now under consideration.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Our general observation on <strong><i> The Moliere </i></strong> is that the provisions of our High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act conferring in rem jurisdiction on our High Court are very much more extensive than those provided by the United Kingdom legislation in force at the time, when <strong><i> The Moliere </i></strong> was decided. Reverting to the case at hand, with the utmost respect to the learned judge, we do not find <strong><i> The Moliere </i></strong> of any assistance in the determination of the issue on jurisdiction under consideration.<br/><br/>It is now necessary to turn to the provisions of s 3(1)(f) of the Act which the appellant invokes in founding his claim. This section in so far as relevant is as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>3(1) The Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court shall be as follows, that is to say, jurisdiction to hear and determine any of the following questions or claims:...  </p>\n        <p>(f) any claim for loss of life or personal injury sustained in consequence of any defect in a ship or in her apparel or equipment, or of the wrongful act, neglect or default of the owners, charterers or persons in possession or control of a ship or of the master or crew thereof or of any person for whose wrongful acts, neglects or defaults the owners, charterers or persons in possession or control of a ship are responsible, being an act, neglect or default in the navigation or management of the ship, in the loading, carriage or discharge of goods on, in or from the ship or in the embarkation, carriage or disembarkation of persons on, in or from the ship.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The approach of the courts here and in the United Kingdom has been to give a broad and liberal construction to the statutory provisions conferring admiralty jurisdiction on the courts. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Antonis P Lemos; Samick Lines Co Ltd v Owners of the Antonis P Lemos</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1985]  AC 711</font>, the House of Lords held that a broad and liberal construction should be given to the provisions of the Supreme Court Act 1981 relating to the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court on the ground that the legislation was designed to give effect to an international convention. Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, who delivered the main speech of the House, said at pp 725-726:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Parker LJ, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal, accepted the proposition put forward by the respondents that, since the provisions of the Act of 1981 relating to the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court was designed to give domestic effect to an international convention, a broad and liberal construction should be given to them. There is ample authority to support this as a general proposition, to some of which Parker LJ referred in his judgment. I have no doubt that the proposition is, in general, correct, and that Parker LJ was right to accept it.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In that case, the sub-sub-charterer sued the head charterer in negligence for damage caused to its cargoes and invoked the admiralty jurisdiction of the court under s 20(2)(h) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (which is the equivalent of s 3(1)(h) of our High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act). The House of Lords construed the words `arising out of` to mean `connected with`, and held that the plaintiff`s claim, even though founded on tort, fell within s 20(2)(h) as a `claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use or hire of a ship`, because the claim was connected with an agreement relating to the carriage of goods in, or the use or hire of, a ship, namely, either the sub-charter or the sub-sub-charter, notwithstanding that the defendants were not a party to either agreement.<br/><br/>A similar approach was adopted by this court. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Trade Fair</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1994:3:827:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1994:3:827:\">  [1994] 3 SLR 827 </a>, the plaintiffs were engaged to discharge a cargo of soybean meal from the ship, The Trade Fair, and three of their employees, in the course of discharging the cargo from a deep tank, were overcome with hypoxia and subsequently died. The plaintiffs paid compensation in the sum of $135,000 under the Workmen`s Compensation Act (Cap 354) and thereafter instituted an action in rem against the  ship claiming an indemnity under s 18(b) of the Workmen`s Compensation Act. The claim was brought under s 3(1)(f) of the Act, as in this case. This court, following the approach in <strong><i> The Antonis P Lemos </i></strong>(supra), construed the words `any claim for loss of life or personal injury` in s 3(1)(f) of the Act to read `any claim arising out of loss of life or personal injury` and held that `any claim` would include a claim for compensation or a claim for indemnity in that case.<br/><br/>In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Alexander G Tsavliris &amp; Sons Maritime Co v Keppel Corp Ltd</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1995:2:113:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1995:2:113:\">  [1995] 2 SLR 113 </a>, the plaintiffs invoked the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court to enforce an arbitration award for remuneration for the services rendered by the plaintiff salvors to the Atlas Pride. The claim was made under s 3(1)(i) of the Act. This court following  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Saint Anna</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1983] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 637</font>, where Sheen J held that an arbitration award made pursuant to an agreement to refer to arbitration contained in a voyage charterparty could be enforced by an action in rem brought under s 20(2)(h) of the United Kingdom Supreme Court Act 1981 (which is the equivalent of s 3(1)(h) of our High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act), construed the words `in the nature of salvage` in s 3(1)(i) to mean `arising out of salvage`. Accordingly, the court held that the action to enforce the award was properly brought under s 3(1)(i) of the Act. Karthigesu JA, delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 119:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>If it is right that the words `<strong> in the nature of salvage</strong>` in s 3(1)(i) of the Act ought to be read as `<strong> arising out of salvage</strong>`, and in our judgment it is right, then applying the judgment in <strong> The Saint Anna</strong>, with which judgment we are in entire agreement, there is no doubt that this action which was brought to enforce the award is within the admiralty in rem jurisdiction and has been properly brought against the `Atlas Pride`. The agreement to refer to arbitration in London the assessment of the salvage reward or remuneration payable to the salvors <strong> arose out of</strong> the salvage of the `Atlas Pride` and the award of the arbitrator was the result of that reference.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Again, in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Indriani</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1996:1:305:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1996:1:305:\">  [1996] 1 SLR 305 </a>, this court, following the reasoning of the House of Lords in their decision in <strong><i> The Antonis P Lemos </i></strong> (supra), held that the phrase `arising out of` within s 3(1)(h) of the Act should be construed broadly and liberally to mean `connected with` rather than narrowly to mean `arising under`. This case is of particular significance in that a very broad and liberal construction was given to that section. There, the plaintiffs contracted to sell a certain cargo to an Indonesian company called Metro. The contract provided for, among other things, a `clean on board bill of lading` to be presented for payment by way of letter of credit. The plaintiffs chartered The Indriani from the defendants for the carriage of the cargo from China to Indonesia. By the terms of the charter party, the master was empowered to issue a `clean on board` bill of lading and had a right to reject any damaged cargo not in conformity with the description of the quality certificate of the official surveyor. The cargo was shipped on board and a clean bill was issued. However, when the cargo was discharged in Indonesia, it was found to be in a bad condition. The defendants wrote to Metro alleging that the cargo was `wet, warm and ill-smelling at the time of loading in China`. Metro rejected the cargo and refused to pay for it. The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants claiming damages in an amount representing the price of the cargo based on misrepresentation made by the defendants. The plaintiffs subsequently amended the claim to one for malicious or injurious falsehood. It was held by this court that the plaintiffs` claim  came within s 3(1)(h) of the Act, which covers `any claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use or hire of a ship`. This court, reiterating the approach adopted in the previous cases, said at pp 310-311:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The interpretation of the phrase `arising out of` adopted in <strong> The Antonis P Lemos</strong> was followed in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Maersk Nimrod</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1991] 3 All ER 161</font>, at p 171 and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Hamburg Star</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1994] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 339</font>, at p 406. In the light of the authorities, we agree with GP Selvam J that the phrase `arising out of` within s 3(1)(h) of the Act should be interpreted widely to mean `connected with`. In fact, the construction is in line with the recent decisions of this court in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Trade Fair; Owners of the Ship or Vessel Trade Fair v Lim &amp; Sons (Pte) Ltd</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1994:3:827:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1994:3:827:\">  [1994] 3 SLR 827 </a> and in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Alexander G Tsavliris &amp; Sons Maritime Co v Keppel Corp Ltd</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1995:2:113:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1995:2:113:\">  [1995] 2 SLR 113 </a>. In the former, `any claim for loss of life or personal injury` within s 3(1)(f) of the Act was interpreted widely to mean any claim arising out of loss of life or personal injury. In the latter, any claim `in the nature of salvage` within s 3(1)(i) of the Act was interpreted to mean any claim arising out of salvage. Both constructions aimed to give a wide and extensive effect to the admiralty jurisdiction conferred by the Act. In the premises, s 3(1)(h) is wide enough to include claims in tort. It is also immaterial whether the parties to an action are the parties to the agreement or agreements concerned.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>And later with reference to the claim under consideration the court said at p 311:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The tort of malicious or injurious falsehood protects the plaintiff`s interest in his property or trade, or economic interests generally. In the present case, the respondents seek to protect their interests in the cargo which was carried on board the Indriani pursuant to the charterparty, of which payment was to be made based on the clean bill of lading which the appellants issued. In this general sense, we find that a claim of this nature is not outside the ambit of the Act altogether.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Reverting to the case at hand, the learned judge after referring to <strong><i> The Moliere </i></strong>, expressed the view (at [para ] 8) that the admiralty jurisdiction in respect of personal injuries was limited to claims for damages, and that a claim for damages was a `term of art`. He then went on to say:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It means damages arising by reason of a tort and not statutory compensation payable irrespective of fault. <strong> A fortiori</strong> compensation payable under a contract irrespective of fault would be outside the ambit of the admiralty jurisdiction of the court. The same reasoning applies to any claim under s 3(1)(f) of the Act. Jurisdiction under s 3(1)(f) of the Act must be based on fault as spelt out by the words of the Act. A statutory tort is created by the Act. Once the claim based on the statutory tort was settled the parties were out of court.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Later he said at [para ] 9:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Claims in contract, in other words, are outside an admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court. The plaintiff, accordingly, is out of court in respect of a claim for personal injury based on the collective agreement.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It seems to us that the learned judge was of the view that to found admiralty in rem jurisdiction under s 3(1)(f) of the Act, the claim for loss of life or personal injury must be based on `fault`. With respect, a careful reading of para (f) of s 3(1) of the Act does not appear to support this conclusion. It bears repeating here the material words in that section:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(f) any claim for loss of life or personal injury sustained in consequence of <strong><i> any defect in a ship or in her apparel or equipment, or of the wrongful act, neglect or default </i></strong> of the owners, charterers or persons in possession or control of a ship or ... [Emphasis is added.]</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In our opinion, the words `sustained in consequence of any defect in a ship or in her apparel or equipment, or of the wrongful act, neglect or default of the owners ...` qualify the `loss of life or personal injury`. On a plain reading of this part of para (f), there are two types or categories of `claim for loss of life or personal injury sustained` as envisaged in para (f): one is where such loss of life or personal injury is sustained <strong><i> in consequence of </i></strong> `any defect in a ship or in her apparel or equipment`; and the other is where the loss of life or personal injury is sustained <strong><i> in consequence of </i></strong> `the wrongful act, neglect or default of the owners, charterers or persons in possession or control of the ship or the master or crew thereof or of any other persons for whose wrongful acts, neglects or defaults the owners, charterers or persons in possession or control of the ship are responsible, being an act, neglect or default in the navigation or management of the ship, in the loading, carriage or discharge of goods on or from the ship or in the embarkation, carriage or of disembarkation of persons on, in or from the ship` The second type or category of claim is based on `fault`, as the causation of the loss of life or personal injury is the `wrongful act, neglect or default`. However, the first type or category is not necessarily so based; no `fault` may be present in the causation of loss of life or personal injury, the causation being `any defect in a ship, in her apparel or equipment`.<br/><br/>In coming to this conclusion, we are mindful of the decision of this court in <strong><i> The Trade Fair </i></strong> (supra), where Karthigesu JA, delivering the judgment of this court, said at p 831:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We have no doubt, just as the learned judicial commissioner had no doubt, that the words `any claim` are wide enough to include claims for compensation or indemnity where such claims for compensation or indemnity are founded on <strong> fault in one or other of the respects as enumerated in the section</strong>. [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>However, that case was argued and decided on the basis that fault was present. The cause of action in that case was one under s 18(b) of the Workmen`s Compensation Act, and that section applies where the injury was caused in circumstances creating liability on the part of the person causing the injury, and the issue whether fault is or is not a requisite or essential element for invoking s 3(1)(f) was not argued and considered. In other words, that action was premised on fault of the person causing the injury. Karthigesu JA, immediately after the above passage of the judgment, said at p 831:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Turning once again to s 18(b) of the Workmen`s Compensation Act and translating it to the facts of this case it is clear that the respondents are entitled to be indemnified since the compensation payable by the respondents to the relatives of the stevedores for their death `was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability` in the appellants.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The next question here is whether the claim under consideration is one for loss of life or personal injury as provided in s 3(1)(f) of the Act. In <strong><i> The Trade Fair </i></strong> (supra), the term `any claim <strong><i> for </i></strong> loss of life or personal injury` was construed to  mean a claim <strong><i> arising out of </i></strong> loss of life or personal injury. Karthigesu JA, delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 832:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>So also if we substituted `arising out of` for the word `for` in s 3(1)(f) of the Act it will read `<strong> any claim arising out of loss of life or personal injury</strong> ...` and, in our judgment, would make perfectly good sense. Construed in this way, it is clear that a claim for compensation or a claim for an indemnity therefor arising out of loss of life must fall within s 3(1)(f) of the Act. In our view, this interpretation also accords with the legislative intent behind the enactment of s 3 of the Act as manifested in the parliamentary speech of the minister referred to above.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In this case, following what was decided in <strong><i> The Trade Fair </i></strong>, we would construe the words `any claim for loss of life or personal injury` to mean `any claim arising out of loss of life or personal injury`. No doubt, the present claim of the appellant is based on art 15 and is a contractual claim. However, it is a claim arising out of the personal injuries sustained by the appellant in consequence of either (i) a defect in the MARA or in her apparel or equipment, or (ii) the wrongful act, neglect or default of a person or persons, for whose wrongful act, neglect or default the respondents as owners of the MARA were responsible. In our judgment, such a claim falls within s 3(1)(f) of the Act. The appellant`s right to the payment under art 15 arose because he was injured by reason of an accident while working on board the respondents` ship.<br/><br/>It is necessary to refer briefly to the matters alleged in the affidavit of evidence filed by or on behalf of the appellant. He alleged that he sustained his injury because the valve was not properly secured due to the improper construction of the valve seat which did not support the greater part of the valve. Further, he also alleged that the accident was caused by the unsafe manner of working of his colleagues, in that the only two studs holding the valve were removed before the two steel slings had been fastened to the valve, thus leaving the valve standing loose. Mr Chay Choon Chong, a marine engineer, also gave evidence in his affidavit that the accident was due to unsafe work practices on board the ship.<br/><br/>Essentially, the appellant`s case was that his personal injuries were caused by a defect in the ship or in the equipment of the ship as well as the wrongful act, neglect or default of those persons for whom the owners were responsible, being an act, neglect or default in the management of the ship. Such injuries give rise to the claim under art 15 which falls within s 3(1)(f) of the Act, as the claim arose out of his personal injuries sustained as a consequence of one or more of the events covered in s 3(1)(f). The section covers `any claim`, and it does not matter whether the claim is in the nature of damages or indemnity or compensation or even a contractual claim. What matters is that the claim should arise out of loss of life or personal injury and that the loss of life or personal injury is occasioned by one or more of the causes enumerated in s 3(1)(f). On the facts of the present case, the appellant`s claim under art 15 is a claim arising out of personal injury sustained in consequence of a defect in the ship or in the equipment of the ship or in consequence of the wrongful act, neglect or default of those persons for whom the respondents as owners of the ship are responsible, being an act, neglect or default in the management of the ship. In our judgment, the appellant`s claim comes within the Court`s admiralty jurisdiction under s 3(1)(f) of the Act.<br/><br/><strong><i> Double recovery </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The next issue is whether the appellant is entitled to recover the amount of US$142,000 as compensation under art 15 in addition to the US$420,000 he had received in the settlement. The basic rule is that damages in negligence are purely compensatory, and in assessing damages for the loss the injured plaintiff has sustained, any gain which is received by him, which he would not have but for the injury, prima facie will be taken into account. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hussain v New Taplow Paper Mills Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1988]  AC 514</font>, 527, Lord Bridge of Harwich said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[P]rima facie the only recoverable loss is the net loss. Financial gains accruing to the plaintiff which he would not have received but for the event which constitutes the plaintiff`s cause of action are prima facie to be taken into account in mitigation of losses which that event occasions to him.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In that case, the plaintiff, who was employed by the defendants as a machine operator, was seriously injured in the course of his employment and was incapacitated from work. He was off from work until the trial but his contract of employment continued. Under the terms of the contract, he was entitled to and was paid full wages for 13 weeks and thereafter 50% of his pre-accident earnings as long-term sickness benefit so long as he remained in employment. These payments were made pursuant to an insurance scheme effected by the defendants. The trial judge held that these payments should be disregarded in assessing damages for loss of earnings, but the court of appeal held that they should be taken into account in reduction of damages. On appeal, the House of Lords agreed with the Court of Appeal. Lord Bridge of Harwich, who delivered the main speech of the House, said at p 530:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The question whether the scheme payments are or are not deductible in assessing damages for loss of earnings must be answered in the same way whether, after the first 13 weeks of incapacity, the payments fall to be made for a few weeks or for the rest of an employee`s working life. Looking at the payments made under the scheme by the defendants in the first weeks after the expiry of the period of 13 weeks of continuous incapacity, they seem to me indistinguishable in character from the sick pay which the employee receives during the first 13 weeks. They are payable under a term of the employee`s contract by the defendants to the employee qua employee as a partial substitute for earnings and are the very antithesis of a pension, which is payable only after employment ceases. The fact that the defendants happen to have insured their liability to meet these contractual commitments as they arise cannot affect the issue in any way.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>There are two established exceptions to the basic rule against double recovery. The first is where a plaintiff recovers any moneys under an insurance policy for which he has paid the premiums, and the insurance moneys are not deductible from damages payable by the tortfeasor:  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Bradburn v Great Western Rly Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1874]  LR 10 Exch 1</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1874-80]  All ER Rep 195</font>. The second is where the plaintiff receives money from the benevolence of third parties prompted by sympathy for his misfortune, as in the case of a beneficiary from a disaster fund, and the amount received is again to be disregarded:  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Redpath v Belfast and County Down Railway</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1947]  NI 167</font>. In Hussain (supra), Lord Bridge, having referred to these two exceptions, said at pp 527-528:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In both these cases there is in one sense double recovery. If the award of damages adequately compensates the plaintiff, as it should, the additional amounts received from the insurer or from third party benevolence may be regarded as a net gain to the plaintiff resulting from his injury. But in both cases the common sense of the exceptions stares one in the face. It may be summed up in the rhetorical question: `Why should the tortfeasor derive any benefit, in the one case, from the premiums which the plaintiff has paid to insure himself against some contingency, however caused, in the other case, from the money provided by the third party with the sole intention of benefiting the injured plaintiff?`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We have an observation on these two exceptions. The number of such exceptions is by no means closed, and there are circumstances where payments made to the injured plaintiffs do not fall precisely and squarely within either of the exceptions but are nonetheless not deductible in the assessment of recoverable loss. It should be borne in mind that the distinction between what is deductible and what is not is at times certainly not clear cut, and in between them are borderline cases which essentially turn on the special facts. In <strong><i> Hussain </i></strong> (supra), Lord Bridge said at p 528:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>There are, however, a variety of borderline situations where a plaintiff may receive money which, but for the wrong done to him by the defendant, he would not have received and where there may be no obvious answer to the question whether the rule against double recovery or some principle derived by analogy from one of the two classic exceptions to that rule should prevail ... Many eminent common law judges, I think it is fair to say, have been baffled by the problem of how to articulate a single guiding rule to distinguish receipts by a plaintiff which are to be taken into account in mitigation of damage from those which are not. Lord Reid aptly summed the matter up in <strong> Parry v Cleaver</strong> when he said [1970] AC 1, 13H: `The common law has treated this matter as one depending on justice, reasonableness and public policy.`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It is helpful to consider some of the borderline cases. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Payne v Railway Executive</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1952] 1 KB 26</font>, the plaintiff was at the material time in the service of the Royal Navy and while travelling by train was injured and as a result of his injuries became an invalid. He was discharged from service and was awarded a disability pension. In subsequent proceedings against the Railway Executive for damages for negligence, the question which arose was whether the disability pension could be taken into consideration in reduction of damages. Seller J was of the opinion that the plaintiff became entitled to the pension by reason of his naval service, it being one of the benefits such service afforded, and the pension would have been paid if the accident had been caused without any negligence on the part of the defendant`s servants. He therefore held that the pension must be disregarded in the assessment of damages just as insurance money would be disregarded, and that as a matter of principle the wrongdoer should not get the benefit of the fortuitous circumstances that the plaintiff was in the service of the navy and consequently received a pension. His decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. In particular, Cohen LJ, with whom Birkett LJ agreed, expressly approved (at pp 35-36) the conclusion and reasoning of Seller J.<br/><br/>In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Watson v Ramsay</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1961] 78 WN (NSW) 64</font>, the plaintiff was employed under the Public Service Act 1902 and upon retirement as a result of incapacity which was not due or attributable to any misconduct on his part became entitled to superannuation payments under a superannuation scheme. Both the plaintiff as the employee and his employers made contributions to the scheme. The question  which arose for consideration was whether such payments under the scheme were deductible in the assessment of damages for the injuries the plaintiff sustained as a result of the negligence of the defendant. Bereton J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales considered that the existence of such scheme as one of the incidents of the employment offered to the plaintiff which had the effect of making the terms of employment more attractive and of encouraging continuity of employment. In holding that the payments under the scheme should be disregarded, Bereton J said at p 65:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It may be that as a result of an accident this retirement is accelerated. The payment of the pension, therefore, begins earlier if the superannuation scheme so provides. But if it so does provide, this is no less a benefit earned by past work than a pension payable only at a specified age. A superannuation scheme of the type involved here is therefore to my mind completely analogous to a policy of accident or sickness insurance taken out in the employee`s favour with his employer instead of with an insurer. Whether paid by him wholly, or paid for partly by him and partly by his employer, it is none the less to my mind provided in consideration of his service to his employer; and where superannuation becomes payable before the normal retiring age, it is not payable in recognition of any injury which may have caused such retirement, or in order to alleviate any loss of earnings thereby occasioned, or as a discretionary payment or act of grace; it is payable simply and solely because the employee has by his work bought his entitlement to it; if it were not paid, and he sued for it, the fact that he had recovered damages for his injury from his employer or anyone else could not conceivably be pleaded in bar in that action.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>National Insurance Co of New Zealand Ltd v Espagne</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1961] 105 CLR 569</font>, the plaintiff, while a passenger in a car owned by one Archer and driven by one Brinskey, was seriously injured in a road traffic accident caused by the negligence of the latter. He brought an action against both of them to recover damages for the personal injuries sustained. Joined as a defendant also was the insurance company which was the substantive defendant in the suit. Among the injuries sustained by the plaintiff was permanent blindness, and as a result he qualified for and was granted an invalid pension by the authority concerned under the Social Services Act 1947-1957 in exercise of its administrative discretion. It was held by the High Court that the invalid pension was to be disregarded in the assessment of damages. Dixon CJ, in analysing the reasoning for the distinction between what is deductible and what is not, said at p 573:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The reasoning begins with a distinction which I think is clear enough in general conception. There are certain special services, aids, benefits, subventions and the like which in most communities are available to injured people. Simple examples are hospital and pharmaceutical benefits which lighten the monetary burden of illness. If the injured plaintiff has availed himself of these, he cannot establish or calculate his damages on the footing that he did not do so. On the other hand there may be advantages which accrue to the injured plaintiff, whether as a result of legislation or of contract or of benevolence, which have an additional characteristic. It may be true that they are conferred because he is intended to enjoy them in the events which have happened. Yet they have this distinguishing characteristic, namely they are conferred on him not only independently of the existence in him of a right of redress against others but so that they may be enjoyed by him although he may enforce that right: they are the product of a disposition in his favour intended for his enjoyment and not provided in relief of any liability in others fully to compensate him.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Windeyer J in a very detailed judgment, where he discussed and considered various authorities, said at pp 599-600:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Is there a governing principle in all these cases? So far as any rules can be extracted, I think that they may be stated, generally speaking, as follows: In assessing damages for personal injuries, benefits that a plaintiff has received or is to receive from any source other than the defendant are not to be regarded as mitigating his loss, if: (a) they were received or are to be received by him as a result of a contract he had made before the loss occurred and by the express or implied terms of that contract they were to be provided notwithstanding any rights of action he might have; or (b) they were given or promised to him by way of bounty, to the intent that he should enjoy them in addition to and not in diminution of any claim for damages. The first description covers accident insurances and also many forms of pensions and similar benefits provided by employers: in those cases it is immaterial that, by subrogation or otherwise, the contract may require a refund of moneys paid, or an adjustment of future benefits, to be made after the recovery of damages. The second description covers a variety of public charitable aid and some forms of relief given by the State as well as the produce of private benevolence. In both cases the decisive consideration is, not whether the benefit was received in consequence of, or as a result of the injury, but what was its character: and that is determined, in the one case by what under his contract the plaintiff had paid for, and in the other by the intent of the person conferring the benefit. The test is by purpose rather than by cause.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Graham v Baker</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1961] 106 CLR 340</font> is another decision of the High Court of Australia on the point under consideration. There, the plaintiff, who at the material time was a station officer in the employ of the Board of Fire Commissioners of New South Wales, was injured by the negligence of the defendant. Following the injuries, he was compulsorily retired whereupon he became entitled to a pension. This pension accrued to him as a result of his participation in a contributing superannuation scheme. It was held by the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court of Australia that no account should be taken of the pension payment accrued and paid to the plaintiff for the period between the date of the compulsory retirement and the date on which he would retire in the ordinary course of events.<br/><br/>In the leading case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Parry v Cleaver</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1970]  AC 1</font>, referred to by Lord Bridge in Hussain, a police constable while directing traffic was injured by the negligence of the defendant and as a result of the injuries had to be discharged from the police force. During the time of his employment, he was required under the Police Pension Regulations to contribute a certain amount from his wages to the pension fund, although no fund was maintained for his benefit. Upon his discharge from the service, he was paid a weekly ill-health or disablement pension. The main issue for consideration before the House of Lords was whether his ill-health or disablement pension was deductible in assessing the award of damages. It was held by a majority of three to two that such pension should not be taken into account and be deducted in the computation of damages. In particular, Lord Reid (at p 16) treated the pension as a form of insurance to which the plaintiff had contributed the premiums by his pre-accidental service. Lord Wilberforce (at p 42) considered that the pension was payable in any event and was not dependent on loss of earning capacity and that the pension was to be regarded as the reward  or earning of pre-injury service and therefore should not be taken into account in computing the post-injury wages.<br/><br/>Turning to the case at hand, counsel for the respondents contends that the payment under art 15 was in the nature of contractual compensation and should have been deducted from the damages for loss of earnings claimed by the appellant. As the appellant had recovered loss of earnings under the settlement without such deduction, he should not be allowed to recover the payment under art 15, as that would amount to double recovery. Counsel also contends that the burden is on the appellant to show that the payment under art 15 falls within either of the established exceptions to the prima facie rule against double recovery.<br/><br/>In support of his contention that the payment of art 15 is in the nature of a contractual compensation and not an insurance benefit or a benevolent gift, counsel for the respondents relies on the following factors. Firstly, the payment under art 15 is the appellant`s entitlement under his contract of employment and the nature of the payment is akin to sick or disability pay. Secondly, art 15 itself is headed `Compensation for Disability` and provides that the appellant shall receive an annual annuity if his ability to work is reduced as a result of the accident. Thirdly, the calculation of the annuity by reference to the appellant`s wages and degree of disability shows that the purpose of art 15 is to provide compensation for the appellant as a result of any disability occurring in the course of his employment.<br/><br/>Counsel for the appellant, on the other hand, relies on the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>McCamley v Cammell Laird Shipbuilders Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1990] 1 All ER 854</font> and contends that the payment under art 15 is in the nature of insurance benefits arranged by or through the respondents and also an act of benevolence on the respondents` part and should thus be excluded in the computation of damages for the tort for which the respondents are liable.<br/><br/>In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>McCamley v Cammell Laird Shipbuilders Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1990] 1 All ER 854</font>, the defendant employers took out a personal group insurance policy for the benefit of their employees, in which the employers were described as `the insured` and their employees as the `insured persons`. Payments under the insurance policy were made independently of fault and as a lump sum, not in substitution for loss of wages. The plaintiff was seriously injured in the course of his employment by the defendants and received a substantial sum under the terms of the insurance policy. The Court of Appeal held that the insurance payment was not to be deducted from the compensation claim in respect of his injuries, on the ground that such payment was an act of benevolence. The sum payable was quantified in advance of an accident taking place and it could not have been foreseen what damages might be sustained. Thus the payment made to the plaintiff under the policy did not fall within the normal rule that there should be no double recovery and the proceeds of the policy were not deductible from the damages awarded to the plaintiff.<br/><br/>Likewise, counsel for the appellant contends that the payment under art 15 is in the nature of an insurance benefit and also represents an act of benevolence on the part of the respondents. Counsel submits that the intent and purpose of art 15 is not to compensate him for any pain and suffering, loss of amenities and loss of earnings but to provide financial security in the form of an annual annuity for the  remainder of his natural life. It is an insurance benefit arranged by or through the respondents as the employers at the insistence of the appellant`s trade union and it forms part of the appellant`s remuneration as a benefit in kind. Under the appellant`s employment contract, the respondents were obliged to provide such an insurance benefit. Thus, following <strong><i> McCamley </i></strong>`s case, the appellant should be allowed to claim payment under art 15 in addition to the US$420,000 he had received under the settlement agreement.<br/><br/>In our view, there is a material distinction between the present case and <strong><i> McCamley </i></strong>. There, the policy was taken out by the employers on their own for the benefit of their employees and not pursuant to the contract of employment between them and their employees. In this case, however, art 15 is part of the terms of the contract of employment between the respondents and their employees, and by reason of this, the appellant is entitled to the payment under art 15 as a term of his employment contract and the respondents are legally obliged to pay it. That being so, it can hardly be contended that the payment is an act of benevolence on the respondents` part.<br/><br/>In considering the question whether the payment under art 15 should be brought into account in the assessment of damages, it is necessary to consider the nature of that payment. Lord Reid in <strong><i> Parry v Cleaver </i></strong> (supra) said at p 15:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Surely the distinction between receipts which must be brought into account and those which must not must depend not on their source but on their intrinsic nature.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In this connection, we now turn to art 15, which so far as material reads as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Compensation for Disability</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>A seafarer who suffers an accident whilst in the employment on the Vessel through no fault of his own, including accidents occurring whilst travelling to or from the Vessel at the request of the Owner/Management or their Agents, or as a result of marine peril and whose ability to work is reduced as a result thereof, shall receive from the Vessel, in addition to his sick pay, an annual annuity calculated on his basic pay at the rate given in the table below.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The annuity may be converted into a lump sum if the injured party so agrees.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>If agreement cannot be reached as to the degree of disability or the amount of lump sum, the matter shall be referred to a mutually acceptable third party whose findings shall be binding. If a third party cannot be agreed upon the Owner/Management or their Agents and the Unions shall retain full freedom of action.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <strong> Any payment effected under this clause shall be without prejudice to any claim for compensation made in law</strong>. [Emphasis is added]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The benefit under this clause is in the form of an annuity payable to a seafarer, who through no fault of his own, sustains personal injury in an accident while in the employment of the respondents on board the ship, and such annuity is calculated at certain rates. The seafarer is given a right to elect to convert the annuity into a lump sum payment. So long as the employee is not at fault in an accident, such benefit is payable irrespective of how it is caused. The annuity is payable for the remainder of the employee`s natural life and not merely for the remainder of his working life. For this reason, the purpose of the payment is not just to compensate the injured employee for his loss of earnings. Moreover, sick  or disability pay is provided elsewhere in the collective agreement, and the payment under art 15 is intended to be in addition to the sick pay that the employee would receive as a result of his injury. Also, the calculation of the annuity under art 15 is made by reference to the employee`s wages and degree of disability. It seems to us that the intent and purpose of art 15 is to provide the employee a kind of financial security in the form of an annuity for the rest of the employee`s natural life in the event that he suffers any disability as a result of an accident whilst in the employment of the ship through no fault of his. Broadly speaking, it is analogous to a benefit derived from an insurance scheme arranged by or through the respondents and it formed part of the employee`s remuneration as a benefit in kind. It is certainly analogous to the disability pension in <strong><i> Payne v Railway Executive </i></strong> (supra) or the invalid pension in <strong><i> National Insurance Co of New Zealand Ltd v Espagne </i></strong> (supra), which was held not to be deductible in the assessment of damages. In our opinion, the appellant is entitled to the payment under art 15 without having it deducted from the damages payable or paid under the settlement agreement in respect of his claim in tort.<br/><br/>Even if the payment is not a benefit arising strictly from an insurance scheme, we think that the appellant is still entitled to recover this contractual sum on the ground that the payment was expressly provided by his employment contract. In this connection, it is necessary to ascertain the intention of the parties at the time the agreement was made. It is trite law that the intention of the parties to a contract must be ascertained from the language they have used, considered in the light of the object or purpose of the contract and the surrounding circumstances. It should be noted that art 15 is part of the collective agreement entered into between the respondents and the trade union representing the crew members of the ship MARA, and it is quite apparent that it was intended to confer certain additional benefits to the crew members. It is also apparent to us that art 15 was drafted with the knowledge that a crew member who is injured through no fault of his own can also recover damages from a tortfeasor, and hence it expressly provides that any payment made under that artis without prejudice to any claim by the injured crew member against the tortfeasor. To our mind, the intent of art 15 is to provide the appellant a payment as an employee of the respondents which would not be affected by any claim for damages in law. In the words of Dixon CJ in <strong><i> National Insurance Co of New Ltd v Espagne </i></strong> (supra) at p 573, such payment is `both independent of and cumulative upon whatever right of redress against others might arise out of the circumstances of the accident`.<br/><br/>For the reasons given, it seems to us that both the appellant and the respondents had intended that the payment under art 15 is to be made over and above any damages or compensation that the appellant may recover. If the respondents had contracted on such a basis, as we think they had, there is no reason why they should be allowed to resile from their contractual obligation. There is no rule of law precluding an employer from making or agreeing to make a payment to his employee over and above what is recoverable by the latter as damages or compensation for any injury suffered by him.<br/><br/><strong><i> Conclusion </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the reasons given, we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the learned judge. We vary the order made by the assistant registrar by deleting [para ] 1(i) thereof and substituting for it an order that the appellant, having received the sum of US$420,0000, is entitled to the payment under art 15. The appellant is awarded costs here and before the learned judge. The deposit in court, with interest, if any, is to be refunded to the appellant or his solicitors.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a

ruling that the appellant, Salcon Limited (\u201cSalcon\u201d), a construction company, was liable to the respondent, United Cement Pte Ltd (\u201cUCL\u201d), for certain heads of consequential losses resulting from the former\u2019s negligence and breach of contract regarding the construction of a cement silo.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The facts in this case, shorn of details, are as follows. UCL, a Singapore company in the cement business, wanted to build a reinforced concrete silo (\u201cthe silo\u201d) at Pulau Damar Laut to store cement that was to be packed for sale. On 18\u00a0August 1993, UCL appointed Cheang Jen Boon (\u201cCheang\u201d), a professional engineer, to design the silo, which comprised seven cells within two concentric cylindrical walls, with the central cell (\u201cCell\u00a01\u201d) surrounded by six smaller cells (\u201cCells\u00a02 to 7\u201d) of varying sizes. Cheang\u2019s task was also to supervise the construction of the silo.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 16\u00a0November 1994, UCL appointed Salcon as the main contractor for the construction of the silo for a sum of $7,796,123.22. By December 1995, the construction work was substantially completed and by March 1996, the silo was fully operational.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The silo was neither well designed nor well constructed. By March 1997, a number of defects appeared. After these defects were rectified, Cheang issued the Certificate of Completion of Work and the Defects Liability Certificate on 26\u00a0June 1997. However, UCL continued to face problems with the silo. Between November 1997 and February 1998, chunks of concrete and rebars were flushed through the discharge valves of Cell\u00a04, which had to be emptied for repairs. Cracks and spalling along the inner wall of the silo were also discovered.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 3\u00a0February 1999, a site inspection was carried out by officers from the Building Control Division in the presence of all the parties. After this inspection, Cheang advised in his evaluation report of 13\u00a0February 1999 that the silo should not be operated beyond 70% of its capacity. This meant that each of the cells was not to be loaded beyond 70% of its capacity. By then, UCL had appointed Mr\u00a0Tan Ee Ping of M/s Tan Ee Ping &amp; Partners (\u201cTEPP\u201d) as its consultant. In two reports dated 4\u00a0May 1999 and 17\u00a0May 1999, TEPP recommended that the silo be shut down for repairs to be carried out. The silo ceased operating by 7\u00a0June 1999.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although TEPP knew that Cheang had advised that the silo should not be operated beyond 70% of its capacity, orders were given for Cell\u00a04 to be loaded to full capacity on 24\u00a0June 1999 so that stresses could be monitored by strain gauges. Some 6,000 tons of cement were poured into Cell\u00a04. This resulted in Cell\u00a04 being filled up to 97% of its storage capacity. On the following day, while cement was being discharged from Cell\u00a04 between 3.30pm and 4.00pm, a large vertical crack appeared around Cells\u00a03 and 4, after which the whole silo collapsed. As a result, rectification work was no longer possible as the silo had to be demolished and entirely reconstructed. Reconstruction work has since been completed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UCL instituted proceedings in the High Court against Cheong and Salcon for negligence and/or breach of contract. UCL asserted that the silo was wholly defective, unfit for its purpose and/or unsafe. By an order made on 2\u00a0March 2000 pursuant to s\u00a022 of the Arbitration Act (Cap\u00a010, 1985\u00a0Rev Ed), the dispute was referred to a panel of three arbitrators. The arbitrators were Mr\u00a0C\u00a0R Rajah SC, Mr\u00a0Teh Hee Seang and Mr\u00a0Tan Chee Meng.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The arbitration proceedings</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cheang and Salcon did not seriously dispute UCL\u2019s right to damages for defective design and workmanship. However, they submitted that TEPP\u2019s negligent advice to load Cell\u00a04 to full capacity on 24\u00a0June 1999 was a <i>novus actus interveniens</i> that broke the chain of causation and that, as such, the damages payable by them should be based on the cost of rectifying the defects resulting from the design and construction of the silo before it collapsed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In their Interim Award I, the arbitrators found as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cheang was negligent and had breached his design and supervision contract with UCL.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Salcon was negligent and in breach of its construction contract with UCL.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 TEPP\u2019s advice to UCL to load Cell\u00a04 on 24\u00a0June 1999 to full capacity was a <i>novus actus interneniens</i> which broke the chain of causation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UCL was not guilty of contributory negligence or of a failure to mitigate its losses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both Cheang and Salcon were liable to UCL for \u201cdamages arising from their negligence and breach of contract for the design and construction deficiencies in the silo prior to 24\u00a0June 1999\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The liability of Cheang and Salcon was apportioned at 30% and 70% respectively.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In para\u00a0243 of their Interim Award\u00a0I, the arbitrators directed as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Cheang] and [Salcon] are jointly and severally liable to [UCL] in damages for the cost of rectification of all design and construction defects in the silo in its state prior to the loading of Cell\u00a04 on 24\u00a0June 1999 and consequential loss arising therefrom, in the proportion of 30% and 70% respectively, such damages and loss to be assessed at a separate hearing, if not agreed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Salcon and UCL appealed against the findings of the tribunal.

The present appeal arose because UCL also claimed for other losses that would have arisen during the notional period of repair after the silo\u2019s collapse. The term \u201cnotional\u201d is used because the contemplated rectification works necessitated by Cheang\u2019s defective design and Salcon\u2019s defective construction work could no longer be carried out after the collapse of the silo. As a question arose as to whether UCL was entitled in law to claim for losses during the notional repair period because the tribunal had found that the silo collapsed as a result of TEPP\u2019s <i>novus actus interveniens</i>, the parties jointly framed the following preliminary questions of law on 3\u00a0November 2003 for the arbitrator\u2019s decision:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Preliminary Question 1</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In addition to [Claims\u00a0A and B] \u2026, whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(C)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 consequential loss incurred during the rectification period \u2026 [\u201cClaim\u00a0C\u201d] and/or</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(D)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 consequential loss due to the loss of capacity of the silo so rectified \u2026 [\u201cClaim\u00a0D\u201d].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Preliminary Question 2</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In addition to [Claim\u00a0A] \u2026 and as an alternative to claim\u00a0(B), whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(E)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 consequential loss measured by discounted cash flow of the defective silo as compared to a sound silo (see Item No 23 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Statement of Claim) [\u201cClaim\u00a0E\u201d]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Preliminary Question 3</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In addition to [Claims\u00a0A and B] above, whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(F)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 consequential loss measured by the depreciated replacement cost to reinstate the silo (see Item No\u00a024 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Statement of Claim) [\u201cClaim\u00a0F\u201d]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The arbitrator made the following findings in his Interim Award II:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">i.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary Question 1 - CLAIM C:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">UCL is entitled to claim for consequential losses during the notional period of repairs;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">ii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary Question 1 - CLAIM D:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">UCL is not entitled to claim for consequential losses due to the loss of capacity of the silo so rectified.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">iii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary Question 2 - CLAIM E:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">UCL is entitled to be compensated for the diminution in value of the silo measured by the \u201cDiscounted Cash Flow\u201d method.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">iv.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary Question 3 - CLAIM F:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">UCL is entitled to be compensated for the diminution in value of the silo measured by the \u201cDepreciated Replacement\u201d Cost method.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Salcon appealed against the arbitrator\u2019s findings in relation to Claims\u00a0C, E and F.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main issue in this appeal by Salcon against the arbitrator\u2019s findings in relation to Claims\u00a0C, E and F concerns the effect of TEPP\u2019s negligent advice on 24\u00a0June 1999 to load Cell\u00a04 to full capacity, which was regarded by the arbitrators as a <i>novus actus interveniens</i> that broke the chain of causation. Salcon contended that as the <i>novus actus interveniens</i> caused the silo to collapse, it is not liable to UCL for any consequential loss during the period of notional repairs to the silo (Claim\u00a0C) or any hypothetical diminution in the value of the silo measured by the two methods of assessment of loss referred to in Claims E and F. In coming to his decision in favour of UCL\u2019s Claims\u00a0C, E and F, the arbitrator relied on two English authorities, <i>The Haversham Grange</i> <nobr>[1905] P 307</nobr> and <i>Baker v Willoughby</i> <nobr>[1970] AC 467</nobr>. If both cases are examined, it will be found that they do not lend any support to UCL\u2019s case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first case, <i>The Haversham Grange,</i> must be viewed in the context of a number of other shipping cases. To begin with, in <i>The Glenfinlas</i> <nobr>[1918] P 363</nobr>, the plaintiff\u2019s vessel was involved in a collision as a result of the negligence of the defendant\u2019s vessel. Before permanent repairs could be effected, the plaintiff\u2019s vessel sank after hitting a mine. Apart from the repair costs, the plaintiff also made a claim for consequential losses, namely damages for detention that would have resulted had the vessel been repaired. The registrar, who dismissed the claim for damages for detention during the notional period of repair, said that this purely consequential loss stood on a different footing from the cost of repairs to the plaintiff\u2019s chattel. In his view, the principle to be applied was <i>restitutio in integrum</i>, and the question of awarding damages for loss of time when there was no such loss did not arise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reasoning in <i>The Glenfinlas</i> was approved by the English Court of Appeal in <i>The York</i> <nobr>[1929] P 178</nobr>. In the latter case, the plaintiff\u2019s vessel, which was damaged in a collision by the defendant\u2019s vessel, was able to continue trading without being repaired as the damage did not render her unseaworthy. Before the repairs were effected, the plaintiff decided to sell the vessel. As such, when the vessel reached Antwerp, her engines, boilers and tanks were opened for the buyer\u2019s inspection. While the vessel was idle and awaiting inspection, the plaintiff took the opportunity to repair the collision damage. The plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages for the detention of the vessel during the period of repair was rejected. Scrutton\u00a0LJ explained at 184:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In this case there was no work which she would otherwise have done during the time, for the reason that by her contract of sale she had incapacitated herself from doing any work at the time; and that being so, it appears to me that the shipowner fails to prove that the wrong of laying the ship idle was the result of the collision. His ship was idle because of the contract of sale and purchase, and the work which had to be done under it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The facts in the above-mentioned shipping cases are very different from those in <i>The Haversham Grange.</i> In that case, the plaintiff\u2019s vessel was damaged during a collision with another vessel and was further damaged within a day in a subsequent collision with the defendant\u2019s vessel. Both the collisions rendered the plaintiff\u2019s vessel unseaworthy, which meant that she had to be repaired immediately. The repairs for the damage caused in both collisions were effected simultaneously and the damage caused by the defendant\u2019s vessel was repaired within the time required for repairing the damage caused in the first collision. The plaintiff agreed to share the responsibility for the first collision with the owners of the other ship involved in that collision. After paying half the costs of the dock dues and demurrage, the plaintiff claimed these amounts from the defendant. The English Court of Appeal accepted that the defendant had to share the cost of dock dues, which were part of the cost of repairs. However, in the case of consequential losses during the period of repair, namely demurrage, it was held that the first tortfeasor, and not the defendant, was liable for it. Collins\u00a0MR explained that as it turned out, the plaintiff\u2019s vessel was detained the whole time in dock by the repairs which had to be executed in consequence of the damage done by the first tortfeasor\u2019s vessel and although the repairs occasioned by the defendant\u2019s vessel were effected simultaneously, the plaintiff\u2019s ship was not detained an hour longer by reason of that fact. In view of this, the defendant was not liable for demurrage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The decision in <i>The Haversham Grange</i> cannot be applied to the present case. To begin with, in <i>The Haversham Grange,</i> the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s ship was actually repaired and the consequential loss, namely demurrage, was actually incurred by the plaintiff. However, in the present case, repairs to the cement silo could no longer be carried out because it collapsed as a result of a <i>novus actus interveniens</i>. If the shipping cases are of any assistance, the collapse of the silo may be compared to the sinking of a ship and the principle enunciated in <i>The Glenfinlas</i> would be more relevant when considering UCL\u2019s claim for consequential losses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to <i>Baker v Willoughby</i> <nobr>[1970] AC 467</nobr> (\u201c<i>Baker</i>\u201d), a personal injury case that was criticised but not overruled by the House of Lords in <i>Jobling v Associated Dairies Ltd</i> <nobr>[1982] AC 794</nobr> (\u201c<i>Jobling</i>\u201d). In <i>Baker</i>, the defendant motorist negligently injured the plaintiff\u2019s left leg. Subsequently, the plaintiff\u2019s left leg was hit by a bullet during an armed robbery at his work place. As a result of the second injury, the plaintiff\u2019s leg had to be amputated. The House of Lords held that the defendant motorist remained liable for the plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering after the shooting that led to the amputation. Their Lordships took pains to stress that if this was not the case, the plaintiff would be prejudiced as the armed robbers, who found him in an injured state, were only liable for any additional damage that resulted from the shooting itself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Baker</i> must now be viewed in the light of the subsequent decision of the House of Lords in <i>Jobling.</i> In <i>Jobling</i>, the plaintiff was injured at his workplace as a result of his defendant employer\u2019s negligence. After the injury and before the trial, it was discovered that the plaintiff\u2019s own medical problems with his back would have curtailed his working life in any event. The House of Lords held that the defendant was only liable for the pain, suffering and loss of earnings suffered by the plaintiff up to the time the plaintiff\u2019s own illness effectively overtook the effects of the injury at the workplace. The plaintiff\u2019s illness was regarded as part of the vicissitudes of life which ought to be taken into account to reduce the damages awarded to the plaintiff. In coming to this conclusion, the House of Lords cast doubt on its previous decision in <i>Baker.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Often enough, attempts have been made to reconcile <i>Baker</i> with <i>Jobling</i> on the basis that the supervening factor in the former case was a tort whereas the supervening event in the latter case arose from natural causes. This is far from satisfactory for as Prof\u00a0John Fleming rightly pointed out, the risk in <i>Baker</i> of being shot was at least as random as the chance of disease in <i>Jobling</i> and a claim against criminals is as forlorn as blaming fate for the disease: see \u201cProbabilistic Causation in Tort Law\u201d (1989) 68\u00a0Can Bar Rev 661 at 672.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We were invited to rule on whether <i>Baker</i> is applicable in Singapore in personal injury cases and if so, whether the effect of that decision may be extended to commercial disputes such as the present, as the arbitrator had done. In our view, whether <i>Baker</i> is applicable in Singapore in personal injury cases is a question that ought to be considered on another occasion when that question directly arises. What is clear for present purposes is that whether or not <i>Baker</i> is applicable in personal injury cases, its effect should not be extended to commercial disputes such as the one presently being discussed. After all, in <i>Jobling</i>, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce took pains to stress at 804 that the rationalisation of the decision in <i>Baker</i>, as to which he at least had doubts, \u201cneed and should not be applied to other cases\u201d, while Lord\u00a0Keith of Kinkel made it clear at 814 that the weakened <i>ratio decidendi</i> of <i>Baker</i> \u201cmust lead to the conclusion that in its full breadth it is not acceptable\u201d. It should also be noted that Lord Edmund-Davies said at 808\u2013809 that he could \u201cformulate no convincing juristic or logical principles supportive of the decision\u201d in <i>Baker</i> while Lord\u00a0Bridge of Harwich took the view at 821 that the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of <i>Baker</i> could not be sustained. Finally, Lord\u00a0Russell of Killowen declared at 811 that the reliance in <i>Baker</i> by Lord\u00a0Reid on a workman\u2019s compensation case for his conclusion was unsound and that the reasons given in <i>Baker</i> did not persuade him to take a further step to allow the workman in <i>Jobling</i> to claim with respect to the period when his own back problems made it impossible for him to work. In view of the aforesaid, the arbitrator erred when he relied on <i>Baker</i> in the context of a commercial dispute.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are of the view that the issue in the present appeal should be considered in the context of the legal effect of a <i>novus actus interveniens.</i> The relevant question in this case is whether the losses in respect of which UCL has made claims were caused by Salcon or by the <i>novus actus interveniens</i>, namely TEPP\u2019s order to load Cell\u00a04 to full capacity on 24\u00a0June 1999. That causation must be established before the question of quantification of damages arises is obvious. In <i>Carslogie Steamship Co Ld v Royal Norwegian Government</i> <nobr>[1952] AC 292</nobr> at 300<i>,</i> Viscount Jowitt explained:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[A]t the outset I think it is well to bear in mind the elementary principle that it is for the plaintiff in an action of damages to prove his case to the satisfaction of the court. He has to show affirmatively that damages under any particular head have resulted from the wrongful act of the defendant, before he can recover those damages.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the facts in the present case may be compared to those in <i>Beoco Ltd v Alfa Laval Co Ltd</i> [1994] 4\u00a0All ER 464 (\u201c<i>Beoco</i>\u201d), a decision of the English Court of Appeal. In that case, the first defendant installed a heat exchanger at the plaintiff\u2019s factory, which produced refined edible oils. Some 20 months after the installation, a leak, which resulted from a crack in the outer surface of the casing, was discovered in the heat exchanger. The plaintiff employed the second defendant to repair the crack. The repair work was not altogether successful and the heat exchanger failed a pressure test conducted by the plaintiff\u2019s engineers. Notwithstanding this, the plaintiff\u2019s engineers decided to put the whole system back into operation again before a proper inspection of the heat exchanger, which would have shown that it was still defective and that the crack was now even more extensive. It was the plaintiff\u2019s responsibility to arrange for such an inspection. Two months later, the defective heat exchanger exploded, causing damage to the plaintiff\u2019s plant and loss of production.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was responsible for the explosion which resulted from its decision to put an inadequately repaired heat exchanger into service. It further held that while the first defendant was liable for the cost of replacing the defective casing of the heat exchanger as well as the loss of production while it was actually being repaired, it was not liable for hypothetical damages for lost production for the additional period required to repair the defective heat exchanger if it had not exploded after having been put back in service. The reason for this was that such further repair work was not carried out and had been subsumed within the more extensive repairs required because of the explosion caused by the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reference may also be made to the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Carslogie Steamship Co Ld v Royal Norwegian Government</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>) (\u201c<i>Carslogie</i>\u201d). In that case, the defendant was responsible for a collision with the plaintiff\u2019s vessel. As permanent repairs were not immediately required, the vessel sailed again after some temporary repairs were effected. During the voyage, heavy weather damaged the vessel to such an extent as to render her unseaworthy. As a result, she had to be in dry dock in New York for repairs. Both the collision damage and the heavy weather damage were repaired concurrently. As 30 days were required for repairing the damage caused by heavy weather and only ten were required to repair the damage caused during the collision, it followed that the defendant did not cause the vessel to be detained any longer than was necessary to repair the damage caused by the heavy weather during the voyage. It was thus held by the House of Lords that the defendant was not liable for the ten days of detention that were allocated for repairs for the collision because these ten days were subsumed within the much lengthier period of time needed to repair the damage caused by heavy weather.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The situation in the present case is similar to that in <i>Beoco</i> and <i>Carslogie</i>. Before Salcon could complete the required repairs to the silo, there was an overloading of Cell\u00a04 on TEPP\u2019s orders. This <i>novus actus interveniens</i> necessitated the complete reconstruction of the silo itself. As legal effect must be given to a <i>novus actus inteveniens</i>, UCL\u2019s Claim\u00a0C, which concerns consequential losses during the period of notional repairs to the silo, did not rest on solid ground and should have been dismissed. The <i>amicus curiae</i>, Prof\u00a0Andrew Phang, rightly explained the position in para\u00a086 of his submissions as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[S]uch reconstruction necessarily encompasses and incorporates whatever repairs which were hitherto required, but which cannot now be effected and which have now, in fact, been subsumed within the much larger enterprise of reconstruction. And the cause of the need for such reconstruction was \u2026 the <i>novus actus interveniens</i> for which [TEPP] was responsible. In other words, the chain of causation insofar as the repairs (and resultant consequential loss flowing [therefrom]) are concerned had been broken by the <i>novus actus interveniens</i>. Hence, the appellant was \u2013 and is \u2013 no longer liable for the consequential loss flowing from the notional repairs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Claim\u00a0F will next be considered. UCL attempted through Claim\u00a0F to recover the diminution in the value of the cement silo, as measured by the depreciated replacement cost method. It is true that while the general measure of loss in situations such as the present is the cost of repairing the damaged chattel, there may be occasions where a diminution in market value may merit some compensation in addition to the cost of repairs. In <i>Payton v Brooks</i> <nobr>[1974] RTR 169</nobr> at 176, Roskill\u00a0LJ explained:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[W]here the evidence justifies a finding that there has been, on top of the cost of repairs, some diminution in market value \u2013 or, to put the point another way, justifies the conclusion that the loss to the plaintiff has not been fully compensated by the receipt of the cost of complete and adequate repairs, because of a resultant diminution in market value \u2013 I can see no reason why the plaintiff should be deprived of recovery under that head of damage also.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The facts in the present case do not warrant an award of damages for diminution in value for the simple reason that what UCL eventually had was not a repaired silo with a lower value due to defects but a totally new silo that had to be built because of the <i>novus actus interveniens.</i> UCL cannot be allowed to claim damages for the loss of value of a hypothetically repaired silo as that would result in compensating it for a loss that it has not suffered and will not suffer. Salcon thus succeeds in its appeal against the arbitrator\u2019s finding in relation to Claim\u00a0F.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for Claim\u00a0E, which concerns damages for the diminution in the value of the silo measured by the discounted cash flow method, we agree with Prof\u00a0Phang that in the circumstances of this case, \u201cthere is no legal impediment to allowing [this claim] to succeed in place of [Claim\u00a0B], provided that [UCL] is not put in a better position [than] it would have been had it recovered under [Claim\u00a0B] instead\u201d. However, as Salcon has already accepted liability for Claim\u00a0B and UCL cannot be put in a better position under Claim\u00a0E than under Claim\u00a0B, it would be an exercise in futility for the parties to continue to spend time arguing whether the discounted cash flow method adopted by UCL\u2019s accounting expert is a reasonable alternative as well as an accurate measure of the loss resulting from Salcon\u2019s negligence. That being the case, the arbitrator\u2019s finding that UCL may proceed with Claim\u00a0E has no practical significance and the parties ought to take no further steps with respect to this matter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Costs</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Salcon is entitled to the costs of the appeal.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It raised an issue concerning the\n\ninterpretation of s 35(1) of the Land Acquisition Act (Cap 152, 1985 ed) (\u2018the\n\nAct\u2019). We allowed the appeal and now give our reasons.</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Background</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent, Heng Long Investment Pte Ltd\n\n(\u2018Heng Long\u2019) owned three plots of adjoining land, namely, Lots 119-4, 119-5 and\n\n121-17, with frontages to Kovan Road and Upper Serangoon Road. The total land area of\n\nthese plots was 3,898.1 square metres.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By declaration No. 2134 made on 24 June 1996,\n\nwhich was published in the Government Gazette No. 32 on 28 June 1996, notice was given\n\npursuant to s 5 of the Act for the acquisition of all the three plots of land for a public\n\npurpose, namely for the Northeast MRT line and for comprehensive development.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to s 10 of the Act, an inquiry was held\n\non 2 August 1996 before the Collector of Land Revenue (\u2018the Collector\u2019), and\n\nHeng Long submitted a claim of $26,000,000 as compensation for the acquisition. This claim\n\nwas partly supported by a report by JLW Property Consultants Pte Ltd which valued the\n\nacquired land at $20,000,000 as at 1 January 1995. On 28 October 1996, the Collector\n\nawarded Heng Long an amount of $16,760,000 (for the land and buildings with vacant\n\npossession) as the market value of the acquired land at the relevant date.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heng Long appealed to the Appeals Board against\n\nthe Collector\u2019s award, claiming the sum of $20,000,000 as the market value of the\n\nacquired land. In addition, at the hearing before the Appeals Board, Heng Long also\n\nclaimed under s\u00a033(1)(e) of the Act a sum of $220,200 for stamp duty as an expense\n\nthey had incurred as a result of the compulsory acquisition. This claim for stamp duty was\n\nmade for the first time before the Appeals Board; it was not made at the inquiry before\n\nthe Collector.</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The decision of the Appeals Board</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Appeals Board rejected altogether the\n\nvaluation put forward by Heng Long\u2019s valuer and determined that the market value of\n\nthe acquired land was $15,647,610, which was lower than the Collector\u2019s award of\n\n$16,760,000. As for the claim for the stamp duty in the sum of $220,000, the Collector\n\nconceded that Heng Long was entitled to the claim. He therefore submitted before the\n\nAppeals Board that the total amount to which Heng Long was entitled was only $15,867,610,\n\ncomprising the market value of $15,647,610 of the acquired land as determined by the\n\nAppeals Board and the stamp duty of $220,000. However, by reason of s 35(1) of the Act,\n\nthe Appeals Board has no power to award as compensation a sum less than the amount awarded\n\nby the Collector, and accordingly the Appeals Board should award the sum of $16,760,000\n\n(which was the amount awarded by the Collector), the stamp duty of $220,000 being included\n\nin the award.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Appeals Board did not agree with the\n\nCollector\u2019s submission. The Appeals Board took the view that the market value of the\n\nland represented a head of the claim under s 33(1) of the Act. Although the amount awarded\n\nby the Collector for the market value of the acquired land was more than that determined\n\nby the Appeals Board, by reason of s 35(1) of the Act, the Appeals Board did not have the\n\npower to award a sum less than the amount awarded by the Collector for that particular\n\nhead of claim. As for the stamp duty of $220,000 claimed by Heng Long, it came under a\n\ndifferent head of claim, wholly different from that relating to market value. It was not\n\nincluded in the award made by the Collector. Therefore, to the amount of $16,760,000\n\nawarded by the Collector, there still had to be added the sum of $220,000, which formed a\n\nseparate head of claim, to make the total award. The Commissioner of the Appeals Board\n\nsaid:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">[W]hen this matter was heard by the Collector, she was dealing with\n\n  market value of the land \u2013 that is made abundantly clear in her grounds of award\n\n  which I summarized a moment ago. She determined the market value of the land and buildings\n\n  with vacant possession and gave an award of $16,760,000. No claim had been put forward to\n\n  her under Section 33(1)(e) as has been put forward before us. We understand and appreciate\n\n  what Mr Chin has said that at the end of the day there has to be one composite figure for\n\n  compensation. However in that one composite figure, there would be various matters,\n\n  various headings, as I have enumerated, and in this case, the appellant made a claim for\n\n  stamp duty expenses which the respondent concede the appellants are entitled to. So far as\n\n  market value is concerned, we have ruled after hearing the evidence, having heard all the\n\n  evidence, that the correct market value must be as put forward for the respondents, the\n\n  sum of $15,647,610, which is less than the market value as given by the Collector at\n\n  $16,760,000. Mr Chin for the respondent submits that in making the award, the sum of\n\n  $220,200, being stamp duties, which the respondent concedes the appellants are entitled\n\n  to, is absorbed into the Collector\u2019s award of $16,760,000. With respect, we cannot\n\n  agree with that. As I have sought to demonstrate, that relates purely to the market value\n\n  of the land. This other sum of $220,200 is another matter \u2013 wholly different from\n\n  that relating to market value. Because we do not have the power to reduce the award that\n\n  has already been made by the Collector which is more than the market value as we\n\n  determined it to be, there still has to be added the sum of $220,200 which forms a\n\n  separate head of claim to make the total award. In those circumstances, the award of this\n\n  Board will have to be what the Collector gave plus the sum of $220,200, making a total\n\n  award of --- what\u2019s the amount? $16,980,200. Am I right?</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, the Appeals Board awarded Heng Long\n\nthe sum of $16,980,000, comprising: (i) $16,760,000 as the market value of the land, and\n\n(ii) $220,000 as the stamp duty paid. The Collector appealed against this award.</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Preliminary issue</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under s 29(2) of the Act, an appeal from the\n\ndecision of the Appeals Board can only be brought to this Court on a question of law.\n\nBefore us, a preliminary issue was raised as to whether the issue raised under appeal was\n\none of law. Mr Eric Chin, counsel for the Collector, conceded that Heng Long was indeed\n\nentitled to claim as part of the compensation the amount of stamp duty it had paid.\n\nHowever, he submitted that whether the amount of stamp duty claimed ought to be included\n\nas part of the amount awarded turned on the interpretation of s 35(1) of the Act.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, Mr Alan Wong, counsel for Heng\n\nLong, contended that there was no question of law to be decided in this appeal and\n\ntherefore the appeal fell foul of s 29(2) of the Act and should necessarily be dismissed.\n\nMr Wong argued that the only issue in this appeal was whether the Appeals Board could add\n\nthe $220,000, representing stamp duty paid by Heng Long, to the amount awarded by the\n\nCollector and that this was a question of fact.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We agreed with Mr Chin that the issue in this\n\nappeal was one of statutory interpretation. It is settled law that questions as to the\n\ncorrect interpretation of statutory provisions are indeed questions of law. In our\n\njudgment, the Collector was entitled to bring this appeal under s 29(2) of the Act.</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The substantive points in this appeal</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issue raised turned on the true construction\n\nof s 35(1) of the Act which provides as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">35. --(1) Where the applicant has made a claim to compensation pursuant\n\n  to any notice under section 8, the amount awarded to him shall not exceed the amount so\n\n  claimed or be less than the amount awarded by the Collector under section 10.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The crucial issue revolved around how the phrase \u2018the amount\n\nawarded\u2019 in s 35(1) was to be interpreted \u2013 should it be construed to mean the\n\ntotal compensation awarded or should it relate to each of the six items or matters\n\nreferred to in s 33(1) of the Act?</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Chin submitted that under the Act, the\n\nCollector was obliged to make one composite award after considering, in so far as\n\nrelevant, each of the six matters falling within s 33(1) of the Act. The Collector was not\n\nobliged to give a breakdown of the amounts attributed to each of the six matters listed.\n\nThat being the case, Mr Chin argued that on the true construction of s 35(1) \u2018the\n\namount awarded\u2019 means the composite award and not any specific sum for each of the\n\nmatters listed in s 33(1).</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, Mr Chin\u2019s contention was that the\n\nAppeals Board was mistaken in taking the view that it had to apply s 35(1) to each of the\n\nsix matters set out in s\u00a033(1) as the \u2018heads of claim\u2019, as opposed to\n\napplying it to the composite award made. The \u2018amount awarded\u2019 under s 35(1) does\n\nnot mean the individual amount that may be attributed to each \u2018head of claim\u2019\n\nthat makes up the award but <i>the total composite award</i> made under s 10 of the Act.\n\nHis position was that under s 35(1), the Appeals Board was free to reduce or increase the\n\namounts attributed to the heads of claim under s 33(1), but the total composite amount\n\nawarded should not exceed the amount claimed or be less than the amount awarded by the\n\nCollector.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adopting this interpretation, Mr Chin argued\n\nthat, as the Appeals Board found that the market value of the acquired land was\n\n$15,647,610, which was an item referred to in s 33(1)(a) and that an expense in the sum of\n\n$220,000 was incurred as a result of the compulsory acquisition, which was an item falling\n\nwithin s 33(1)(e), the total composite figure for the award was therefore $15,867,610.\n\nHowever, by reason of s\u00a035(1) of the Act, the Appeals Board could not award an amount\n\nless than the amount awarded by the Collector. As a result, the Appeals Board should have\n\nordered the Collector\u2019s award of $16,760,000 to stand. Instead, the Appeals Board\n\ntook the view that, as it could not reduce the Collector\u2019s award of $16,760,000 as\n\nthe market value, it added to this amount a further sum of $220,000 for the stamp duty\n\nincurred, thus making a total award of $16,980,000.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Our decision</p></b>\n\n</i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn first to s 33(1) of the Act, which so\n\nfar as material provides:</i></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">33.\u2014(1) In determining the amount of compensation to be awarded\n\n  for land acquired under this Act, the Board shall, subject to subsections (2), (3) and\n\n  (4), take into consideration the following matters and no others:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(a) the market value \u2014</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">\u2026..</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(b) any increase in the value of any other land of the person\n\n    interested likely to accrue from the use to which the land acquired will be put;</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(c) the damage, if any, sustained by the person interested at the time\n\n    of the Collector\u2019s taking possession of the land by reason of severing that land from\n\n    his other land;</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(d) the damage, if any, sustained by the person interested at the time\n\n    of the Collector\u2019s taking possession of the land by reason of the acquisition\n\n    injuriously affecting his other property, whether movable or immovable, in any other\n\n    manner;</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(e) if, in consequence of the acquisition, he is compelled to change\n\n    his residence or place of business, the reasonable expenses, if any, incidental to that\n\n    change; and</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(f) if, in consequence of the acquisition, any reissue of title is\n\n    necessary, the fees or costs relating to survey, issue and registration of title, stamp\n\n    duty and such other costs or fees which may reasonably be incurred.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Clearly in determining the amount of compensation to be awarded, the\n\nAppeals Board is required by s 33(1) to take into consideration such of these matters\n\nenumerated in sub-s (1) as are relevant. Having considered such of the matters as are\n\nrelevant, the Appeals Board then proceeds to make an award of compensation. The amount the\n\nAppeals Board makes is one composite award. There is nothing in the Act which requires the\n\nBoard to make, or entitles the Board to make, a separate award for each of the matters (so\n\nfar as they are relevant) listed in s 33(1).</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined the amount of the award, the\n\nBoard then applies s 35(1) which is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">35. --(1) Where the applicant has made a claim to compensation pursuant\n\n  to any notice under section 8, <i>the amount awarded </i>to him shall not exceed the\n\n  amount so claimed or be less than <i>the amount awarded by the Collector</i> under section\n\n  10. [Emphasis is ours]</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">It is clear to us that the words \u2018amount awarded to him\u2019 in\n\nthe context of the subsection clearly means the amount awarded by the Appeals Board. Now,\n\nin this case, the amount awarded by the Appeals Board comprises two sums: (i) the sum of\n\n$15,647,610 as the market value of the land acquired, a matter falling within\n\ns\u00a033(1)(a), and (ii) the sum of $220,000 as the stamp duty incurred as a consequence\n\nof the compulsory acquisition, a matter falling within s 33(1)(e). The total of these two\n\ncomponents came to $15,867,610, and this total sum represented <i>the amount awarded </i>to\n\nHeng Long as compensation. Now, the amount awarded by the Collector under s 10 of the Act\n\nwas $16,760,00. As the amount awarded by the Appeals Board was less than <i>the amount\n\nawarded by the Collector</i>, s 35(1) of the Act applied and the Appeals Board was obliged\n\nunder that section to award an amount not less than the amount awarded by the Collector.\n\nIn other words, the Appeals Board was obliged to award the amount of $16,760,000 to Heng\n\nLong. For the purpose of s 35(1) the total composite amount awarded has to be looked at\n\nand not the various sums or components that make up the total. In our judgment, the\n\nAppeals Board was not entitled to treat, as the amount awarded, the amount of $16,760,000\n\nbeing the market value of the acquired land and then add to it the amount of $220,000 as\n\nthe stamp duty incurred, thereby awarding in total a sum of $16,980,000.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, we found the Indian authorities\n\ncited by Mr Chin to be highly persuasive and pertinent. The provisions of the Act,\n\nincluding s 35(1), are almost identical to the Indian equivalent, specifically the Indian\n\nLand Acquisition Act 1894 (\u2018the Indian Act\u2019). Section 35(1) of our Act is\n\nsubstantially the same as s 25 of the Indian Act. The interpretation of s 25 of the Indian\n\nAct has been dealt with in numerous Indian cases.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, in the case of <i>Bai Jadav and others v\n\nCollector of Broach</i> AIR 1926 Bombay 372, Macleod CJ said at p 372:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">We do not think then, that the Judge was in error in infringing the\n\n  rule under which the Court is not entitled to award as compensation to a claimant under\n\n  the Land Acquisition Act an amount less than the amount offered by the Collector. The\n\n  compensation\u2026..is to be determined after certain matters have been taken into\n\n  consideration by the Court and <b>the total compensation has to be looked to and not the\n\n  various items which make up that total</b>. [Emphasis is ours]</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some seven years later, the case of <i>Secretary\n\nof State v F.E. Dinshaw </i>AIR 1933 Sind 21 went before the courts. Rupchand AJC said at\n\np 24:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\u2026..it would appear that s 25 was <b>intended to refer to the whole\n\n  claim made by the claimant and the whole amount of compensation awarded to him</b>\u2026..,\n\n  and to empower the Judge to alter the award of the Land Acquisition Officer under any one\n\n  or more of the sub-heads by either decreasing and increasing the amount awarded, provided\n\n  he did not award less than the total amount awarded by that officer or more than the total\n\n  amount claimed before that officer by the claimant. [Emphasis is ours]</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rupchand AJC also referred to the case of <i>Gangadhara\n\nShastri v Deputy Collector of Madras</i> (1912) 14 IC 270, where the same principles\n\napplied \u2013 that the whole case and not merely the particular objection should be\n\nreferred to; therefore it is open to the judge to award a sum less than that awarded by\n\nthe Land Acquisition Officer in respect of some of the sub-items, provided of course that\n\nthe total amount which he awards to the claimant on all items is not less than that\n\noriginally awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next relevant case was <i>Secretary of State\n\nv Malik Amir Mohammad Khan</i> AIR 1935 Lahore 653. A very pertinent passage from the\n\njudgment of Din Mohammad J at p 655 reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">It is no doubt true that the award made by the Collector cannot be\n\n  reduced, but <b>this restriction is confined to the award on the whole and not to its\n\n  component parts</b>. There is nothing in s 25(1) which precludes the District Judge from\n\n  introducing variations in different items that make up the award so long as the total\n\n  amount is not reduced. We cannot import into the plain language of section 25(1)\n\n  restrictions which do not exist there and <b>the only reasonable construction that can be\n\n  placed on the language employed therein is that it is only the total compensation made by\n\n  the Collector that cannot be reduced</b>. [Emphasis is ours]</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally the court in the case of <i>Sardar Sujan\n\nSingh and others v Secretary of State </i>AIR 1936 Peshawar 217 confirmed that the\n\nDistrict Judge had the power and was entitled to add some item while reducing another from\n\nthe Collector\u2019s award with the result that the total award was <b><i>increased</i></b>.\n\nThe only limitation to the court\u2019s power was that it could not <i><b>decrease</b> </i>the\n\nCollector\u2019s total award.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Conclusion</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our judgment, the expression the \u2018amount\n\nawarded\u2019 refers to a composite award made by the Appeals Board and the Collector\n\nrespectively and not to each separate head of claim under s 33(1). The Act clearly\n\nenvisages the award of a composite figure, as opposed to an individual award for each head\n\nof claim.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our judgment, the Appeals Board, having\n\ndetermined that the market value of the acquired land was $15,647,610, should have added\n\nto it the sum of $220,000, representing the stamp duty, thus making one composite award of\n\n$15,867,610. As this amount was less than the Collector\u2019s award of $16,760,000, the\n\nAppeals Board, as required under s 35(1) of the Act, should have awarded to Heng Long the\n\nsum of $16,760,000.

Technology Agency (\u201cthe respondent\u201d). Her judgment is reported in <i>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 720</nobr> (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d). At the end of the hearing, we unanimously dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from the substantive rights and liabilities of the parties, which must surely form the primary focus of any judicial decision, this case was also about an intensely practical problem in the law of negligence: How does one ascertain whether a duty of care exists in law between one person and another where there is no pre-existing contractual or legal relationship between them? The common law is rudderless and surprisingly fraught with difficulties and uncertainties in relation to this deceptively simple and yet important question. The courts in Singapore are no less spared from this problem which we will now address. We turn first to the facts of the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Background facts</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Award of the contract for the project</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant\u2019s claim stemmed from a dispute relating to the building project known as \u201cThe Proposed Redevelopment of Medical Camp in Nee Soon Camp Lot 212 PT MK 13 at Transit Road \u2013 Project LE(D) 1068 C08 MINDEF/DSTA\u201d (\u201cthe Project\u201d). As its name suggests, the Project was to redevelop a medical facility at Nee Soon Army Camp for the Ministry of Defence (\u201cMindef\u201d). The Government of Singapore (\u201cthe Employer\u201d) put the Project out for tender to which the appellant submitted a \u201cbase tender\u201d and an \u201calternative tender\u201d. In relation to this \u201calternative tender\u201d, which was submitted on 15\u00a0March 1999,</span><a id=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 1]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">the appellant offered an alternative pre-cast/structural design. This alternative design consisted of a change in the original cast-in-situ design to the pre-cast structure design which would result in cost savings of about $200,000 and a shortening of the construction time by two months.</span><a id=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 2]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Employer accepted the alternative design and awarded the appellant a contract dated 24\u00a0June 1999 (\u201cthe Contract\u201d) at a lump sum price of $31.78m to execute and complete the Project. The agreed commencement date of the Contract was 15\u00a0June 1999 and the completion date was 14\u00a0January 2001.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Salient terms of the Contract</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Contract incorporated the terms of the Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract (\u201cPSSCOC\u201d), by which an appointed superintending officer (\u201cSO\u201d) was responsible for the administration and supervision of the Project, including certifying interim payments in respect of the appellant\u2019s work for the Project. In particular, the Contract provided in cl\u00a02.8(1) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Superintending Officer, the Superintending Officer\u2019s Representative or any assistant appointed \u2026 shall at no time be under any obligation or duty to the Contractor [<i>ie</i>, the appellant] either on behalf of the Employer or his own account to exercise or not to exercise any of his powers under the Contract, nor shall any failure to do so on his own part in any way prejudice the rights of the Employer against the Contractor or render the Employer liable to the Contractor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to the settlement of disputes relating to the Project, cl\u00a034 was the governing clause. Its provisions, in so far as they are material, are set out below:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">34.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reference to the Superintending Officer</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a dispute or difference of whatsoever kind shall arise between the Employer or the Superintending Officer or the Superintending Officer\u2019s Representative and the Contractor in connection with or arising out of the Contract or the execution of the Works \u2026 including any dispute or difference as to any \u2026 certificate or valuation of the Superintending Officer or the Superintending Officer\u2019s Representative, it shall in the first place be referred by either party in writing to the Superintending Officer for his decision. \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">34.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reference to Arbitration</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If either the Employer or Contractor is dissatisfied with the decision of the Superintending Officer made pursuant to Clause\u00a034.1 hereof, \u2026 then the Employer or the Contractor may \u2026 give notice to the other party with a copy for information to the Superintending Officer of his intention to refer the decision or the dispute or difference that had not been decided to an arbitrator. \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">However, the amount of damages for which the Employer might be liable to the appellant was qualified by cl\u00a032.8 of the Contract, which provided as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32.8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delay in Certification</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Under no circumstances shall the Employer be liable to pay to the Contractor [<i>ie</i>, the appellant] any damages, whether by way of interest or otherwise, for <i>any failure or delay by the Superintending Officer in certifying any payment due or payable</i> to the Contractor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Appointment of the SO and consultants</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 7\u00a0July 1999, Mindef advised the appellant by letter that Quek Kheng Song (\u201cQKS\u201d) and Huang Siong Hui were appointed the SO and SO\u2019s representative respectively, with Peh Chew Seng as the alternate SO\u2019s representative in the absence of the SO\u2019s representative. At that time, QKS was employed by the Employer as an officer in the Land &amp; Estate Organisation in Mindef. In addition, various individuals and entities were also appointed as consultants to provide professional services for the Project (\u201cthe Consultants\u201d). Among the Consultants appointed was KPK Quantity Surveyors (1995) Pte Ltd (\u201cKPK\u201d), which was appointed the quantity surveyor for the Project. In addition, RDC Architects Pte Ltd (\u201cRDC\u201d) was appointed the architect for the Project.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequent to that, the respondent was constituted under the Defence Science and Technology Agency Act (Cap\u00a075A, 2001\u00a0Rev Ed) in March 2000 and it was around that time that the respondent assumed the role of the SO. QKS was no longer the SO for the Project by this time but continued to represent the respondent at the Project after his employment was transferred from the Employer to the respondent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Summary of tender and cost breakdown</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tender documents for the Project required the appellant to submit a summary of tender (\u201cSOT\u201d) as well as a cost breakdown (\u201cCBD\u201d). The SOT and CBD were documents prepared by KPK listing out all the items of work required for the Project being tendered. It required the contractors who were tendering for the Project to price this itemised list as a cost breakdown of the lump sum contract tender price, in the form of the CBD. The SOT was a summary of the detailed cost itemisation set out in the CBD.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Original SOT and CBD</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As alluded to earlier (at [3] above), as part of its bid, the appellant had offered an alternative tender in addition to the base tender. The SOT and CBD which the appellant had submitted with its tenders were based on the base tender and did not reflect the breakdown under the alternative tender. This meant that the original SOT and CBD did not accurately reflect the scope and actual value of the works to be carried out by the appellant under the alternative tender.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>SOT and CBD incorporated into the Contract</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As such, on the basis of the Employer accepting the appellant\u2019s alternative tender, KPK requested the appellant to submit a revised SOT and CBD to reflect the change of the design. Pursuant to this request, the appellant submitted a revised SOT and CBD dated 24\u00a0May 1999,</span><a id=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 3]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">which it alleged was incorporated into the Contract <i>without</i> any further revision. On the other hand, the respondent contended that there <i>were</i> further revisions to the SOT and CBD dated 24\u00a0May 1999 and that the final SOT and CBD were finalised by KPK with the appellant and incorporated into the Contract in or about October 1999.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Judgment at [9], the trial judge resolved this issue in favour of the respondent, where she said:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After the Employer had accepted the plaintiff\u2019s alternative proposal, KPK requested the plaintiff to submit a revised SOT to reflect the change in design. The plaintiff submitted the first revision to KPK on 24\u00a0May 1999. <i>After further revisions by the plaintiff, the revised SOT and cost breakdown (\u201cCBD\u201d) for the contract price were finalised by KPK with the plaintiff and incorporated into the Contract documents in October 1999</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We agreed with the trial judge\u2019s finding. It was clear to us that the SOT bound into the Contract documents</span><a id=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 4]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">was not the same as the appellant\u2019s revised SOT dated 24\u00a0May 1999. That the SOT bound into the Contract was not a version <i>prior</i> to the SOT dated 24\u00a0May 1999 was supported by the fact that the total cost and contract period were based on the alternative tender. Given that the revised SOT dated 24\u00a0May 1999 was the <i>first</i> SOT based on the alternative tender, it must follow that any <i>other</i> SOT based on the alternative tender must have come <i>after</i> the SOT dated 24\u00a0May 1999. Accordingly, contrary to the appellant\u2019s contention, the SOT dated 24\u00a0May 1999 was indeed revised before it was incorporated into the Contract. This will henceforth be referred to as \u201cthe Contract SOT\u201d while the CBD incorporated into the Contract will be known as \u201cthe Contract CBD\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Exercise to revise the Contract SOT and the Contract CBD</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant contended that, in the course of submitting its progress claims, it discovered that numerous items related to the alternative tender were omitted from the Contract SOT and the Contract CBD and this in turn allegedly led to the under-certification of the progress payments to the appellant. This had occurred even though the Contract SOT and the Contract CBD were bound into the Contract documents after revisions by the appellant itself. These alleged deficiencies in the Contract SOT and the Contract CBD were highlighted by the appellant by a letter dated 29\u00a0September 2000, in which it also submitted a revised SOT and CBD to KPK and requested KPK to review and approve them for use in the future assessment of the appellant\u2019s progress claims.</span><a id=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 5]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The request was initially rejected by the Consultants by their letter of 11\u00a0October 2000,</span><a id=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 6]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">who regarded it as a departure from the terms of the Contract. However, by this time, the respondent and the Consultants had received many unsolicited letters from sub-contractors and suppliers of the appellant complaining that they had been underpaid by the appellant. They also requested the Employer to arrange for direct payment to be made to them for work done.</span><a id=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 7]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Eventually, in view of these developments, a meeting was held on 16\u00a0November 2000 between the representatives of the appellant and respondent. At this meeting, the appellant\u2019s managing director, Dr\u00a0Chi Chao-Ton Tony (\u201cDr\u00a0Chi\u201d), repeated the request for the Contract SOT and the Contract CBD to be revised so as to alleviate the appellant\u2019s cash-flow problems.</span><a id=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 8]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent, on behalf of the Employer, expressed its willingness to consider the appellant\u2019s request to adjust the Contract SOT and the Contract CBD subject to the following conditions:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KPK would evaluate the new SOT and CBD proposed by the appellant to try to ensure that adequate money was allocated for the uncompleted works; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the appellant was to submit a performance bond, equivalent to the amount of money proposed to be reallocated from the uncompleted works, to safeguard the Employer\u2019s interest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">At the meeting, the appellant agreed to the conditions stated above and KPK was tasked to evaluate the appellant\u2019s proposed revision of the Contract SOT and the Contract CBD and to subsequently submit its recommendations to the respondent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KPK completed its assessment on or about 22\u00a0January 2001 and a copy of the proposed revised SOT and CBD (\u201cKPK-revised SOT and CBD\u201d) was sent by KPK to the appellant by a letter dated 1\u00a0February 2001.

The Contract was eventually novated to Neo Corporation Pte Ltd (\u201cNeoCorp\u201d). The novation agreement between the appellant, the Employer and NeoCorp was signed on 16\u00a0July 2001.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the time of the novation, the appellant had only completed about half of the Contract work. In the ordinary course of events, the appellant would have been paid the full lump sum at the end of the Project and would also have been entitled to submit to the Consultants for certification any claim for works not certified. If disputes arose, the appellant was entitled to submit these disputes for resolution in accordance with the arbitration clause (<i>ie</i>, cl\u00a034 of the Contract). However, the appellant lost this right when it novated the Contract to NeoCorp in July 2001. This was the reason why the appellant had decided to pursue a claim against the respondent in tort to recover its alleged losses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Appellant\u2019s claim and trial judge\u2019s findings</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant claimed against the respondent for negligence on the basis that the respondent owed it a duty of care to apply professional skill and judgment in certifying, in a fair and unbiased manner, payment for work carried out by the appellant to avoid causing it any loss due to undervaluation and under-certification of works. The appellant claimed that the respondent breached this duty by negligently undervaluing and under-certifying the appellant\u2019s works, leading to the following losses:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $2,234,704.24, being the difference between the amount claimed by the appellant for works done on site, and the certified amount in progress payment No\u00a023;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $290,102.25, being underpayment of variation orders;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $629,994.59, being loss of profit from the balance of works;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $124,827.02,</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">being loss of management fees from mechanical and electrical variation orders; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $530,324.08,</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">being loss of interest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event, the trial judge dismissed the appellant\u2019s claim. The trial judge found that the respondent did not owe a duty of care to the appellant to avoid causing the latter to suffer pure economic loss through its (the respondent\u2019s) negligent conduct: the Judgment at [92]. Notwithstanding this finding, the trial judge went on to consider the other \u201cmain issues that arose from the evidence adduced at the trial\u201d and held that <i>even if</i> a duty of care had been owed, the evidence was \u201cagainst the [appellant]\u201d and \u201cclearly disproved the breach of any such duty by the [respondent] to the [appellant]\u201d: the Judgment at [92], [93] and [190].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Issues on appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is trite law that, in order to succeed in a claim under the tort of negligence, a claimant has to establish that (a) the defendant owes the claimant a duty of care; (b) the defendant has breached that duty of care by acting (or omitting to act) below the standard of care required of it; (c) the defendant\u2019s breach has caused the claimant damage; (d) the claimant\u2019s losses arising from the defendant\u2019s breach are not too remote; and (e) such losses can be adequately proved and quantified: see, for example, <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2006) at para\u00a08-04.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, the first issue which we had to consider was whether there was a duty of care owed by the respondent to the appellant in the manner we have outlined earlier.

Adopting this approach, the appellant submitted that the following issues arose for our consideration in relation to the existence of a duty of care in this case: (a)\u00a0whether, in the circumstances of this case, there existed a relationship of sufficient proximity so as to give rise to a duty of care on the part of the respondent in respect of a pure economic loss; and (b)\u00a0if so, whether there was any policy consideration that should nonetheless limit or negate the duty established under the first stage. However, the appellant also submitted that before these two issues could even be considered, the court should determine a preliminary issue first, <i>viz</i>, whether the damage suffered by the appellant was foreseeable by the respondent. We shall come back to this submission after we have addressed the current tests in the developed common law jurisdictions on the duty of care.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The current state of the law in Singapore on liability in negligence for pure economic loss, and indeed for physical damage, is not entirely satisfactory. Liability for pure economic loss (which is the subject matter of the appeal before us) is an issue of great complexity and one that imposes on the courts a great responsibility as this is an area of law where the determination of liability has been and will continue to be, unless the Legislature intervenes, the exclusive domain of the Judiciary. Judicial adjudication of claims for pure economic loss calls for caution and judiciousness in not extending the limits of liability for negligent acts to avoid any unforeseen economic cost to the public in the court\u2019s desire to do justice to the claimant in the particular case. It is <i>par excellence</i> a policy decision for the court to make. To begin with, although the English courts have thought fit not to allow recovery of pure economic loss, the Singapore courts have taken a different path and have allowed recovery of such losses in a few decisions. Whether these decisions have laid down a general principle, that pure economic loss can be recovered in all cases of negligence, is a matter we wish to re-examine because of its implications for the redistribution of wealth in the economy. Furthermore, it is important that we revisit this issue as the Singapore courts have also applied a different test to determine the existence of a duty of care when the type of damages claimed is pure economic loss, and when it is for loss associated with physical damage, even though the foundation of the two different tests is derived from a common source, <i>viz</i>, the well-known English decisions in <i>Anns</i> and <i>Caparo.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Preliminary observations</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A few preliminary observations are apposite at this juncture. The common law is built on interconnected layers of principles, universal and particular, each dependent on and interacting with the other, held together by the overarching goal of fairness and justice. To understand this is to comprehend the common law\u2019s eternal search for rational and universal principles in the law. Thus, in the area of negligence, the principles relating to the imposition of a duty of care must be rational and coherent and be reliably and consistently determined. With the universal in the form of general principles, the law will be a coherent body of rules, and not consist of singular instances of judicial decisions unrelated to each other. However, to have the universal without the particular is to lose sight of the need for practical solutions for the myriad of disputes that come before the courts. These general principles provide the focus to which the particular (<i>viz</i>, the facts of decided cases <i>and</i> the present case) must then be analysed so that the courts may, within this aggregation of the universal and the particular, reach a result that is fair and just. As Cooke\u00a0P put it in <i>South Pacific Manufacturing Co Ltd v New Zealand Security Consultants &amp; Investigations Ltd</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 NZLR 282</nobr> at 294:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A broad two-stage approach or <i>any other approach is only a framework, a more or less methodical way of tackling a problem.</i> However it is formulated should not matter in the end. Ultimately the exercise can only be a balancing one and the important object is that all relevant factors be weighed. There is no escape from the truth that, whatever formula be used, the outcome in a grey area case has to be determined by judicial judgment. <i>Formulae can help</i> <i>to organise thinking but they cannot provide answers</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Ultimately, the resolution of a claim in negligence should be based on general principles that have universal application to every factual situation which gives rise to a legal dispute either on liability or damages.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the tort of negligence, careless conduct cannot, by itself, be used as a basis for tortious liability. It is only carelessness within the context of <i>breach of a duty to take care</i> <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> another person that there is liability in negligence, and hence the necessity to determine the circumstances in which the duty of care arises. In other words, even if duty sets the boundaries of liability (as Prof\u00a0Tan Keng Feng put it in \u201cThe Three-Part Test: Yet Another Test of Duty in Negligence\u201d (1989) 31\u00a0Mal\u00a0L\u00a0Rev 223 at 225), it also sets the limits on duty where liability is seen to be indeterminate. The two concepts of duty and liability are of course related but at the same time each affects the operation of the other. The difficulty is in balancing the goal of a fair and just result for the parties and the imposition of indeterminate liability on an indeterminate class of tortfeasors. That is the primary responsibility of the courts in developing the tort of negligence. How to do so without compromising on the usefulness of the tort of negligence as a tool for the redistribution of economic wealth fairly between tortfeasors and their victims is essentially the crucial issue for the courts. Unlike contract, where the rights and liabilities of the parties are primarily agreed or fixed between themselves, tortious liability occurs <i>independently</i> of the parties\u2019 intentions and is hence liable to manifest itself in, potentially, an infinite number of situations, given that carelessness is a human frailty. This was what Cardozo\u00a0CJ was afraid of in <i>Ultramares Corp v Touche, Niven &amp; Co</i> 255 NY\u00a0170 (1931) at 179, <i>ie</i>, the imposition of \u201cliability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class\u201d. Lord Buckmaster also alluded to this concern when he said in <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> [1932] AC\u00a0562 at 577, \u201cIf one step, why not fifty?\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The answer to this lies in legal control mechanisms for which the courts are primarily responsible. Lord Atkin, who may be regarded as the founder of the modern law of negligence, referred to this heavy responsibility in <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> (at 583\u2013584):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]n the branch of the law which deals with civil wrongs, dependent in England at any rate entirely upon the application by judges of general principles also formulated by judges, it is of particular importance to guard against the danger of <i>stating propositions of law in wider terms than is necessary</i>, lest essential factors be omitted in the wider survey and the inherent adaptability of English law be unduly restricted. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, the various tests which have been applied by the courts following <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> are but a manifestation of one or more of the legal control mechanisms formulated by the courts within the general principles. It is essential, at the outset, to note that although there are now many such mechanisms, they all serve the <i>singular purpose</i> of limiting liability, albeit in different ways. To put it another way, these legal control mechanisms ultimately seek to limit liability by resorting to the use of different conceptual tests, such as reasonable foreseeability, proximity or public policy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The different tests in England</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The neighbour principle and its development</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although there were some cases prior to 1932 which purported to articulate some kind of general principle to determine the existence of a duty of care (see, for example, <i>Heaven v Pender</i> (1883) 11\u00a0QBD 503 at 509, <i>per</i> Brett\u00a0MR), the search for a universal basis for duty is generally regarded to have begun with the House of Lords decision of <i>Donoghue v Stevenson.</i> In that case, Lord Atkin famously said (at 580):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer\u2019s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be \u2013 persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This statement was then generally understood to mean that liability was founded on the test of pure foreseeability alone: see <i>Hay or Bourhill v Young</i> [1943] AC\u00a092 at 107, where Lord\u00a0Wright accepted Lord\u00a0Atkin\u2019s statement as establishing the \u201cgeneral concept of reasonable foresight as the criterion of negligence\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, it soon became apparent that a test based on foreseeability alone could be too wide and too pliable as a basis of liability in some situations. In order to limit or exclude what was deemed as unwarranted recovery, the courts frequently resorted to deciding artificially that certain claimants were \u201cunforeseeable\u201d: see Prof\u00a0Tan ([29] <i>supra</i>) at 225. This led Lord\u00a0Denning to consider foreseeability and the existence of a duty as simply a question of public policy. In <i>Spartan Steel &amp; Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co (Contractors) Ltd</i> [1973] QB\u00a027, Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR said (at 36):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Whenever the courts draw a line to make out the bounds of duty, they do it as <i>matter of policy</i> so as to limit the responsibility of the defendant. [emphasis added].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Similarly, in <i>Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office</i> [1969] 2\u00a0QB\u00a0412, Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR said (at 426):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Duty] is, I think, at bottom a matter of public policy which we, as judges, must resolve. This talk of \u201cduty\u201d or \u201cno duty\u201d is simply a way of limiting the range of liability for negligence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The two-stage test in</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Anns</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pendulum which swung between foreseeability and policy as the determinant of duty showed signs of resting in <i>Arenson v Casson Beckman Rutley &amp; Co</i> [1977] AC\u00a0405, in which Lord\u00a0Simon of Glaisdale appeared to endorse the idea that where Lord Atkin\u2019s neighbour principle was seen as fixing the defendant with responsibility for the claimant\u2019s damage, liability should follow, save where there was some good reason why it should not, and identified \u201cpublic policy\u201d as the qualifying factor (at 419). That pendulum finally became stationary in favour of an approach which meshed foreseeability with public policy in <i>Anns</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), where Lord\u00a0Wilberforce influentially said (at 751\u2013752):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]n order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situation, <i>it is not necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty of care has been held to exist</i>. Rather the question has to be approached in two stages. First one has to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suffered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter \u2013 in which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly, if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of persons to whom it is owed or the damages to which breach of it may give rise \u2026 [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i> It is well known that there is some controversy regarding the meaning of the first stage of the test: Did it relate only to the <i>factual</i> issue of reasonable foreseeability <i>or</i> did it introduce the <i>legal</i> conception of proximity (see further Phang, Saw &amp; Chan ([26] <i>supra</i>) at 40\u201341)? We will revisit this problem later (see [74] below). For the moment, it suffices to note that this pronouncement in <i>Anns</i> is not only significant for the elucidation of a two-stage test to determine duty, it also introduced the concept of a truly \u201cuniversal\u201d test in that it could be applied without reference to previous decisions where the duty might or might not have been seen to have existed. This attracted considerable criticisms from many other judges who thought that the much sought-after universal basis for duty is unattainable and even undesirable, and that an incremental approach based on previous decisions on a case by case basis was less subjective and therefore preferable.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, these criticisms have arisen because of the perceived divorce of the particular from the universal (see [28] above). Whether or not Lord Wilberforce intended for his test to apply in a vacuum, distanced from all considerations of prior decisions, is not exactly clear, since the essence of the common law (which Lord Wilberforce must have known) is by its very nature incremental. A fair reading of the sentence (see [33] above) beginning with \u201cin order to establish \u2026 it is not necessary to bring the facts within those of previous situations\u201d does not preclude an incremental approach as the expression \u201cthe facts\u201d does necessarily connote <i>all</i> the facts, and is capable of implying that it is only necessary to bring <i>only some of the facts</i>. However, as the formula was perceived as such, it led to the concern of a potentially uncontrollable expansion of liability.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The two-stage test in</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Anns <em>doubted and overruled</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> This concern led to a check of the advance of the two-stage test in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Anns</i> as doctrine.

This is a temptation which should be resisted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Similarly, the Australian High Court gave reasons in <i>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman</i> (1985) 60\u00a0ALR\u00a01 (\u201c<i>Sutherland</i>\u201d) for declining to follow the direction in which <i>Anns</i> appeared to be taking the law in England. Brennan\u00a0J stated (at 43\u201344) that it was preferable that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he law should develop novel categories of negligence incrementally and by analogy with established categories, rather than by a massive extension of a prima facie duty of care restrained only by indefinable \u201cconsiderations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following this, Lord\u00a0Brandon of Oakbrook remarked in <i>Leigh and Sillavan Ltd v Aliakmon Shipping Co Ltd</i> [1986] AC\u00a0785 at 815 that the propositions laid down by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Anns</i> \u201c[do] not provide, and cannot \u2026 have been intended by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce to provide, a universally applicable test of the existence and scope of a duty of care in the law of negligence\u201d. The Privy Council in <i>Yuen Kun Yeu v Attorney-General of Hong Kong</i> [1988] AC\u00a0175 (\u201c<i>Yuen Kun Yeu</i>\u201d) further expressed the opinion that whether or not a duty of care in negligence existed would depend primarily upon foreseeability of damage, together with the existence of a close and direct relationship or proximity between the parties, and that, occasionally, it would be necessary to go on to consider whether public policy required that liability should not attach. Lord\u00a0Keith of Kinkel observed in <i>Yuen Kun Yeu</i> (at 191) that the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> \u201chas been elevated to a degree of importance greater than it merits, and greater perhaps than its author intended\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> was finally overruled by the House of Lords in <i>Murphy v Brentwood District Council</i> [1991] 1\u00a0AC\u00a0398 (\u201c<i>Murphy</i>\u201d). In unanimously holding that the defendant council owed no duty of care to the claimant (a subsequent home owner) in respect of pure economic loss, Lord\u00a0Keith of Kinkel observed thus (at 471):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In my opinion it is clear that <i>Anns</i> did not proceed upon any basis of established principle, but introduced a new species of liability governed by a principle indeterminate in character but having the potentiality of covering a wide range of situations, involving chattels as well as real property, in which it had never hitherto been thought that the law of negligence had any proper place.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">He continued (at 471\u2013472):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In my opinion there can be no doubt that <i>Anns</i> has for long been widely regarded as an unsatisfactory decision. In relation to the scope of the duty owed by a local authority it proceeded upon what must, with due respect to its source, be regarded as a somewhat superficial examination of principle and there has been extreme difficulty, highlighted most recently by the speeches in [<i>D\u00a0&amp;\u00a0F Estates Ltd v Church Commissioners for England</i> [1989] AC\u00a0177], in ascertaining upon exactly what basis of principle it did proceed. I think it must now be recognised that it did not proceed on any basis of principle at all, but constituted a remarkable example of judicial legislation. It has engendered a vast spate of litigation, and each of the cases in the field which have reached this House has been distinguished. Others have been distinguished in the Court of Appeal. The result has been to keep the effect of the decision within reasonable bounds, but that has been achieved only by applying strictly the words of Lord Wilberforce and by refusing to accept the logical implications of the decision itself. These logical implications show that the case properly considered has potentiality for collision with long-established principles regarding liability in the tort of negligence for economic loss. There can be no doubt that to depart from the decision would re-establish a degree of certainty in this field of law which it has done a remarkable amount to upset.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The three-part test in</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Caparo</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the fall of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>, another approach to determine the existence of a duty of care emerged. In <i>Smith v Eric S\u00a0Bush</i> [1990] 1\u00a0AC 831, Lord\u00a0Griffiths, in dealing with the question of when the law deems a person who has given advice to have assumed responsibility to the recipient who has acted on it and suffered damage, replied (at 865):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I would answer \u2013 only if it is foreseeable that if the advice is negligent the recipient is likely to suffer damage, that there is a sufficiently proximate relationship between the parties and that it is just and reasonable to impose the liability.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This trend towards a three-part test was summarised by Lord\u00a0Bridge of Harwich in <i>Caparo</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) thus (at 617\u2013618):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">What emerges is that, in addition to the foreseeability of damage, necessary ingredients in any situation giving rise to a duty of care are that there should exist between the party owing the duty and the party to whom it is owed a relationship characterised by the law as one of \u201cproximity\u201d or \u201cneighbourhood\u201d and that the situation should be one in which the court considers it fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of a given scope upon the one party for the benefit of the other.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The three-part test in <i>Caparo</i> is, by no means, unambiguous in its application; indeed, the very judges who had formulated it expressed their belief that it was unlikely to be a workable test. Lord\u00a0Bridge himself cautioned (at 618) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he concepts of proximity and fairness embodied in these additional ingredients are not susceptible of any such precise definition as would be necessary to give them utility as practical tests, but amount in effect to little more than convenient labels to attach to the features of different specific situations which, on a detailed examination of all the circumstances, the law recognises pragmatically as giving rise to a duty of care of a given scope.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Similarly, Lord\u00a0Roskill gave a warning (at 628) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Phrases such as \u201cforeseeability,\u201d \u201cproximity,\u201d \u201cneighbourhood,\u201d \u201djust and reasonable,\u201d \u201cfairness,\u201d \u2026 will be found used from time to time in the different cases. But \u2026 such phrases are not precise definitions. At best they are but labels or phrases descriptive of the very different factual situations which can exist in particular cases and which must be carefully examined in each case before it can be pragmatically determined whether a duty of care exists and, if so, what is the scope and extent of that duty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In other words, some overlapping or merging of the three criteria will occur according to the particular circumstances: see also Steyn\u00a0LJ\u2019s comments in <i>Elguzouli-Daf v Commission of Police of the Metropolis</i> [1995] QB\u00a0335 at 349. In a similar vein, in <i>Marc Rich &amp; Co AG v Bishop Rock Marine Co Ltd</i> [1994] 1\u00a0WLR\u00a01071, Balcombe\u00a0LJ said (at 1088) that he doubted whether the words \u201cfair, just and reasonable\u201d imposed a test additional to that of \u201cproximity\u201d. He went on to state that \u201cthese are criteria to be adopted in considering whether the necessary degree of proximity exists\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The incremental approach</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, it ought to be noted that the House of Lords in <i>Caparo</i> also endorsed the <i>incremental</i> approach advocated by Brennan\u00a0J in the Australian High Court decision of <i>Sutherland</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>). Lord\u00a0Bridge observed (at 618) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Whilst recognising, of course, the importance of the underlying general principles common to the whole field of negligence, I think the law has now moved in the direction of attaching greater significance to the more traditional categorisation of distinct and recognisable situations as guides to the existence, the scope and the limits of the varied duties of care which the law imposes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the English courts have accepted incrementalism as a useful guide, Prof\u00a0Keith Stanton has noted in \u201cIncremental Approaches to the Duty of Care\u201d (in <i>Torts in the Nineties</i> (Nicholas\u00a0J\u00a0Mullany ed) (LBC Information Services, 1997) at p\u00a044), that no consistent pattern emerges to indicate what the courts understand by this term. Prof\u00a0Stanton is of the view (at p\u00a039) that, at a general level, \u201cincrementalism may be regarded as restoring a traditional method of adjudication to the tort of negligence\u201d in that it remains intertwined with a formula-based approach, and that the general principle should henceforth be applied in a more cautious manner. On the other hand, at a more detailed level, incrementalism can be taken to mean the development of \u201cpockets of duty of care\u201d, modified and developed by the slow incremental accretion of case law, in lieu of a general principle which provides the basis of analysis. Indeed, the three-part test in <i>Caparo</i> stands in apparent distinction from the incremental approach which was, somewhat curiously, advocated in the same case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If incrementalism is intended to return the development of liability in negligence to the basis that discrete sets of rules should govern different factual scenarios, the central problem, as Prof\u00a0Stanton noted at p\u00a048, is that it requires a return to an approach which has been systematically destroyed since <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i>, as generations of lawyers have since been trained to believe that the tort of negligence is based on a common general principle. In this respect, we agree with Lord\u00a0Bingham of Cornhill in <i>Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc</i> [2007] 1\u00a0AC 181 (\u201c<i>Customs and Excise Commissioners</i>\u201d), where he observed (at [7]) that the \u201cincremental test is of little value as a test in itself, and is only helpful when used in combination with a test or principle which identifies the legally significant features of a situation\u201d. In our view, incrementalism is not a distinct and alternative method which results in a plethora of discrete sets of rules (as opposed to a set of general (and universal) principles). Instead, it is an analogical process to <i>apply</i> specific facts to the general principle. According to this approach, a court should, when applying the specific step of the general principle, utilise the incremental methodology to decide first whether that specific step (or criterion) can be satisfied <i>with reference to decided cases</i>. This will provide an essential check to any unwarranted expansion of liability for negligent acts. However, as we will further observe (at [72] below), where there are no decided cases, recourse to general principles is not only valid but also desirable. Such an approach, an interaction of the universal with the particular (see [28] above), would, in our view, aid in the development of a rational and purposive concept of negligence which can achieve fairness and justice in each case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Other tests</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The cases referred to above may be regarded as the main current in the search for a test for the existence of a duty of care in novel situations. But there have been other side-currents, particularly in relation to liability for psychiatric harm and negligent misstatements causing pure economic loss. A line of authority from <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> [1964] AC\u00a0465 (\u201c<i>Hedley Byrne</i>\u201d) has grounded liability for the latter on an <i>assumption of responsibility</i> towards the recipient of the statement in question and <i>reliance</i> by him on its accuracy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for acts or omissions causing pure economic loss, English law currently prevents recovery for such claims. In <i>Murphy</i> ([38] <i>supra</i>), the House of Lords adopted what is known as the \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d in relation to cases involving pure economic loss flowing from careless acts or omissions. Lord\u00a0Oliver of Aylmerton said (at 487) that if the infliction of loss by the defendant on the claimant was to be categorised as wrongful, it was necessary to find some factor beyond the mere occurrence of the loss and the fact that its occurrence could be foreseen. What was necessary was evidently a relationship of proximity so close that it was \u201cakin to contract\u201d (<i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Bridge of Harwich in <i>Murphy</i> at 481) to introduce the element of reliance such that the scope of the duty of care owed by the defendant to the claimant was wide enough to embrace pure economic loss. Lord\u00a0Oliver further noted that the <i>categorisation</i> of damage as economic served at least the useful purpose of indicating that something more was required. However, it has long been recognised that the effect of <i>Murphy</i> is simply that English law will deny the existence of a duty of care to any individual suffering pure economic loss caused by careless acts or omissions where there is neither personal injury nor property damage: see <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 2006) at para\u00a02-134. The reason for this appears to be a fear of indeterminate liability owing to the fluid nature of pure economic losses which are not strictly restricted by the physical interaction of the parties involved (see further [66] below).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Current position in England</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The search for clarity and certainty in a single formula has proved to be elusive even some 60 years after the first articulation of the \u201cneighbour\u201d principle in <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i>.

Damage arising from different situations (<i>viz</i>, pure economic loss or physical damage) is seen to require the application of different tests, and even within the rubric of physical damage, there is some confusion as regards which of the three tests is applicable to determine a duty of care.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On appeal in <i>Customs and Excise Commissioners</i> ([43] <i>supra</i>), the House of Lords did not express a definitive view on whether or not the three \u201ctests\u201d mentioned by Longmore\u00a0LJ were substantive tests in their own right and were all to be applied in any given case. Indeed, the general position adopted by the House itself is, with respect, none too clear (see also Steven Gee, \u201cThe Remedies Carried by a Freezing Injunction\u201d (2006) 122 LQR\u00a0535, especially at 536). Thus, as Andrew Phang Boon Leong\u00a0J (as he then was) observed in <i>Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 853</nobr> (\u201c<i>Sunny Metal</i>\u201d) at [79], the position in England, even at the present, continues to be in a \u201cstate of flux and confusion\u201d. This situation does not make it easier for the Singapore courts, but it does present them with an opportunity to revisit the subject and to try to fashion a general test that is principled and logical and capable of practical application to all cases where damage is caused by a negligent act. In this connection, it should be borne in mind that all such problems that come before the courts are evaluated and assessed on a retrospective and not a prospective basis; the damage has arisen and the only question is whether there is liability for it. This condition should, in most situations, give the courts an advantage in being able to see whether, on the facts of the case, the application of the test is likely to lead to an unmanageable expansion of liability for negligent acts or omissions that may be detrimental to the national welfare.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The different tests in Singapore</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to examine the current position in Singapore.

The rationale for this departure from the English position was explained in the subsequent case of <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers v MCST Plan No\u00a01075</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 449</nobr> (\u201c<i>Eastern Lagoon</i>\u201d), where this court stated (at [43]) that there were cogent policy reasons to allow for claims of pure economic loss in relation to immovable property since land was scarce in Singapore and the financial outlay in such properties represented a significant investment in a person\u2019s lifetime.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Ocean Front</i>, the management corporation (\u201cMC\u201d) of Bayshore Park Condominium took out a writ against the developer of that condominium for damages arising out of the faulty construction of common property. This court applied the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) and relied on <i>Junior Books Ltd v Veitchi Co Ltd</i> [1983] 1\u00a0AC 520 (\u201c<i>Junior Books</i>\u201d) and found the developer liable in negligence for economic loss caused to the MC with whom the developer had no contractual relationship. The approach which this court took was that it first considered whether there was (on the facts of the case) sufficient proximity between the parties, which would give rise to a duty of care. L\u00a0P\u00a0Thean\u00a0JA, who delivered the judgment of the court, observed (at 139, [69]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">But the approach of the court has been to examine a particular circumstance to determine whether there exists that degree of proximity\u00a0between the plaintiff and the defendant as would give rise to a duty of care by the latter to the former with respect to the damage sustained by the former. <i>Such proximity is the \u2018determinant\u2019 of the duty of care and also the scope of such duty</i>.

It found no policy reason negativing the duty of care primarily because the ambit of liability was determinate. Indeed, in our view, for the very reasons given by the court in deciding that there was proximity in that case, the policy considerations would be in favour of imposing liability on the developer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Ocean Front</i> was followed by <i>Eastern Lagoon</i> ([51] <i>supra</i>), in which this court revisited its holdings in <i>Ocean Front</i>. This court expressly rejected the \u201ctwo-stage test\u201d in <i>Anns</i> but adopted what was <i>substantively</i> a similar test. L\u00a0P\u00a0Thean\u00a0JA, who delivered the judgment of the court, observed thus (at [18]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It seems to us that what is objectionable in that passage [containing Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s test in <i>Anns</i>] is firstly his Lordship\u2019s sweeping proposition of a single general rule or principle which can be applied in every situation to determine whether a duty of care arises and secondly the fact that the test propounded by his Lordship in the first stage was based on foreseeability of damage alone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">And later, at [29]\u2013[30]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is abundantly clear that in <i>Ocean Front</i> this court did not follow the broad proposition laid down by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Anns</i>. True, the court reached its conclusion by a two-stage process. In principle, there is no objection to such approach. It depends on what is involved and considered in each stage. The court certainly did not apply the first test in <i>Anns</i>. The court\u2019s finding that there was sufficient degree of proximity giving rise to a duty on the part of the developers to avoid the loss sustained by the management corporation was not premised on foreseeability of damage alone, but on the consideration of other relevant facts. Nor did the court accept Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s proposition that in any given situation a single general rule or principle can be applied to determine whether a duty of care arises.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It does not follow from the mere fact that the court in the course of their determination examined the facts by the two-stage process that the court in effect followed <i>Anns</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As to what this \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d entailed, Thean\u00a0JA continued at [31]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Stripped of the verbiage, the crux of such approach [<i>ie</i>, the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d] is no more than this: the court first examines and considers the facts and factors to determine whether there is sufficient degree of proximity in the relationship between the party who has sustained the loss and the party who is said to have caused the loss which would give rise to a duty of care on the part of the latter to avoid the kind of loss sustained by the former. \u2026 Next, having found such degree of proximity, the court next considers whether there is any material factor or policy which precludes such duty from arising.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d was only applicable to cases of pure economic loss was confirmed in <i>The Sunrise Crane</i> <nobr>[2004] 4 SLR 715</nobr>. In that case, the majority (at [31]\u2013[37]) referred to <i>Man B&amp;W Diesel S\u00a0E\u00a0Asia Pte Ltd v</i> <i>PT\u00a0Bumi International Tankers</i> <nobr>[2004] 2 SLR 300</nobr> (\u201c<i>Man B&amp;W Diesel</i>\u201d) and <i>Ocean Front</i> and held that the approach used in those cases (<i>ie</i>, the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d) was <i>limited</i> <i>to pure economic loss situations</i> and thus was not applicable to <i>The Sunrise Crane</i>, which concerned physical damage. The majority therefore applied the three-part test in <i>Caparo</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) to the case at hand. However, the dissenting judge in <i>The Sunrise Crane</i> took the view that a <i>uniform</i> approach should be applied to all cases of negligence, with the salient features of each case being determinative of the existence and scope of duty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The result of the majority\u2019s pronouncement in <i>The Sunrise Crane</i>, as Dr\u00a0Kumaralingam Amirthalingam notes in \u201c<i>The Sunrise Crane</i> \u2013 Shedding New Light or Casting Old Shadows on Duty of Care?\u201d [2004] Sing\u00a0JLS\u00a0551 at 555, is that in Singapore, the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d in <i>Ocean Front</i> is to be applied in cases of pure economic loss, while the three-part test in <i>Caparo</i> is to be applied in all other situations (<i>ie</i>, cases of physical damage).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, in <i>United Project Consultants Pte Ltd v Leong Kwok Onn</i> <nobr>[2005] 4 SLR 214</nobr> (\u201c<i>United Project Consultants</i>\u201d) at [27], this court held that, in determining whether to impose a duty of care in cases of pure economic loss (which was the case in <i>United Project Consultants</i>), the courts have \u201cconsistently adopted a more <i>restrictive</i> approach\u201d [emphasis added] and applied the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d in <i>Ocean Front</i>. After endorsing Thean\u00a0JA\u2019s statement of the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d in <i>Eastern Lagoon</i> (see [56] above), this court went on to state (at [35]) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In essence, before liability may be imposed upon a defendant for pure economic loss, a court must be satisfied that all the circumstances of the case give rise to a relationship whereby the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to avoid the particular loss suffered by the plaintiff. In doing so, the court must likewise be satisfied that there are no policy reasons why such a duty ought not to be imposed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">However, it then expressly went on to clarify (at [36]) that the \u201crestatement of the principle in [<i>Eastern Lagoon</i>] <i>should not be construed as reverting to the two-stage test in</i> Anns\u201d [emphasis added].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At first glance, the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d is substantively similar to the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>; indeed, it even involves the same elements as stated by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Anns</i>: see also <i>Man B&amp;W Diesel</i> at [29]. On another view, however, the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d is a \u201chybrid or composite test\u201d in that it is not wholly \u201cuniversal\u201d in nature, since the court in <i>Ocean Front</i> pointed out that the facts of that case were similar to <i>Junior Books</i> ([52] <i>supra</i>) and <i>Bryan v Maloney</i> (1995) 69\u00a0ALJR 375, ostensibly using both these cases as precedents from which to advance the imposition of a duty of care in that case, a process not dissimilar to the incremental approach alluded to in <i>Caparo</i>: see Debbie Ong Siew Ling, \u201cThe Test of Duty for Defects in Property Causing Pure Economic Loss\u201d [1999] Sing\u00a0JLS\u00a0667 at 670\u2013671.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, if one were to construe Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s words in <i>Anns</i> <i>literally</i> (see [33] above), such that there was no longer a need to draw analogies with decided cases, it would be true that the \u201ctwo-step process\u201d does constitute a \u201chybrid or composite\u201d test. However, as we stated earlier (see [43] above), the common law methodology is essentially incremental in nature, drawing its conclusions from <i>precedents</i>, and this necessarily presupposes that <i>even within the confines of a general principle</i>, there remains the scope for the application of an analogising or incremental approach, and the two must not be viewed as being mutually exclusive. As such, it may be better to view this court\u2019s characterisation in that case of the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d as being wholly unrelated to Lord Wilberforce\u2019s two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> and as a reflection of the reluctance of the local courts at that time to follow an English authority which had been discredited. It would therefore have been better had this court in <i>Eastern Lagoon</i> simply acknowledged that it was, in substance and effect, applying the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Three-part test for cases of physical damage</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to the decisions applying the three-part test in <i>Caparo</i>. As we mentioned earlier, for cases <i>not</i> involving pure economic loss, it is the three-part test in <i>Caparo</i> which has also been endorsed in the Singapore context: see, for example, <i>Ikumene Singapore Pte Ltd v Leong Chee Leng</i> <nobr>[1993] 3 SLR 24</nobr> (\u201c<i>Ikumene</i>\u201d); <i>Standard Chartered Bank v Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i> <nobr>[1993] 3 SLR 712</nobr>; <i>Pang Koi Fa v Lim Djoe Phing</i> <nobr>[1993] 3 SLR 317</nobr>; <i>Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 505</nobr>; <i>D v Kong Sim Guan</i> <nobr>[2003] 3 SLR 146</nobr>; <i>TV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea Heidi</i> <nobr>[2004] 3 SLR 543</nobr> (\u201c<i>TV Media Pte Ltd</i>\u201d); and <i>The Sunrise Crane</i> ([57] <i>supra</i>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear that the courts take the view that the three-part test in <i>Caparo</i> involves an incremental approach. In <i>Ikumene</i>, this court reiterated (at 29, [18]) what Brennan\u00a0J said in the Australian High Court in <i>Sutherland</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>) at 43\u201344 (see [36] above). However, for reasons we have mentioned earlier, our courts have not made clear the relationship between the three-part test in <i>Caparo</i> and the incremental approach. We repeat our view that the application of a general principle does not exclude an incremental approach; the latter is a method by which the general principle is to be applied. The universal and the particular interact to produce a result that is fair and just.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Overview of the problems</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The search for the applicable test is not restricted to preferring one test over the other; a related question is whether there should be different tests to determine the existence of a duty of care for cases of pure economic loss and cases of physical damage. Why should there be two different tests, and what difference does it make, since the final result the courts wish to achieve is the same, <i>viz</i>, that which is fair and just between the parties without imposing an unacceptable economic cost to the public. We now consider whether a different or modified approach should apply to determine the existence of a duty of care in cases of pure economic loss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">different approach to determine duty of care in cases of pure economic loss?</span></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Rationale for different approach</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated earlier (see [45] above), pure economic loss arising from acts or omissions is not recoverable in England, although losses arising from negligent misstatements are recoverable, provided that there exists a special relationship between the parties concerned. In Singapore, while pure economic loss is recoverable, the courts have advocated a more restricted approach in its recovery, to the extent of purporting to apply a different test (<i>ie</i>, the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d in <i>Ocean Front</i>) to supposedly reflect this different treatment of such losses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A possible explanation for the courts\u2019 adoption of a more restrictive approach could be the express reference made by this court in <i>The Sunrise Crane</i> to a passage from <i>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th\u00a0Ed, 2000) which sets out a rationale for the difference between pure economic loss and losses associated with physical damage. This passage is as follows (at para\u00a07-85):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Three features distinguish economic loss claims from most physical damage claims. First, whilst the links between negligence and physical damage depend largely on the laws of nature and necessarily limit the type of relationship giving rise to a claim, those between negligence and pure economic loss are primarily human in creation and can form a complex web through which economic losses can ripple out from the one negligent act. Secondly, because the economic relationships are frequently created rather than imposed, the participants in the web have a greater opportunity to use contracts to determine the level of risk to be taken and the degree of protection from loss required. \u2026 Thirdly, as Hobhouse\u00a0L.J. has observed, \u201cin a competitive economic society the conduct of one person is always liable to have economic consequences for another and, in principle, economic activity does not have to have regard to the interests of others and is justifiable by the actor having regard to his own interests alone\u201d. Furthermore, as McHugh\u00a0J. has noted, \u201cpure economic losses frequently result in mere transfers of wealth. The plaintiff\u2019s loss is the defendant\u2019s or a third party\u2019s gain\u201d, whereas \u201charm to a person or property ordinarily involves a new loss to social wealth.\u201d These features have led the courts to take a more restrictive approach to the imposition of a duty of care in relation to economic loss than in relation to physical damage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Is a different approach justified?</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to the reasons traditionally given as justification for a different approach, Robby Bernstein points out in <i>Economic Loss</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 1998) (at p\u00a021) that it is important to note that it is not anything inherent in the <i>type of the damage</i> itself that necessitates a different approach:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Rather, it is the <i>circumstances</i> in which the economic loss has arisen which sound an alarm that something more is required to warrant the imposition of a duty of care on the defendant for the plaintiff\u2019s loss than the mere fact that it was reasonably foreseeable that the defendant\u2019s negligent act or omission would cause that loss to the plaintiff. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the case of <i>Leigh and Sillivan Ltd v Aliakmon Shipping Co Ltd</i> [1985] QB\u00a0350, Oliver\u00a0LJ (as he then was) recognised this point when he said (at 375):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The premise appears to be that the reason why, in the older authorities, the plaintiff failed to recover damages was that the damage which he suffered was \u201ceconomic\u201d \u2026 Speaking for myself, <i>I have not felt able to accept that premise</i>, for as I read those cases it was <i>not</i> the \u201ceconomic\u201d quality of the damage which prevented recovery <i>but the reason why that damage had occurred</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Similarly, he, as Lord\u00a0Oliver in <i>Murphy</i> ([38] <i>supra</i>), reiterated this point (at 485):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]t is far from clear from these decisions [<i>ie</i>, the various economic loss cases which he had just referred to] that the reason for the plaintiff\u2019s failure was simply that the only loss sustained was \u201ceconomic.\u201d Rather they seem to have been based either upon the remoteness of the damage as a matter of direct causation or, more probably, upon the \u201cfloodgates\u201d argument of the impossibility of containing liability within any acceptable bounds if the law were to permit such claims to succeed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, as Bernstein notes in <i>Economic Loss</i> (at p\u00a021), the House of Lords in <i>Murphy</i> failed to realise that if the concerns articulated above do not in fact exist, then there is <i>no need</i> for the law to adopt an unduly restrictive approach towards the imposition of duties of care for <i>all</i> cases involving pure economic loss. To do so based <i>only</i> on the type of damages sustained (<i>ie</i>, economic loss as opposed to physical damage) would be to misunderstand the foundational principle upon which the restrictive principle towards cases of pure economic loss was conceptualised in the first place. There will be cases of pure economic loss in which the concern of indeterminate liability does not arise. Each case must be looked at on its own facts. Indeed, in the Australian High Court decision of <i>Sutherland</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>), Mason\u00a0J (as he then was) said (at 32):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The proposition that, in general, damages are not recoverable for economic loss unless it is consequential upon injury to the plaintiff\u2019s personal property is <i>by no means absolute or inflexible</i>; it is a reflection of the law\u2019s concern about endless indeterminate liability. In the absence of any such concern in a particular class of case, <i>there is no necessity to give effect to the proposition</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As Mason\u00a0CJ, he reiterated this point in <i>Bryan v Maloney</i> ([60] <i>supra</i>). Mason\u00a0CJ, when delivering the majority judgment (at 380), said:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he policy considerations underlying the reluctance of the courts to recognise a relationship of proximity and a consequent duty of care in cases of mere economic loss are inapplicable to a relationship of the kind which existed between [the parties in this case] \u2026 [T]here is no basis for thinking that recognition of a relationship of proximity between builder and first owner with respect to that particular kind of economic loss would give rise to the type of liability \u201cin an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class\u201d which the courts are reluctant to recognise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">69<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i> We respectfully agree that there is no justification for a <i>general</i> exclusionary rule against recovery of all economic losses and indeed, this is already the position the Singapore courts have taken, following <i>Ocean Front</i>. In this connection, we would also note that the Singapore cases which have allowed claims for pure economic losses have all been related to the economic value of the land. Indeed, for the condominium cases, as we have considered above at [51], the common property was intended to be for the enjoyment of the condominium owners and, by purchasing the condominium units, each owner was also effectively purchasing a share of the common property, as contemplated by the statutory regime on strata titles. For this reason, the MC may be regarded as the alter ego of the owners of the condominium units. Without the artificial but necessary interposition of the MC, there would have been a direct contractual relationship between the developers and the condominium owners. This very close relationship between the developers and the MC alleviates any fear of indeterminate liability owing to the nature of pure economic losses. Although the Singapore decisions on pure economic loss have been largely restricted to such situations, we are of the view that there is no reason not to extend liability for pure economic loss to other situations, provided that the issues of indeterminate liability and policy can be adequately dealt with. In this connection, the incremental approach would provide a necessary safeguard against the unintended consequence of indeterminate liability as well as discourage arbitrariness in determining liability.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the question then is whether we should continue to adopt a different <i>test</i> for cases of pure economic loss, as distinguished from cases of physical damage. In our opinion, quite apart from the doctrinal untidiness of having two applicable tests, depending on the <i>nature</i> of the damage (<i>ie</i>, the \u201ctwo-stage process\u201d in <i>Ocean Front</i> for cases of pure economic loss and the three-stage test in <i>Caparo</i> for cases of physical damage), this approach does not, in fact, address the concerns which prompted the more restrictive approach for <i>some,</i> but not all, cases of pure economic loss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As such, in our view, a <i>single</i> test is preferable in order to determine the imposition of a duty of care in all claims arising out of negligence, <i>irrespective</i> of the <i>type</i> of the damages claimed, and this should include claims for pure economic loss, whether they arise from negligent misstatements or acts/omissions. In cases of <i>physical</i> damage, there is usually no difficulty with regard to a control mechanism to prevent indeterminate liability. However, the adoption of a single test would serve to constrain liability <i>even in</i> those extremely rare cases where <i>physical</i> damage <i>might possibly</i> result in indeterminate liability. It may well be that there are policy considerations in restricting recovery for pure economic loss in <i>certain</i> situations, but this in itself does not make it necessary for a wholly different approach in the form of a separate test altogether.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately, a single test to determine the existence of a duty of care for all claims of negligence would do well to eliminate the perception that there are, at once, two or more tests which are equally applicable. While it may be that all these tests could yield the same result, their serial applicability diminishes the desirability of having a general principle that can provide a coherent, consistent and reliable way of determining or recognising a duty of care. We now turn our attention to considering what the <i>single</i> applicable test may be.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The applicable test in Singapore</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, a coherent and workable test can be fashioned out of the basic two-stage test premised on proximity and policy considerations, if its application is preceded by a preliminary requirement of <i>factual</i> foreseeability. We would add that this test is to be applied <i>incrementally</i>, in the sense that when applying the test in each stage, it would be desirable to refer to decided cases in analogous situations to see how the courts have reached their conclusions in terms of proximity and/or policy. As is obvious, the existence of analogous precedents, which determines the current limits of liability, would make it easier for the later court to determine whether or not to extend its limits. However, the absence of a factual precedent, which implies the presence of a novel situation, should not preclude the court from extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking into account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate liability against a tortfeasor. We would admit at this juncture that this is basically a restatement of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>, tempered by the preliminary requirement of factual foreseeability. Indeed, we should point out that this is the test applied in substance by many jurisdictions in the Commonwealth: see, for example, the Canadian case of <i>Cooper v Hobart</i> (2001) 206\u00a0DLR (4th) 193; the New Zealand case of <i>Rolls-Royce New Zealand Ltd v Carter Holt Harvey Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] 1 NZLR 324</nobr>; and the general summary provided in Phang, Saw &amp; Chan ([26] <i>supra</i>) at 9\u201328.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now set out in detail the various elements in the approach outlined above. We will also illustrate how this approach is to be applied practically when we apply it to the facts of the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Factual foreseeability</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we mentioned earlier (see [34] above), there is some controversy in relation to the interpretation of the first stage of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s test in <i>Anns</i>, <i>ie</i>, whether it refers to mere factual foreseeability or legal foreseeability or proximity. In our view, factual foreseeability is too wide a criterion to be effective as a legal control mechanism if all that it means is that the defendant ought to have known that the claimant would suffer damage from his (the defendant\u2019s) carelessness. If this is the approach to be adopted, it would be fulfilled in almost all cases, because the two parties are likely to be in some degree of physical relationship in the relevant case. As Phang\u00a0J said in <i>Sunny Metal</i> ([49] <i>supra</i>) at [55]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The first part of the \u201cthree-part test\u201d (relating to \u201cforeseeability\u201d) is, in effect, a reference to the <i>factual</i> conception of reasonable foreseeability or proximity. It is, in other words, what I have earlier termed \u2026 as \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d. Although this consideration has been incorporated as an element within the \u201cthree-part test\u201d itself, its incorporation is, with respect, <i>unnecessary</i>. As I have already pointed out above \u2026 the requirement of reasonable foreseeability from a <i>factual</i> perspective will <i>almost always be satisfied</i>, simply because of its very nature and the very wide nature of the \u201cnet\u201d it necessarily casts. There is therefore <i>no practical need</i> to include such a <i>factual</i> element within a <i>legal</i> formulation such as exists with regard to the existence (or otherwise) of <i>a duty of care</i>. \u2026 This is not to state that this last-mentioned (<i>factual</i>) element is to be discarded. As I have already mentioned, it will <i>almost always</i> be satisfied.

Indeed, as the Privy Council said in <i>Yuen Kun Yeu</i> ([37] <i>supra</i>) at 191\u2013192:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Further, the expression of the first stage of the test [in <i>Anns</i>] carries with it a risk of misinterpretation. As Gibbs\u00a0C.J. pointed out in <i>Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman</i>, 59<i>\u00a0</i> A.L.J.R. 564, 570, there are two possible views of what Lord Wilberforce meant. The first view, favoured in a number of cases mentioned by Gibbs\u00a0C.J., is that he meant to test the sufficiency of proximity simply by the reasonable contemplation of likely harm. The second view, favoured by Gibbs\u00a0C.J. himself, is that Lord Wilberforce meant the expression \u201cproximity or neighbourhood\u201d to be a composite one, importing the whole concept of necessary relationship between plaintiff and defendant described by Lord Atkin in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> [1932] A.C.\u00a0562, 580<i>.</i> In their Lordships\u2019 opinion the second view is the correct one. As Lord Wilberforce himself observed in <i>McLoughlin v. O\u2019Brian</i> [1983] 1\u00a0A.C. 410, 420, it is clear that foreseeability does not of itself, and automatically, lead to a duty of care. There are many other statements to the same effect. The truth is that the trilogy of cases referred to by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</i> [1978] A.C.\u00a0728, 751, each demonstrate particular sets of circumstances, differing in character, which were adjudged to have the effect of bringing into being a relationship apt to give rise to a duty of care. Foreseeability of harm is a necessary ingredient of such a relationship, but it is not the only one. Otherwise there would be liability in negligence on the part of one who sees another about to walk over a cliff with his head in the air, and forbears to shout a warning.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Proximity</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>first</i> stage of the test to be applied to determine the existence of a duty of care is that of proximity, <i>ie</i>, that there must be sufficient <i>legal</i> proximity between the claimant and defendant for a duty of care to arise. The focus here is necessarily on the closeness of the relationship between the parties themselves, as alluded to by Bingham\u00a0LJ in the Court of Appeal stage of <i>Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman</i> [1989] QB\u00a0653, where he said (at 679) that while \u201c[t]he content of the requirement of proximity, whatever language is used, is not \u2026 capable of precise definition\u201d and \u201c[t]he approach will vary according to the particular facts of the case, \u2026 the focus of the inquiry is on the <i>closeness and directness of the relationship between the parties</i>\u201d [emphasis added]. Indeed, in <i>Hedley Bryne</i> ([44] <i>supra</i>) itself, the House of Lords used language which pointed to the relationship between the parties as being determinative of duty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although Lord\u00a0Keith in <i>Yuen Kun Yeu</i> referred (at 194) to the concept of \u201cclose and direct relations\u201d, he did not clarify what the concept means. However, in the Australian High Court decision of <i>Sutherland</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>), Deane\u00a0J has observed thus (at 55\u201356):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The requirement of proximity is directed to <i>the relationship between the parties</i> in so far as it is relevant to the allegedly negligent act or omission of the defendant and the loss or injury sustained by the plaintiff. It involves <i>the notion of nearness or closeness and embraces physical</i> proximity (in the sense of space and time) between the person or property of the plaintiff and the person or property of the defendant, <i>circumstantial</i> proximity such as an overriding relationship of employer and employee or of a professional man and his client and what may (<i>perhaps loosely</i>) be referred to as <i>causal</i> proximity in the sense of the closeness or directness of the causal connection or relationship between the particular act or course of conduct and the loss or injury sustained. It may reflect <i>an assumption by one party of a responsibility</i> to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the person or property of another or <i>reliance</i> by one party upon such care being taken by the other in circumstances where the other party knew or ought to have known of that reliance. <i>Both the identity and the relative importance of the factors which are determinative of an issue of proximity are likely to vary in different categories of case.</i> That does <i>not mean</i> that there is scope for decision by reference to idiosyncratic notions of justice or morality or that it is a proper approach to treat the requirement of proximity as <i>a question of fact to be resolved merely by reference to the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant in the particular circumstances.</i> The requirement of a relationship of proximity <i>serves as a touchstone and control of the categories of case in which the common law will adjudge that a duty of care is owed.</i> Given the general circumstances of a case in a new or developing area of the law of negligence, the question what (if any) combination or combinations of factors will satisfy the requirement of proximity is a <i>question of law to be resolved by the processes of legal reasoning, induction and deduction. On the other hand, the identification of the content of that requirement in such an area should not be either ostensibly or actually divorced from notions of what is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d \u2026 or from the considerations of public policy which underlie and enlighten the existence and content of the requirement.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We respectfully agree with this analysis which merely unpacks \u201cproximity or neighbourhood\u201d as a composite idea, importing the whole concept of the necessary relationship between the claimant and the defendant described by Lord\u00a0Atkin in <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> (at 580). However, in this regard, we also acknowledge that there are numerous judicial pronouncements on the difficulty (and indeed, redundancy) in defining \u201cproximity\u201d. Some of these examples have already been cited above and it suffices only to reproduce Lord\u00a0Oliver of Aylmerton\u2019s speech in <i>Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police</i> [1992] 1\u00a0AC 310, where he said (at 411):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]n the end, it has to be accepted that the concept of \u201cproximity\u201d is an artificial one which depends more upon the court\u2019s perception of what is the reasonable area for the imposition of liability than upon any logical process of analogical deduction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding these judicial views, we agree with Phang, Saw &amp; Chan ([26] <i>supra</i> at 42) that these observations are \u201cpuzzling, to say the least\u201d. If indeed the \u201cproximity\u201d concept is merely a label or an artificial exercise in judicial creativity, then one must ask why the concept is still resorted to or utilised in the various tests. Its very presence suggests that it has some substantive content that is capable of being expressed in terms of legal principles. Rather than denouncing it as a mere \u201clabel\u201d, the courts should strive to infuse some meaning into it, if only so that lawyers who advise litigants and even law teachers can make some sense of the judicial formulations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, Deane\u00a0J\u2019s analysis in <i>Sutherland</i>, that proximity includes physical, circumstantial as well as causal proximity, does provide substance to the concept since it includes the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance, where the facts support them, as essential factors in meeting the test of proximity. Where A voluntarily assumes responsibility for his acts or omissions towards B, and B relies on it, it is only fair and just that the law should hold A liable for negligence in causing economic loss or physical damage to B: see Phang, Saw &amp; Chan at 47, where the authors wrote:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[B]oth</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">perspectives are, at bottom, <i>two different (yet inextricably connected) sides of the same coin and ought therefore to be viewed in an integrated and holistic fashion</i>. [emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We only need to add, further, that in determining proximity as expounded by Deane\u00a0J in <i>Sutherland</i>, the court should apply these concepts first by analogising the facts of the case for decision with those of decided cases, if such exist, but should not be constrained from limiting liability in a deserving case only because it involves a novel fact situation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Policy considerations</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Assuming a positive answer to the preliminary question of factual foreseeability and the first stage of the legal proximity test, a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care arises. Policy considerations should then be applied to the factual matrix to determine whether or not to negate this duty. Among the relevant policy considerations would be, for example, the presence of a contractual matrix which has clearly defined the rights and liabilities of the parties and the relative bargaining positions of the parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also recognise that the obvious objection to utilising policy as the overarching determinant of liability is its potential to result in arbitrary decisions. Although it is generally recognised that public policy is an unruly horse (<i>per</i> Burrough\u00a0J in <i>Richardson v Mellish</i> (1824) 2\u00a0Bing 229 at 252; 130\u00a0ER 294 at 303), it cannot be <i>completely</i> ignored. The danger is <i>not</i> with judges deciding cases based on policy considerations but rather with judges deciding cases based <i>solely</i> on them. We agree with Prof\u00a0Tan ([29] <i>supra</i> at 228) that \u201c[t]he truth lies somewhere in between pure principle-based decisions and policy-based decisions\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is obviously impossible to decide cases <i>in vacuo</i>, exclusive of the interests and the context of the community for which the decisions are made\u201d. In our view, it is inescapable that some measure of public policy must be considered but it must not be the sole determinant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would also caution that when applying policy considerations to negate the imposition of a duty of care, the courts must be careful to differentiate such considerations from the requirement of proximity in the first stage of the test we have articulated. The courts must, as far as possible, avoid giving the impression that there remain \u201cunexpressed motives\u201d behind their finding for or against a duty. The courts must also not have litigants believe, as J\u00a0A\u00a0Smillie put it in \u201cThe Foundation of the Duty of Care in Negligence\u201d (1989) 15\u00a0Monash U L Rev\u00a0302 at 302, that \u201cnone of [the tests articulated by the courts] is truly explanatory of judges\u2019 reasoning or provides a helpful framework for analysis of the duty question\u201d. If there is truly a <i>pertinent and relevant</i> policy consideration involving value judgments which reflect differential weighing and balancing of competing moral claims and broad social welfare goals, we feel that it would be better if the courts were to articulate these concerns under the requirement of policy considerations, rather than subsume these concerns within the proximity requirement, which may then lead to an overall distortion of the legal test to determine the existence of a duty of care. In this respect, we agree with Nicholas\u00a0J\u00a0Mullany when he notes in \u201cProximity, Policy and Procrastination\u201d (1992) 9\u00a0Aust Bar Rev 80 at 83 that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Judges should openly express the true premises of their decisions and, if recovery is considered to be undeserved, in the light of greater moral, social, economic, administrative or philosophical public perceptions, then these reasons and not others inherently uncertain in nature, should be expressed as the true foundation for denial of recovery.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With these general propositions in mind, we turn now to the facts of the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><strong>Duty of care in the present case</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Foreseeability of damage</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The parties\u2019 arguments</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adopting the test which we have set out, the <i>threshold issue</i> was the foreseeability of damage to the appellant. In this respect, it contended that the respondent\u2019s responsibility under the PSSCOC, as the SO, included certification responsibilities under cl\u00a032. Given that payment to the appellant under the PSSCOC structure was entirely dependent on the issuance of payment certificates certified by the respondent, the appellant submitted that it must have been foreseeable to the respondent that any negligence in its certification would deprive the appellant of moneys he would otherwise have been entitled to.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response, the respondent contended that the appellant had not even crossed the low threshold of reasonable foreseeability as it was not even able to show that the damage allegedly suffered by it could have been foreseeable. In particular, it was argued that the appellant was in effect saying that the alleged under-certification led to its financial difficulties and these difficulties led to the need for it to novate the Contract. If it had not novated the Contract, it might still have been able to recover the amounts under-certified. In other words, the appellant had relied on the correctness of the interim certificates issued by the respondent in deciding to enter into the novation agreement. However, the respondent contended that it could not have reasonably foreseen that the appellant would rely on the said certificates for the novation given that the appellant had since 29\u00a0September 2000 been challenging the correctness of the respondent\u2019s certifications.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Our decision</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We rejected the respondent\u2019s submission that this factual requirement was not satisfied because the respondent could not have foreseen (essentially) the <i>kind of losses</i> suffered by the appellant. This is because the test envisaged by the respondent (<i>ie</i>, foreseeability of the <i>kind</i> of losses) is properly the test for the remoteness of damages in tort, and is not the test for factual foreseeability in relation to the duty of care: see <i>Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered Bank</i> <nobr>[2007] 2 SLR 181</nobr>. As such, the factual requirement of foreseeability was satisfied in this case because, as the appellant rightly pointed out, it must have been foreseeable to the respondent that any negligence in its certification would directly deprive the contractor of moneys he would otherwise have been entitled to, and that if it had been paid the correct amounts, it might not have got into financial difficulties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Proximity</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The parties\u2019 arguments</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issue of proximity obviously formed the main focus of contention between the parties, dominant as its role is in the determination of the existence of a duty of care (see [77] above). We therefore consider it useful to provide a closer analysis of the parties\u2019 arguments.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant\u2019s arguments</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant submitted that it, as the contractor in the Project, had to rely on the professional judgment of the respondent, as the certifier, in agreeing to enter into a PSSCOC form of contract, under which it was held out to the contractor that payment for work done in the correct amount would depend entirely on the respondent, as an independent certifier, discharging its duties professionally, <i>ie</i>, fairly and impartially. Specifically, the appellant pointed out that the respondent must have known that any certificate it issued for payment would determine the amount payable to the appellant under cl\u00a032 of the Contract. It was therefore unrealistic for the respondent to deny knowledge of the obvious reliance that would be placed on its certificate since it was not open for the appellant under the PSSCOC framework to obtain payment for work done by it in any other way.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further, the appellant referred to cl\u00a02.8 of the Contract as providing some specific indications of the respondent\u2019s assumption of responsibility towards the contractor. As we mentioned earlier (at [4] above), this clause states that the SO or any of its representatives \u201cshall at no time be under any obligation or duty to the Contractor either on behalf of the Employer or his own account to exercise or not to exercise any of his powers under the Contract\u201d. The appellant contended that, properly construed, this clause meant that it would only apply if the respondent did nothing, but not if he did something, and that once he decided to exercise his power under the Contract it must follow that he had assumed responsibility to the appellant to do it properly and professionally.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, the appellant pointed out that cl\u00a032.8 of the Contract made it clear that the appellant had no remedy <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the Employer for \u201cany damages, whether by way of interest or otherwise, for any failure or delay by the [SO] in certifying any payment due or payable to the Contractor\u201d. Since cl\u00a032.8 had severely limited any recourse by the appellant to the Employer for damages arising from any failure or delay by the respondent in certifying any payment due or payable to the contractor, it was argued that the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Pacific Associates Inc v Baxter</i> [1990] 1\u00a0QB 993 (\u201c<i>Pacific Associates</i>\u201d), which denied a duty of care in similar circumstances, was distinguishable as in that case there was no such restriction of the contractor\u2019s right of recourse to the employer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent\u2019s arguments</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent argued that the case was on all fours with <i>Pacific Associates</i> if the court took into account the existence of the appellant\u2019s right to arbitration under cl\u00a034 (see [5] above). It submitted that cl\u00a034 gave extensive rights to the appellant to submit disputes for arbitration including submitting a claim against the Employer for any under-certification by the respondent. As such, the respondent contended that, on the facts of the case, it could not be said that the SO had assumed any responsibility for the appellant for the consequences of any under-certification or that the appellant had relied solely on the respondent\u2019s certification to recover what was due to it for work done.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to the appellant\u2019s interpretation of cl\u00a02.8, the respondent submitted that it was wholly misconceived and that it actually meant the opposite. It was argued that cl\u00a02.8 referred not only to the absence of a duty to exercise the SO\u2019s powers, but also of a duty not to exercise them, which meant that the SO could exercise them, if he wished, which he had done. Finally, as regards cl\u00a032.8, the respondent submitted that while cl\u00a032.8 precluded the appellant from claiming against the Employer damages for the failure or delay of the respondent in certification, the appellant had the right to claim the amounts under-certified and interest thereon by commencing arbitration proceedings against the Employer. This was clear from a perusal of cll\u00a032 and 34.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately, the respondent submitted that, given the carefully drafted and detailed provisions governing the rights and liabilities of the Employer and the appellant which took into account the role of the respondent, it would be wrong for the court to impose a duty of care on it <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the appellant. If the appellant had wanted the respondent to assume some liability to it in discharging the respondent\u2019s duties to the Employer, it could have proposed a direct contractual arrangement with the respondent or introduce the respondent as a further party to the Contract but it chose not to do so. Alternatively, the appellant could have decided not to tender for the work since it knew or must have known about the contractual structure before it even submitted its bid.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Our decision</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adopting an incremental approach with respect to the requirement of proximity, we found the salient facts in <i>Pacific Associates</i> to be materially the same as those in the present case. The claimant in <i>Pacific Associates</i> was a contractor engaged in dredging work under the supervision of the defendant engineer who was retained by the employer. The claimant\u2019s contract with the employer contained clauses providing that the engineer would not be personally liable for acts under the contract and providing for the arbitration of disputes between the contractor and the employer. The contractor claimed that the geological information in the tender document issued by the engineer had under-estimated the amount of hard materials to be dredged and that the engineer had acted negligently in rejecting the contractor\u2019s claims for extra payment for removal of unforeseen hard materials. The contractor recovered some of its alleged losses from the employer following an arbitration settlement and then sought to recover the balance through a negligence action against the employer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Court of Appeal held (at 1032) that it would not be reasonable to impose a <i>Hedley Byrne</i> ([44] <i>supra</i>) duty on the engineer because it \u201cwould cut across and be inconsistent with the structure of relationships created by the contracts, into which the parties had entered\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reasonable reliance and assumption of responsibility</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court in <i>Pacific Associates</i> also held that the engineer did not owe a duty of care to a contractor who had suffered economic loss as a result of his decisions as the contractor was safeguarded by the terms of its contract with the employer. Purchas\u00a0LJ considered that the courts should be slow to superimpose an added duty of care in excess of the rights the contractor was content to acquire against the owner in those cases where the parties came under a contractual framework which provided for compensation in the event of the failure of one of the parties involved. On the question of <i>reliance</i>, Purchas\u00a0LJ held that if the contractor required extra-contractual protection for the defaults of the engineer, it was open to the contractor to stipulate for it when contracting. By accepting the invitation to tender the contractor must be taken to accept the role to be played by the engineer as defined in the contract. As such, the court could not accept that the engineer had held himself out as accepting a duty of care outside the contractual framework, or that the contractor had relied on such an assumption of responsibility. Purchas\u00a0LJ, however, noted that the position might have been different if the arbitration clause had not been included in that contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ralph Gibson\u00a0LJ gave a similar analysis. In his judgment, he noted that there was no <i>express or implied assumption of responsibility</i>, emphasising that there was no approach or request by the contractor inviting the provision of a service or advice or information directly to the engineer. The engineer\u2019s relationship with the contractor arose from the engineer\u2019s contract of employment with the owner. It was to the owner that the engineer owed his contractual duty to use proper care. Since the contract provided for correction by arbitration, the engineer was not employed to exercise due care in the interest of the contractor, so he could not be regarded as assuming responsibility to the contractor. The duty to act fairly and impartially was owed only to the employer. Essentially, Ralph Gibson\u00a0LJ denied the general duty on the grounds of both foreseeability (which he evidently regarded as a legal, as opposed to factual, requirement) and proximity, in view of the absence of voluntary assumption of responsibility.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, Russell\u00a0LJ, while reaching the same result, regarded the <i>policy</i> test as pivotal in the appeal. He thought that the engineer, in preparing tenders and contract documents, held himself out as an expert on whom the contractor was entitled to rely. However, on the policy test, he held that the contractor had freely entered into the contract and knew that a claim against the engineer must be ex-contractual. The contractor had its rights adequately protected by the contract with the owner and, had it thought the protection inadequate, it was at liberty to insist on a tri-partite contract. The parties having sought to regulate their relationships by contract, the law should be very cautious before grafting onto the contractual relationship what might be terms of a parasitic duty unnecessary for the parties\u2019 protection. In Russell\u00a0LJ\u2019s view, while the requirement of foreseeability and proximity might be satisfied, it was not just and reasonable that there should be imposed on the engineer a duty which the contractor chose not to make a contractual one because, <i>inter alia</i>, the arbitration clause provided an adequate remedy in the event of under-certification.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The core of the judgments, as Ian Duncan Wallace noted in \u201cCharter for the Construction Professional?\u201d (1990) 6\u00a0Const\u00a0LJ\u00a0207 at para\u00a013, lies in the view that, merely by virtue of the professional entering into a contract of employment under which he is to perform the various duties required by his client\u2019s contract with a contractor, and by so acting, it cannot be inferred as a fact that the professional (an engineer in <i>Pacific Associates</i>) has voluntarily assumed responsibility to the contractor for a careful discharge of his duties. As Ralph Gibson\u00a0LJ\u2019s judgment shows, only in circumstances in which the contractor makes some positive approach to the engineer for some service, advice, <i>etc</i>, followed by some positive statement or action on the part of the engineer on which it would be reasonable for the contractor to rely without further checking, may a voluntary assumption of responsibility be inferable.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other jurisdictions following Pacific Associates</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">103<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pacific Associates</i> has been followed in the Australian case of <i>John Holland Construction and Engineering Pty Ltd v Majorca Projects Pty Ltd</i> (2000) 16\u00a0Const\u00a0LJ 114 (\u201c<i>John Holland</i>\u201d). Byrne\u00a0J thought that the lowest common denominator in <i>Pacific Associates</i>, which prevented the court from finding a duty, was the arbitration clause. Regarding the duties of a certifier generally, Byrne\u00a0J had the following to say (at 125\u2013126):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">To my mind it is reasonably foreseeable that the decisions of a certifying architect might cause loss to a contractor in a conventional building project if made negligently. Whatever that loss might be will depend upon the nature of the decision in question; it is in any event pure economic loss. This foreseeability is not removed by a right to review the decision by arbitration. Insofar as an entitlement to payment is concerned, a contractor who is successful upon arbitration must necessarily incur the cost of that arbitration and may suffer a deferment of payment, perhaps without a right to interest pending payment ... Nor am I troubled by either of the examples of policy consideration referred to in <i>Bryan v. Moloney</i> [<i>sic</i>] (1995) 182\u00a0C.L.R. at 618\u20139 ... The Builder in this case is clearly an identifiable member of the limited class of two persons who must have been in the contemplation of the Architect as being directly affected by its decisions. It is not an affront to the standards expected of a professional person that he or she should exercise the onerous responsibilities of certifier with due care and without partiality or unfairness. I suspect that the community, and particularly those concerned in the building industry, would expect no less.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The solution to the present problem must be found in the answer to the questions whether, in the contractual framework in which the parties to this project operated, it is established that the Builder relied on or depended upon the careful and impartial performance by the Architect of its certifying functions as here alleged and whether the Architect, for its part, assumed legal responsibility to the Contractor so to perform them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Byrne\u00a0J went on to find (at 126), on the basis of the contractual background, that it was \u201cnot appropriate ... to seek to engraft upon the contractual background a tortious obligation\u201d. However, Byrne\u00a0J could see no policy reasons for not imposing a duty in appropriate circumstances and accordingly accepted that in principle a certifier had a duty to make \u201cdecisions which are professional, careful and even-handed, not in the interests of any one party\u201d (at 126). Further, Byrne\u00a0J expressed the view that the right to review an architect\u2019s decision by arbitration did not remove the foreseeability of economic loss being caused by a certifier\u2019s negligence. Seen in this light, the reasoning in <i>John Holland</i> appears to be tilted towards the <i>policy</i> aspect of the reasoning in <i>Pacific Associates</i>, as opposed to subsuming the ability of the contractor to seek recourse in arbitration under the rubric of \u201cproximity\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">105<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pacific Associates</i> has also been followed in the Hong Kong decision of <i>Leon Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd v Ka Duk Investment Co Ltd</i> (1989) 47\u00a0BLR 139, where the court refused to impose a duty on the professional on the ground that there was an adequate machinery under the contract for the contractor to pursue grievances, including those relating to under-certification, against the employer. At the close of the judgment, Bokhary\u00a0J said (at 151):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The principle which I extract from \u2026 <i>Pacific Associates ...</i> is one which I would state in these terms: Where, first, there is adequate machinery under the contract between the employer and a contractor to enforce the contractor\u2019s rights thereunder and, secondly, there is no good reason at tender stage to suppose that such rights and machinery would not together provide the contractor with an adequate remedy, then, in general, a certifying architect or engineer does not owe to the contractor a duty in tort coterminous with the obligation in contract owed to the contractor by the employer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Elsewhere, the effect of <i>Pacific Associates</i> has been distinguished, primarily on the basis that what the professional says or does before a contract is entered into is entirely different from what he does when he makes an interim certification of payment. However, it has never been expressly overruled and the legal principles which it stands for (as discussed above) remain good law, as far as we are aware, in all Commonwealth jurisdictions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Canadian Supreme Court in <i>Edgeworth Constructions Ltd v ND Lea &amp; Associates Ltd</i> (1993) 107\u00a0DLR (4th) 169 has held that there might be situations where a negligent statement by the professional in <i>preparing the tender documents</i> would lead to liability under <i>Hedley Byrne</i> ([44] <i>supra</i>) but, in the absence of such a statement to the contractor, it seemed unlikely that a court would find a duty of care based on the mere conduct of the professional. Similarly, in <i>J\u00a0Jarvis and Sons Ltd v Castle Wharf Developments Ltd</i> [2001] EWCA Civ\u00a019, the English Court of Appeal distinguished <i>Pacific Associates</i> and held that the professional agent of an employer could be liable to a contractor for negligent misstatements made by that agent to the contractor with the aim of inducing the contractor to tender, provided that the contractor placed reliance on those statements. The question of whether a duty of care had arisen was dependent on the given facts and, in particular, on what had been said to the contractor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Application to the present case</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Applying the findings in <i>Pacific Associates</i> in relation to proximity to the present case, we were of the opinion that the requirement of proximity was not satisfied. The trial judge at [79] of the Judgment stated that there was no assumption of direct responsibility by the respondent to the appellant, but did not explain <i>why</i> this was so. In view of the presence of the arbitration clause in the Contract, <i>ie</i>, cl\u00a034 (see [5] above) in the present case, it was not possible for this court to depart from the reasoning in <i>Pacific Associates</i> and hold that the respondent had a duty of care to the appellant to certify the payments for work done correctly. For this reason, we held that there was no legal proximity for a duty of care to arise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the arguments based on cl\u00a032.8, we were of the view that although the appellant had no remedy <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the Employer for \u201cany damages, whether by way of interest or otherwise, for any failure or delay by the [SO] in certifying any payment due or payable to the Contractor\u201d, thereby precluding the appellant from claiming damages against the Employer for failure or for delay of the respondent in certification, the appellant was always free to claim the amounts <i>under-certified</i> and interest thereon by arbitration proceedings against the Employer. This was clear from a perusal of cll\u00a032 and 34. In addition, cl\u00a022 specifically allowed the contractor to claim \u201cLoss and Expense\u201d against the Employer under many stated grounds. Hence, <i>Pacific Associates</i> was not distinguishable because of cl\u00a032.8.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to the effect of cl\u00a02.8, we accepted the respondent\u2019s argument as set out in [95] above.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Policy considerations</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In reaching our decision, we had also considered the parties\u2019 arguments on whether if there had been proximity, there would have been any policy considerations that would have persuaded us to deny any remedy to the appellant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The parties\u2019 arguments</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, the appellant first submitted that given the recognised and accepted position of the certifier having to be independent and impartial to both the employer and the contractor, it was logical that a duty of care be imposed on the certifier to ensure that he would discharge his duties professionally to all parties who might be affected by his certification. This would also help to improve the overall standards in the industry. To this submission, the respondent argued that it was merely speculative.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, the appellant stated that the trial judge\u2019s concern about opening the floodgates must be considered in its appropriate context. In particular, while there might be additional claims made (such as from sub-contractors), it was within the power of the courts to control the risk by recognising the appellant\u2019s claim and denying the other claims. In this case, the respondent\u2019s duties, certification and otherwise, were aimed at the party in direct contract with the Employer, <i>ie</i>, the main contractor, and there was no risk of indeterminate liability. The respondent\u2019s argument, in response, was that it would not be just or reasonable to impose a duty of care on the SO in view of the contractual framework to which the appellant had agreed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Our decision</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the facts of the present case, the same reasons above articulated by Russell\u00a0LJ in <i>Pacific Associates</i> can also be characterised as policy considerations under the second stage of the test in <i>Anns</i>. For the reasons considered above, <i>viz</i>, a duty of care should not be superimposed on a contractual framework, we considered that there were cogent policy reasons why, assuming that proximity was found, a duty of care should nonetheless <i>not</i> be imposed on the respondent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To recapitulate: A <i>single</i> test to determine the existence of a duty of care should be applied regardless of the nature of the damage caused (<i>ie</i>, pure economic loss or physical damage). It could be that a more restricted approach is preferable for cases of pure economic loss but this is to be done within the confines of a single test. This test is a two-stage test, comprising of, first, proximity and, second, policy considerations. These two stages are to be approached with reference to the facts of decided cases although the absence of such cases is not an absolute bar against a finding of duty. There is, of course, the threshold issue of factual foreseeability but since this is likely to be fulfilled in most cases, we do not see the need to include this as part of the <i>legal</i> test for a duty of care.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances, applying the two-stage test, we found that there was no duty of care as the appellant had contended for. As a result, we did not have to consider the additional issues of breach, causation and remoteness which had been canvassed before us. The appeal was dismissed with costs and with the usual consequential orders.</span></p>\n\n<div><br clear=\"all\"/>\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n<p

from the decision of the High Court dismissing the claim brought by the appellants, Projection Pte Ltd (`PPL`), against the respondents, The Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd (`Tai Ping`), for the sum of $553,560.98 based on a compromise agreement said to be made between the parties on 31 March 1999. The court in a reserved judgment held that no such agreement was made between them. PPL now appeal against that decision.<br/><br/><strong><i> The parties </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>PPL were a construction company and were employed by the Singapore Sports Council (`the Sports Council`) as the main contractors for a proposed sports and recreation centre to be constructed at Jurong East Street 31, Singapore (`the Project`). For the Project, PPL took out a Contractors` All Risks Policy (`the Policy`) with Tai Ping, which was valid from 13 June 1996 to 10 December 1999. PPL, the Sports Council and PPL`s sub-contractors were named as the assured in the Policy. In addition, Tai Ping furnished to the Sports Council on behalf of PPL a performance bond for an amount equivalent to 10% of the contract sum.<br/><br/><strong><i> The facts </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>On or about 8 July 1997, while PPL were carrying out the construction work, the retaining wall of the Project collapsed, causing damage to a canal belonging to a third party. PPL gave the requisite notice to Tai Ping and claimed under the Policy the loss occasioned by the damage. No claim, however, was made by the Sports Council. There were two sections in the Policy: Section I pertained to liability for material damage, while Section II pertained to third party liability. On or about 11 July 1997, Cunningham International Pte Ltd (`Cunningham`), a firm of loss adjusters, were appointed by Tai Ping to investigate the damage to the wall and canal.<br/><br/>Thereafter, there appeared to be no significant development in connection with this claim for more than a year since it arose. It is unclear when Cunningham completed their investigation, but only on or about 1 October 1998 did they come up with a quantification of the claim. On that day, they wrote a letter to PPL`s consultants, Francis Teo &amp; Associates, in which they assessed PPL`s claim in the sum of $679,065.95 and gave a breakdown of this figure. They qualified their assessment by stating expressly that it was `subject to the approval of the insurers, policy terms, conditions and exclusions`. A copy of this letter was sent to PPL. The figure was subsequently revised in Cunningham`s `Interim Report No 2` to Tai Ping dated 7 October 1998. They adjusted the claim to $679,066.09.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the reports of Cunningham, nothing appeared to have been done by Tai Ping in relation to the claim of PPL. Several requests for payment were made by PPL, but no payment was received by them from Tai Ping. In  particular, on 26 October 1998, PPL wrote to their brokers, OCW Insurance (Brokers) Pte Ltd (`OCW`) requesting the latter to assist in expediting the payment of the claim by Tai Ping. From time to time, PPL`s director, Mr Ong Poh Pieow (`Mr Ong`) telephoned one Mr Douglas Ong (`Douglas`) of OCW to enquire about the progress of the claim. No reply appeared to have been received from Tai Ping. On 11 November 1998, PPL themselves wrote to Tai Ping asking for payment of the assessed amount or the reasons for the non-payment. Arising from this letter, Douglas eventually informed Mr Ong that Tai Ping were processing the claim. PPL promptly wrote to Tai Ping on 21 November 1998, recording what Douglas had said and stating that they expected to receive the payment within the next few days. Unfortunately, no such payment came.<br/><br/>On or about 2 December 1998, Cunningham in their letter to Tai Ping further adjusted the claim to $523,912.68, `subject to liability being engaged under the policy`. The letter was substantially reproduced in Cunningham`s final report to Tai Ping dated 8 December 1998, in which they assessed the Section I loss (with 15% deductible) at $322,374.58 and the Section II loss at $296,483. In respect of the Section II loss, they took into consideration the report prepared in December 1998 by Harris &amp; Sutherland (Asia) (`H &amp; S`), the professional engineers engaged to investigate the cause of the damage to the canal and the retaining wall, and suggested that `the insured could bear 20% to 30% of the loss` and that `this would be subject to direct negotiation`. The quantification thus stood at $523,912.68 or $553,560.98 depending on whether PPL bore 30% or 20% of the Section II loss. Very soon thereafter, on 9 December 1998, Tai Ping wrote to the brokers, OCW, stating that they would pay PPL $523,912,68 on the claim and that before payment they would need a letter from the Sports Council confirming that they have no objection to the payment to be made to PPL. However, unknown to PPL, the Sports Council had, as early as 19 May 1998, requested Tai Ping to expedite payment of the claim to PPL `in order for the contractors to rectify the damages works as soon as possible to avoid further damages to the surrounding works and the canal lining`.<br/><br/>In response to Tai Ping`s proposal for payment of $523,912.68, PPL wrote to Tai Ping on 18 December 1998, enquiring the reasons for paying a sum which was less than the assessed amount notified to Francis Teo &amp; Associates and requesting for a breakdown of the assessment. Mr Ong also called Douglas several times to press for an early settlement of PPL`s claim. Douglas did not appear to have taken very effective actions or steps in pursuing the claim for PPL. Whatever Douglas might or might not have done, there was clearly no response from Tai Ping to PPL`s letter.<br/><br/>The representatives of the parties then met on 9 March 1999 over lunch for a discussion. PPL were represented by Mr Ong and two other directors, while Tai Ping were represented by their assistant general manager, Mr Richard Li Zheng Ming (`Mr Li`). Douglas of OCW was also present at the meeting. OCW were the agents for PPL. At this meeting, PPL requested Tai Ping to increase the settlement sum of $523,912.68. There was some dispute between the parties as to what precisely transpired at this meeting. But there was no dispute that the representatives of PPL requested Mr Li to increase the amount for a settlement. No agreement was reached at that meeting. Thereafter, sometime at the end of  March 1999, Douglas again requested Mr Li to increase the settlement offer and suggested that Tai Ping should adjust the proportion of the loss to be borne by PPL for the Section II claim.<br/><br/>On 31 March 1999, Tai Ping wrote to OCW referring to the previous correspondence and discussion and stating that they agreed to adjust the proportion of the Section II loss from 30% to 20% and that the final sum payable was $535,560.98. We shall revert to this letter in detail in a moment. In response, PPL signed and returned the discharge voucher to Tai Ping under cover of their letter of 8 May 1999, saying that they have no objection to signing the voucher in respect of the payment and that the Sports Council need not sign the discharge voucher on the ground that they were not the claimants but were only the nominee for the receipt of the moneys. In addition, PPL inserted the following words to the voucher: `This full and final settlement shall be limited to the aforesaid incident only.`<br/><br/>Despite repeated reminders and requests, PPL did not receive any payment or response from Tai Ping thereafter. In July 1999, Mr Li informed Mr Ong that Tai Ping had been legally advised to disclaim liability. He offered PPL $300,000 as a goodwill settlement which was rejected. On 25 August 1999, PPL`s solicitors wrote to Tai Ping demanding payment of $553,560.98. In response, Tai Ping wrote to PPL on 31 August 1999 rejecting the claim. Shortly thereafter, PPL commenced legal proceedings against Tai Ping, and on 27 September 1999, Tai Ping`s solicitors wrote to PPL`s solicitors withdrawing any offer of settlement that their clients had made.<br/><br/><strong><i> PPL`s claim </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>PPL claimed that a compromise agreement was made between the parties sometime in March 1999. In support, they relied on what transpired at the meeting on 9 March 1999 and on Tai Ping`s letter of 31 March 1999. They claimed that Tai Ping had breached the agreement by failing to pay PPL or the Sports Council the sum of $553,560.98 in full and final settlement of the claim. They averred that the parties met on 9 March 1999 to discuss the settlement sum and agreed on the sum of $553,560.98, or in the alternative that an agreement was concluded on 31 March 1999 with the receipt of Tai Ping`s letter on that date. PPL took the position that the parties had always been trying to settle the claim and were negotiating on the quantum of the loss on which the parties finally reached an agreement on 31 March 1999.<br/><br/><strong><i> Tai Ping`s defence </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In their defence, Tai Ping denied the claim of PPL. They averred that the damage occasioned was due to a design error and under the terms of the Policy they were not liable to indemnify PPL, and in this regard, they relied on the opinion of H &amp; S. With regard to the settlement, Tai Ping averred that, owing to the pressure exerted on them by PPL, they despatched the discharge voucher merely to placate PPL and in anticipation of a possible settlement, pending legal advice and the final reports from Cunningham and H &amp; S. In that respect, there was an assumption common to both parties that any settlement was premised on  the ground that Tai Ping were liable to indemnify PPL under the terms of the policy. This assumption turned out to be untrue, and there was therefore a fundamental mistake which rendered the alleged agreement void for want of consideration. Alternatively, Tai Ping averred that there was no agreement made between them and PPL, and that if their letter of 31 March 1999 constituted an offer, that offer was not accepted in accordance with its terms, which required the discharge voucher to be signed by both PPL and the Sports Council.<br/><br/><strong><i> The decision below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The trial judge found that no compromise agreement was reached at the meeting on 9 March 1999. Turning to Tai Ping`s letter of 31 March 1999 to PPL, she construed it as an offer, which was not accepted by PPL in that they returned the discharge form without obtaining the signature of the Sports Council and they amended the wording of the form. Thus, there was also no compromise agreement reached between the parties on 31 March 1999. The judge further held that PPL had not pleaded, nor had they shown, that consideration had been furnished for the compromise agreement. She accordingly dismissed PPL`s claim with costs.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before us, PPL do not dispute the judge`s finding that no compromise agreement was reached between the parties at the meeting on 9 March 1999. Mr Tan Liam Beng, counsel for PPL, submits that the parties had been in negotiation on the amount of the claim, and by their letter of 31 March 1999 Tai Ping finally agreed to the quantum on which the parties had been negotiating, and there was then concluded the compromise agreement; that the discharge voucher and contents thereof were not conditions precedent to the compromise agreement taking effect; and that PPL had furnished consideration for the compromise agreement.<br/><br/>The central issue before us is whether there was a compromise agreement reached between the parties on 31 March 1999. It is settled law that in determining whether the parties have reached agreement, the court applies the objective test. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Aircharter World v Kontena Nasional</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1999:3:1:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1999:3:1:\">  [1999] 3 SLR 1 </a> at [para ]30, Karthigesu JA, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Under this test, once the parties have to all outward appearances agreed in the same terms on the same subject-matter, then neither can, generally, rely on some unexpressed qualification or reservation to show that he had not in fact agreed to the terms to which he had appeared to agree. Such subjective reservations of one party, therefore, do not prevent the formation of a contract.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Similar observation was made by Yong Pung How CJ in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:2000:3:405:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:2000:3:405:\">  [2000] 3 SLR 405 </a> at [para ] 40:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... Indeed the task of inferring an assent and of extracting the precise moment, if at all there was one, at which a meeting of the minds between the parties may be said to have been reached is one of obvious difficulty, particularly in a case where there has been protracted negotiations and a considerable exchange of written correspondence between the parties. Nevertheless, <strong> the function of the court is to try as far as practical experience allows, to ensure that the reasonable expectations of honest men are not disappointed.  To this end, it is also trite law that the test of agreement or of inferring consensus ad idem is objective. Thus, the language used by one party, whatever his real intention may be, is to be construed in the sense in which it would reasonably be understood by the other</strong>. [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the present case, the parties were involved in continuing negotiations, either directly or through the broker, Douglas, over a period of time. In such cases, the traditional analysis of offer and acceptance is not really helpful in determining the true position. In this regard, we agree with the observation expressed by Lord Denning MR in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Port Sudan Cotton Co v Govindaswamy Chettiar &amp; Sons</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1977] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 5</font> at 10:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... I do not much like the analysis in the text-books of inquiring whether there was an offer and acceptance, or a counter-offer, and so forth. I prefer to examine the whole of the documents in the case and decide from them whether the parties did reach an agreement upon all material terms in such circumstances that the proper inference is that they agreed to be bound by those terms from that time onwards.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>His Lordship repeated, in substance, his observation in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Butler Machine Tool Co v Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England)</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1979] 1 All ER 965</font> at 968, where he said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I have much sympathy with the judge`s approach to this case. In many of these cases our traditional analysis of offer, counter-offer, rejection, acceptance and so forth is out-of-date. This was observed by Lord Wilberforce in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v AM Satterthwaite</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1974] 1 All ER 1015</font> at 1019-1020, [1975] AC 154 at 167. The better way is to look at all the documents passing between the parties and glean from them, or from the conduct of the parties, whether they have reached agreement on all material points, even though there may be differences between the forms and conditions printed on the back of them.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>A similar view was also expressed in <strong><i> Chitty on Contracts </i></strong> Vol 1 (27th Ed, 1994) at 2-017:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Continuing negotiations. When parties carry on lengthy negotiations, it may be hard to say exactly when an offer has been made and accepted. As negotiations progress, each party may make concessions or new demands and the parties may in the end disagree as to whether they had ever agreed at all. <strong> The court must then look at the whole correspondence and decide whether, on its true construction, the parties had agreed to the same terms. If so, there is a contract even though both parties, or one of them, had reservations not expressed in the correspondence.</strong> [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Compromise agreement </i>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Bearing these principles in mind, we now turn to consider the relevant facts relating to the negotiations between the parties. In this connection, the past correspondence passing between the parties, what transpired at the meeting they had on 9 March 1999, and finally Tai Ping`s letter of 31 March 1999, were of critical importance. We take as a convenient starting point the letter dated 1 October 1998 from Cunningham to PPL`s consultants, Francis Teo &amp; Associates, in which the former assessed the claim in the sum of $679,065.95, which was subsequently revised by them to $679,066.09. This was followed by requests made through OCW to settle this claim, but no response was forthcoming from Tai Ping. In their final report to Tai Ping dated 8 December 1998, Cunningham assessed the Sections I and II losses in the sums of $322,374.58 and  $296,483 respectively, and suggested that the insured `could bear 20% to 30% of the loss` and that `this would be subject to direct negotiation`. The final quantification stood at $523,912.68 or $553,560.98, depending whether PPL bore 30% or 20% of the Section II loss. Following that, Tai Ping on 9 December 1998 wrote to OCW stating that they would pay PPL $523,912.68. Their letter, in so far as material, stated:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>1 We will make payment to the insured, Projection Pte Ltd.

Thereafter, Mr Ong called Douglas many times asking for an early settlement of PPL`s claim. Apparently, there was no response from Tai Ping. Finally the parties met on 9 March 1999. At that meeting, Mr Ong requested for an increase in the amount offered by Tai Ping. No agreement was reached at the meeting. Thereafter, sometime near the end of March 1999, Douglas again requested Mr Li to increase the amount. On 31 March 1999, Tai Ping wrote to OCW as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We refer to the previous correspondence and discussion in the above connection.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We are pleased to advise that we agree to adjust the proportion borned [sic] by Insured under Section II, from 30% to 20% of the loss. After adjustment, the final figure payable is S$553,560.98.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We enclose herewith a Discharge for your onward transmission for Insured`s signature.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In our view, this letter has to be construed against the relevant factual matrix. First, as early as 9 December 1998, Tai Ping had conveyed to OCW, their unequivocal offer to pay PPL $523,912.68 on the claim. They requested for the Sports Council`s confirmation that they had no objection to the `payment arrangement` and also PPL`s `confirmation of their payment`. This was followed by PPL`s letter of 18 December 1998 expressing their surprise at the reduction of the proposed payment and seeking an explanation. The next significant development was the meeting of 9 March 1999. Obviously, it was called with a  view to negotiating a final settlement of the claim, and negotiations did take place at the meeting, and in the negotiations PPL were seeking an increase in the sum that Tai Ping had offered to pay. There was evidence both from Mr Ong and Mr Li that at that meeting, PPL requested Tai Ping to increase the settlement sum. It was common ground between the two witnesses that the higher sum of $553,560.98 for settlement was discussed at the meeting. Mr Ong testified that Mr Li said that $553,560.98 was the maximum sum which he could offer. Mr Li on his part also testified that PPL asked him to increase the offer from $523,912.68 to $553,560.98 which he rejected at the time. It was in evidence that PPL requested that the settlement sum be increased to $553,560.98, but that Tai Ping were unwilling to agree at that time. The trial judge found that no agreement to pay the increased sum was reached on 9 March 1999. Thereafter, at the end of March 1999, according to Mr Li, Douglas again broached the request for an increased settlement sum and suggested that Tai Ping reduce the proportion of loss to be borne by PPL under Section II of the Policy. Finally, came the crucial document. That was Tai Ping`s letter of 31 March 1999 in which they agreed to the increased sum of $553,560.98. It is significant that in that letter they first referred to `the previous correspondence and discussion` and then said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We are pleased to advise that <strong> we agree</strong> to adjust the proportion borned [sic] by Insured under Section II, from 30% to 20% of the loss. After adjustment, the final figure payable is S$553,560.98. [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Viewed against that background, it is abundantly clear to us that by the letter of 31 March 1999, Tai Ping <strong><i> agreed </i></strong> to increase the payment to $553,560.98 sought by PPL in settlement of their claim. In our judgment, with the receipt of that letter the parties had arrived at a clear compromise on the amount to be paid in settlement of PPL`s claim.<br/><br/><strong><i> Discharge voucher </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We next turn to consider the import and effect of the discharge voucher enclosed in Tai Ping`s letter of 31 March 1999. That letter referred to the discharge voucher in the following terms:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We enclose herewith a Discharge for your onward transmission for Insured`s signature.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Neither the letter nor the discharge voucher contained any language which suggested that the discharge voucher was intended as a condition of, or a condition precedent to, the agreement to pay the increased amount of $533,560.98. The voucher was no more than an acknowledgment of the receipt of the sum in full settlement of the claim, and, as is the common practice of insurance companies, was prepared in advance of the payment that had yet to be received. It is a procedure normally adopted by insurance companies as a follow-up to a settlement which they have agreed. It may well be a requirement imposed by Tai Ping that PPL and the Sports Council should sign the discharge voucher before the payment is made. But whatever may be their requirement, the execution of the voucher by the parties as requested was certainly not a term or condition of the compromise agreement. Even if it was such a term or condition, it would have effect only on the implementation of the agreement, namely the payment of the  sum thereunder; it could not have any effect on the validity or existence of the agreement.<br/><br/>One of the objections taken by Tai Ping to the discharge voucher signed by PPL was the insertion of the words: `This full and final settlement shall be limited to the aforesaid incident only` made by PPL. It appears that there was a second incident which occurred at the site on 1 May 1999, leading to the lodging of a further claim under the Policy. The preceding correspondence and negotiations, however, only pertained to the incident of 8 July 1997. It seemed to us that the insertion of the additional sentence was merely a prudent measure which served to clarify that the settlement was limited to the first incident and would not prejudice or waive PPL`s rights in relation to other claims under the Policy. At any rate, we do not see how these words inserted by PPL in the discharge voucher could be construed as materially changing the substance or the effect of Tai Ping`s agreement to pay the sum as stated in the letter.<br/><br/><strong><i> The Sports Council </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We need to say a word on the Sports Council`s role in the settlement. Under the policy PPL, the Sports Council and PPL`s sub-contractor were named as the parties insured. It is implicit there that these parties were insured according to their respective rights and interests in the Project. In respect of the claim in question, neither the Sports Council nor the sub-contractor of PPL had any interest in it, and neither of the parties had submitted any claim either. In particular, the Sports Council have not given any notice of a claim, and is not, and has never been, a claimant of any part of the sum claimed by PPL in respect of the incident. In the circumstances, Tai Ping`s professed concern that the Sports Council may make a claim for the same incident in the future has no basis whatsoever. The communications between Tai Ping, Cunningham, PPL and OCW up to 31 March 1999 did not involve the Sports Council at all. If Tai Ping`s real concern was that, in view of the loss payee clause, they had to seek confirmation from the Sports Council for the payment to be made direct to PPL instead of the Sports Council, that confirmation was already in hand long ago. The Sports Council had as early as 19 May 1998 requested Tai Ping to expedite payment of the claim to PPL; by necessary implication they had directed payment to be made to PPL. If the excuse of Tai Ping then is that the direction was given long ago and might be out of date, and that a fresh confirmation should now be obtained, there is nothing to prevent them from obtaining it. That again relates to implementation of the settlement and has no effect whatsoever on the validity or existence of the settlement. The reference by Tai Ping to the Sports Council in defence of PPL`s claim was indeed a pure red herring.<br/><br/><strong><i> Consideration for the compromise agreement </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We next turn to the question of consideration. Mr Low Tiang Hock, counsel for Tai Ping, contends that there was no consideration provided by PPL for the compromise agreement in light of H &amp; S`s opinion that the incident was caused by a faulty design of the retaining wall and foundations, and therefore the damage was not covered by the Policy. This contention has no merit and we have no  hesitation in rejecting it. First, whatever may be the opinion of H &amp; S as to the cause of the damage, that opinion has not been tested and accepted in court; nor has it been accepted by PPL. In this case, the cause of the collapse was a question of fact which needed to be investigated, and the question of liability under the Policy would also depend on the construction of the various terms of the Policy. Both the cause of the collapse of the wall and the question of liability under the Policy remain untested, and they were not in issue.<br/><br/>The case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Magee v Pennine Insurance Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1969] 2 QB 507</font> relied upon by Mr Low is of no assistance here. In that case, a compromise agreement entered into for settling a claim was set aside on the ground that in entering into the agreement both parties were under a common fundamental mistake that the plaintiff had a valid claim under the insurance policy when he had not. In this case, there was no such `common fundamental mistake`.<br/><br/>The arguments put forward on behalf of Tai Ping confuses the success of the claim under the Policy with the validity of the compromise agreement. In this regard, we find salutary the decision of the Privy Council on appeal from Sri Lanka in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Jayawickreme v Amarasuriya (since deceased)</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1918]  AC 869</font>. There, the appellants instituted an action against the deceased respondent to recover a sum of money as balance due to the first appellant under an agreement made in compromise of a claim based on an alleged trust, in respect of which legal proceedings had been threatened. In allowing recovery of the money claimed, Lord Atkinson said at p 873:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It is plain from these passages that the decision of the District Judge was based upon the view that the compromise could not be supported, because the alleged trust which the female plaintiff threatened to enforce by action was not a valid trust enforceable in law, nor a <strong> justa causa debendi. He thus permitted himself to be led astray by the form of the pleading and the issue from determining whether the alleged compromise which it was sought by the suit before him to enforce was valid into that of determining whether the threatened suit alleged to have been compromised could have succeeded if prosecuted to its end - a wholly different and irrelevant question</strong>. The legal validity or invalidity of the claim the female plaintiff threatened to enforce by action is entirely beside the point if she, however mistakenly bona fide, believed in its validity. [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Secondly, at the time when the compromise agreement was reached, PPL had a claim against Tai Ping under the Policy and it had not been established in court that it was not a valid claim. From PPL`s perspective, from the time the claim was lodged up to the time of the compromise agreement, there was nothing on the evidence, which suggested that the claim was hopeless, frivolous or vexatious or was doomed to fail. The claim for the loss that was occasioned was potentially covered under the terms of the Policy. The agreement concluded was that Tai Ping agreed to pay the sum of $553,560.98 in full settlement of the claim. We do not see how it can ever be contended on behalf of Tai Ping that PPL had not provided any consideration for this compromise.<br/><br/>In the result, we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment below. There will be judgment for PPL against Tai Ping in the sum of $553,560.98. We now turn to the question of interest. The compromise agreement was made on 31 March 1999. Assuming that it was reasonable for Tai Ping to await the receipt of the discharge voucher duly signed by PPL before they made the payment, that document was  signed and returned to them on 8 May 1999, and they should have made the payment by 15 May 1999. They did not. We therefore order that they pay interest on the sum of $553,560.98 at 6% per annum from 16 May 1999 to the date hereof. We direct that the judgment sum and interest thereon, and also the statutory interest accruing on this judgment be paid to the Sports Council pursuant to the `loss payee` clause as provided in the Policy, unless prior to such payment, PPL furnish to Tai Ping or their solicitors a written direction from the Sports Council to the effect that the payment may be made to PPL.<br/><br/>The costs should follow the event, and we award to PPL the costs here and below. The deposit in court, with interest, if any, is to refunded to PPL or their solicitors.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n

lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Republic of the Philippines (\u201cthe Appellant\u201d) has appealed against the decision of Kan Ting Chiu\u00a0J (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) dismissing its application in Summons No\u00a03874 of 2006 (\u201cthe Stay Application\u201d) to stay the interpleader proceedings in Originating Summons No\u00a0134 of 2004 (\u201cthe Interpleader Summons\u201d) on the basis of state immunity (see <i>WestLB AG v Philippine National Bank</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 967</nobr> (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d)).</span></p>\n\n<p

interpleader proceedings concern competing claims to certain moneys (\u201cthe Funds\u201d) which are held in an escrow account in the name of Harry Elias Partnership (\u201cHE&amp;P\u201d), the solicitors for Philippine National Bank (\u201cPNB\u201d), for the credit of the said proceedings. The Funds were originally held in escrow in PNB\u2019s account with WestLB\u00a0AG, Singapore (\u201cWLB\u201d) pending the determination of the ownership of or the title to the Funds by the courts of the Philippines, upon which event the escrow would automatically terminate. On 15\u00a0July 2003, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ordered that the Funds be forfeited to the Appellant on the ground that they were the ill-gotten gains of the former President of the Philippines, the late Ferdinand E\u00a0Marcos, and Mrs\u00a0Imelda R\u00a0Marcos.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, before WLB could release the Funds to PNB as the account holder, eight other claimants notified WLB of their claims to the Funds on various grounds. As a result, WLB took out the Interpleader Summons to interplead the conflicting claims of the nine claimants. PNB was named as the first defendant in the Interpleader Summons. Five foundations, <i>viz</i>, the Maler Foundation, the Avertina Foundation, the Palmy Foundation, the Vibur Foundation and the Aguamina Corporation (collectively referred to as \u201cthe Foundations\u201d), which are the first to fifth respondents in this appeal, were named as the second to sixth defendants. The seventh defendant in the Interpleader Summons (the sixth respondent in this appeal) is collectively the plaintiffs in the <i>Estate of Ferdinand E\u00a0Marcos Human Rights Litigation</i> in Case No.\u00a0MDL840-R in the United States District of Hawaii (\u201cthe HR Claimants\u201d), who had obtained damages from the Hawaiian district court on 3\u00a0February 1995. The eighth and the ninth defendants have withdrawn from the interpleader proceedings and are not parties to this appeal. Hereafter in this judgment, the Foundations and the HR Claimants will be referred to collectively as \u201cthe Respondents\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>How and why the Funds came to be deposited in Singapore</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Funds (which at this time amounted to about US$25m inclusive of interest) were originally part of a larger pool of assets (\u201cthe Marcos assets\u201d) held in the Swiss bank accounts of the Foundations. They came under the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts in rather unusual circumstances. The journey began on 28\u00a0February 1986, two days after former President Ferdinand E\u00a0Marcos and his family fled the Philippines, when the Appellant set up a commission called the \u201cPresidential Commission on Good Government\u201d (\u201cPCGG\u201d) to recover \u201c[all the] ill-gotten wealth accumulated by former President Ferdinand E.\u00a0Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates, whether located in the Philippines or abroad\u201d</span><a id=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 1]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">during his presidency. Some of the assets in question were the Marcos assets, which, as at 31\u00a0January 2002, amounted to more than US$658m with accrued interest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The PCGG sought the assistance of the Swiss authorities to recover the Marcos assets from the Foundations. On 24\u00a0March 1986, the Swiss Federal Council issued an interim order freezing the Marcos assets pursuant to a Swiss federal law, <i>viz</i>, the International Mutual Assistance for Criminal Matters Act (\u201cIMAC\u201d), in anticipation of a formal request from the Appellant for assistance under the IMAC. Such assistance was formally sought on 7\u00a0April 1986. Pursuant to the procedures under the IMAC, the investigating magistrates in the Swiss cantons of Zurich, Fribourg and Geneva issued freezing orders against the Marcos assets between April 1986 and January 1990.

On receipt of those assets, PNB deposited them in various banks in Singapore which had S&amp;P ratings of at least \u201cAA\u201d. One such bank was WLB.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some years prior to the repatriation of the Marcos assets but after the Swiss Federal Court\u2019s order of 21\u00a0December 1990 (see [6] above), the Appellant had, on 17\u00a0December 1991, petitioned the Sandiganbayan for the forfeiture of the Marcos assets (\u201cthe forfeiture proceedings\u201d) on the ground that they were ill-gotten wealth under the law of the Philippines. The defendants in the forfeiture proceedings (\u201cthe FP Defendants\u201d) were the Marcos Estate and Imelda Marcos. On 18\u00a0October 1993, the FP Defendants filed their answers to the claim. Three years later, on 18\u00a0October 1996, the Appellant applied for summary judgment. The application was dismissed. Another application for summary judgment was filed on 10\u00a0March 2000 and, on 19\u00a0September 2000, the Sandiganbayan declared that the Marcos assets (then held by PNB as the escrow agent) were ill-gotten wealth and were to be forfeited to the Appellant. The FP Defendants filed an application for reconsideration and the Sandiganbayan reversed its decision on 31\u00a0January 2002. The Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which, on 15\u00a0July 2003, reversed the decision of the Sandiganbayan and ordered the Marcos assets (which included the Funds) to be forfeited to the Appellant (\u201cthe Forfeiture Order\u201d) (see [2] above). This decision was affirmed by the Full Bench of the Supreme Court on 18\u00a0November 2003 as it was satisfied that there was conclusive evidence that the Foundations were only the nominees for the late Ferdinand Marcos and/or Imelda Marcos and/or their children.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following the making of the Forfeiture Order, PNB secured the repayment of the Marcos assets from the various banks in Singapore with which it had deposited the assets. In this connection, PNB instructed WLB to repay the approximately US$100m deposited with it (which was held in different deposit accounts with different maturity dates) to the Appellant as and when the deposits matured. The bulk of the assets deposited with WLB, amounting to about US$75m, were released to the Appellant on 25\u00a0August 2003. However, PNB was unable to obtain the release of the remaining sum (<i>ie</i>, the Funds) from WLB. As a result, PNB gave notice of termination of the remaining deposit accounts on 10\u00a0September 2003 for value on 11\u00a0September 2003. However, WLB could not return the Funds to PNB on 11\u00a0September 2003 as the HR Claimants had notified WLB of their claim against the Funds on 10\u00a0September 2003. Subsequently, the Foundations as well as the eighth and the ninth defendants also notified WLB of their claims to the Funds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 22\u00a0January 2004, the Sandiganbayan issued a writ of execution for the transfer to the Appellant of those of the Marcos assets held by PNB and deposited with WLB. Effectively, this execution order affected only the Funds (then amounting to about US$22m), which remained unpaid by WLB. The legal effect of this execution order in relation to the status of the Funds or PNB as the escrow agent was not adverted to in the stay proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two events which have a bearing on the issues in this appeal occurred a few days before the filing of the Interpleader Summons on 30\u00a0January 2004. On 27\u00a0January 2004, the PCGG passed resolution no\u00a02004-Y-001 (\u201cResolution No\u00a02004-Y-001\u201d) authorising PNB to retain \u201cUS$1-Million to cover the litigation and administrative costs to be incurred in the recovery and transfer to the Republic of the Philippines of the account in the bank in Singapore\u201d. Two days later, the PCGG passed resolution no\u00a02004-Y-002 dated 29\u00a0January 2004, which increased the amount of US$1m to 5% of the amount recovered. These resolutions (collectively referred to as \u201cthe PCGG Resolutions\u201d) were passed in anticipation of litigation with respect to the Funds, which WLB had refused to pay to PNB.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The Interpleader Summons</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24\u00a0March 2004, the court granted WLB\u2019s application in the Interpleader Summons without any objection from either PNB or the Appellant, which was fully aware of the application. The court also ordered the Funds to be transferred to an escrow account in the name of PNB\u2019s then solicitors, Drew &amp; Napier\u00a0LLC (\u201cD&amp;N\u201d), \u201cfor the credit of these proceedings\u201d.</span><a id=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 2]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">However, the court did not remove PNB as the escrow agent (and this would be consistent with the principle of comity as PNB had been appointed as such by agreement between the Appellant and the Swiss authorities). As such, D&amp;N (and later HE&amp;P) presumably held the Funds as PNB\u2019s nominee, but subject to the control of the court for the credit of the interpleader proceedings. Subsequently, the court ordered the parties to the Interpleader Summons to file affidavits to set out their respective positions as to why they claimed to be entitled to the Funds. Only PNB and the HR Claimants filed affidavits setting out their respective claims and the background facts relating to the Appellant\u2019s claim to the Funds. The Foundations do not appear to have gone on affidavit as to their positive claims to the Funds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Interlocutory applications:</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Forum non conveniens<em>and other matters</em></span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, the parties applied for and obtained various interlocutory orders from the court.

At the hearing of SIC\u00a04231/05 on 21\u00a0October 2005, HE&amp;P (which had, by then, replaced D&amp;N as PNB\u2019s solicitors) made a further application that the court should also determine the validity of the adverse claims of the Respondents. The court declined to do so and proceeded to hear PNB\u2019s application that the interpleader proceedings should be stayed on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens.</i> The court dismissed the application after hearing extensive submissions from counsel.

Instead, it was a prayer for a consequential or an ancillary order that would facilitate the court in releasing the Funds to the Appellant should the court stay the interpleader proceedings on the basis of state immunity. The order sought in Prayer\u00a02 was consequential in nature because, in the event of the proceedings being stayed, the court would have nothing more to do after staying the proceedings except to release the Funds to the Appellant in order to close the proceedings. (In the course of his argument in the court below, counsel withdrew Prayer\u00a02 in order to avoid any further confusion as the Appellant took the view that prayer\u00a04 of the Stay Application (see [20] above) was wide enough to cover the relief sought in Prayer\u00a02.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The Judge\u2019s findings and decision</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge held that it was not necessary for him to decide whether the Forfeiture Order had the effect of vesting the beneficial interest in the Funds in the Appellant. Instead, for the purpose of deciding whether the Appellant was entitled to stay the interpleader proceedings on the basis of state immunity, it was only necessary to determine whether the Appellant\u2019s claim to the Funds was \u201cnot merely illusory, nor founded on a title manifestly defective\u201d, applying the test laid down by the Privy Council (<i>per</i> Earl\u00a0Jowitt at 89\u201390) in <i>Juan Ysmael &amp; Company Incorporated v Government of the Republic of Indonesia</i> [1955] AC\u00a072 (\u201c<i>Juan Ysmael</i>\u201d). For this reason, the Judge declined to consider the Respondents\u2019 arguments as to whether the Forfeiture Order was an <i>in personam</i> or <i>in rem</i> judgment, whether it was penal in nature and whether it was binding on or enforceable against the Respondents. He held that these were substantive issues which would have to be addressed at the substantive hearing of the Interpleader Summons should the interpleader proceedings proceed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Applying the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> standard of proof, the Judge held that the Appellant\u2019s claim based on the Forfeiture Order was not illusory or manifestly defective and that the Appellant had established a sufficient standing to apply to stay the proceedings. However, he dismissed the Stay Application on the ground that the Appellant had, by its agent, PNB, and by its own conduct, submitted to the jurisdiction of the court (see the Judgment at [71]). It is not clear whether, by this decision, the Judge meant that <i>but for</i> the finding that the Appellant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, he would have stayed the interpleader proceedings. The Respondents have submitted on appeal that the Judge only decided that the Appellant had shown that it had a sufficient interest in the Funds to <i>apply</i> for a stay, but that does not mean that that interest is a sufficient basis for a stay to be <i>granted</i>. In the context of this case and having regard to our reasoning, we cannot see the difference between the two (<i>ie</i>, the interest which is sufficient to apply for a stay and the interest which is sufficient to warrant the grant of a stay) as it seems pointless for the court to divide the application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity in the context of stay applications in this way. Proof of an interest in property in the nature of a debt or chose in action which is sufficient to apply for a stay is, in our view, sufficient to stay the proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The issues and arguments on appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issues and arguments presented by the parties in this appeal are substantially the same as those considered by the Judge.

It raises the question of whether sovereign immunity may be asserted by a state against intangible property in the nature of debts or choses in action (such as the Funds) which are in the possession or control of a third party, that is to say, a party which is not an agent or a trustee of the state. It also raises policy and practical considerations as to the ultimate disposal of such property where the third party is unwilling to release the property to the state on account of conflicting claims having been made against the property. In the present case, the situation is even more unusual in that the Funds are under the control of the court (see [14] above). Issues\u00a0(b) and (c) are questions of fact, whilst issue\u00a0(d) is one of law and fact.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before we consider each of these issues, we propose to first describe the legal positions of the respective parties with regard to the Funds as this is important for a full appreciation of the legal issues. We will then discuss the principles of law on sovereign immunity in the context of stay applications and, in the light of the applicable principles, evaluate the rival arguments of the parties before concluding with our findings on these issues.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The parties\u2019 respective legal positions on the Funds</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PNB has at all times been the escrow agent holding the Funds pending their restitution or forfeiture pursuant to the final and binding judgment of a competent Philippines court. The Appellant has always claimed that it is beneficially entitled to the Funds or that the Funds should be returned to it as they are the ill-gotten gains of the late Ferdinand Marcos and/or Imelda Marcos under the law of the Philippines. The Respondents assert that the Appellant appointed PNB as its agent to recover the Funds and that PNB so acted in the interpleader proceedings, but this is denied by the Appellant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal relationship between PNB, as the depositor of the Funds and the original account holder, and WLB, as the depositee bank, was originally that of creditor and debtor. As such, PNB had the legal title to the Funds and was entitled to immediate repayment of the Funds as and when the deposits matured.

The court will stay any such action if state immunity is invoked. These principles are now contained in s\u00a03 of the SIA, which provides as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">General immunity from jurisdiction.</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3.</span></b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2014(1) A State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore except as provided in the following provisions of this Part [<i>ie</i>, Pt\u00a0II of the SIA].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A court shall give effect to the immunity conferred by this section even though the State does not appear in the proceedings in question.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Sovereign or state immunity issues are not new to the courts of Singapore, but they are rare. The last occasion on which a sovereign asserted immunity to proceedings in a Singapore court occurred in the Privy Council case of <i>Sultan of Johore v Abubakar Tunku Aris Bendahar</i> [1952] AC\u00a0318 (\u201c<i>Sultan of Johore</i>\u201d), where it was held that the then Sultan of Johor had submitted to the jurisdiction of our courts. Although the court\u2019s jurisdiction to stay proceedings against a state on the basis of state immunity is set out in the SIA, the common law continues to apply to determine when a court will recognise sovereign immunity in any particular case. The present appeal raises specific issues on the scope of sovereign immunity which are novel in that they have not been directly decided by any common law court (although persuasive <i>dicta</i> are found in some of the decisions of the House of Lords discussed at [35]\u2013[36] below).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The doctrine of state immunity is founded on the concept of the equality, independence and dignity of states and the principle that an equal has no authority over another equal: see the United States Supreme Court decision of <i>The Schooner Exchange v McFaddon</i> 11\u00a0US 116 (1812). In <i>Juan Ysmael</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>),Earl\u00a0Jowitt said (at 86) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The basis of the rule is that it is beneath the dignity of a foreign sovereign government to submit to the jurisdiction of an alien court, and that no government should be faced with the alternative of either submitting to such indignity or losing its property.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Compania Naviera Vascongado v Steamship Cristina</i> [1938] AC\u00a0485 (\u201c<i>The Cristina</i>\u201d), Lord\u00a0Atkin stated the principle as follows (at 490):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The foundation for the application to set aside the writ and arrest of the ship is to be found in two propositions of international law engrafted into our domestic law which seem to me to be well established and to be beyond dispute. The first is that the courts of a country will not implead a foreign sovereign, that is, they will not by their process make him against his will a party to legal proceedings whether the proceedings involve process against his person or seek to recover from him specific property or damages.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The second is that they will not by their process, whether the sovereign is a party to the proceedings or not, seize or detain property <i>which is his or of which he is in possession or control</i>. There has been some difference in the practice of nations as to possible limitations of this second principle as to whether it extends to property only used for the commercial purposes of the sovereign or to personal private property. In this country it is in my opinion well settled that it applies to both.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is implicit in the statements of both Earl\u00a0Jowitt and Lord\u00a0Atkin that the sovereign state must produce some evidence to show, and not merely assert, that it <i>has</i> an interest in or title to the property in question.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following cases illustrate how the principles of sovereign immunity have been applied by the English courts:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>The</i> <i>Cristina</i>, the House of Lords stayed an action by the plaintiff, a Spanish company, against the defendant, the Spanish government, for the return of a ship registered in the plaintiff\u2019s name on the ground that the ship had been requisitioned by Spain for a public purpose and had been placed under the charge of a master appointed by Spain. The House of Lords held that as the ship was in the possession and control of Spain through the master, Spain was indirectly impleaded and the action must be stayed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>United States of America and Republic of France v Dollfus Mieg et Cie\u00a0SA and Bank of England</i> [1952] AC\u00a0582 (\u201c<i>Dollfus Mieg</i>\u201d), a French company (\u201cDollfus Mieg\u201d) sued the Bank of England (\u201cBOE\u201d) for the return of 64 gold bars which the company claimed had been wrongfully seized from it by the Nazi government. The gold bars were subsequently recovered by the governments of the United States, France and the United Kingdom (\u201cthe three States\u201d), which then delivered the gold bars to BOE to hold as a bailee. BOE sold 13 of the 64 gold bars (\u201cthe 13 gold bars\u201d) by mistake, but retained the remaining 51 gold bars (\u201cthe 51 gold bars\u201d). Where Dollfus Mieg\u2019s claim for the 51 gold bars was concerned, it was held that the three States, as bailors, were entitled to immediate possession of those gold bars, which was as good as having legal possession thereof, and, accordingly, the three States were indirectly impleaded by Dollfus Mieg\u2019s claim. The House of Lords thus ordered the action in respect of the 51 gold bars to be stayed even though the three States were unable to obtain delivery of those gold bars without suing BOE (which was unwilling to return the gold bars to the three States because of Dollfus Mieg\u2019s claim) and thereby submitting to the jurisdiction of the English courts. (The action in respect of the 13 gold bars was, however, allowed to proceed on the ground that BOE, in selling those gold bars, had terminated the bailment.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Rahimtoola v Nizam of Hyderabad</i> [1958] AC\u00a0379 (\u201c<i>Rahimtoola</i>\u201d), the Nizam of Hyderabad (\u201cthe Nizam\u201d) sued the High Commissioner of the State of Pakistan (\u201cRahimtoola\u201d) and an English bank (\u201cWestminster Bank\u201d) to recover money which the Nizam claimed had been wrongfully transferred from his account with Westminster Bank to Rahimtoola. The House of Lords dismissed the action against Rahimtoola on the ground of sovereign immunity, holding that the money had been paid to Rahimtoola as the agent of Pakistan and not in his personal capacity. The action against Westminster Bank was also stayed on the ground that it impleaded Pakistan\u2019s title to the money in dispute and Pakistan\u2019s possession or control thereof through Rahimtoola. (In that case, Pakistan had both possession and control of the money through Rahimtoola.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In all three cases mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the states in question were able to prove that the properties to which they claimed title were in the possession and/or control of their agents, or, in the case of <i>Dollfus Mieg</i>, in the possession of their bailees, against whom they were entitled to immediate possession. The issue that arises in the present appeal is whether a sovereign state which can show an <i>arguable</i> claim to an interest in property, but which does not have control or possession of that property through an agent or a trustee, is entitled to assert immunity to stay any proceedings in which an adverse claim is made against the property. The English judges are divided on this question, although they generally agree that the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not absolute under English law and that it should not be extended unnecessarily: see <i>The Cristina</i> at, <i>inter alia</i>, 494, 498, 515 and 521\u2013522. For instance, the English Court of Appeal decided in <i>Trendtex Trading Corporation v Central Bank of Nigeria</i> [1977] QB\u00a0529 that the commercial acts of a foreign state were not immune from the jurisdiction of the English courts. This principle is now enacted in s\u00a05 of the SIA.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The standard of proof required to assert state immunity</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Juan Ysmael</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>), the Privy Council (<i>per</i> Earl\u00a0Jowitt) laid down the test on the requisite degree of proof which a state has to satisfy in order to assert immunity (\u201cthe <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test\u201d). At 87, Earl\u00a0Jowitt said:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where the foreign sovereign State is directly impleaded the writ will be set aside, but where the foreign sovereign State is not a party to the proceedings, but claims that it is interested in the property to which the action relates and is therefore indirectly impleaded, a difficult question arises as to how far the foreign sovereign government must go in establishing its right to the interest claimed. Plainly if the foreign government is required as a condition of obtaining immunity to prove its title to the property in question the immunity ceases to be of any practical effect.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Earl\u00a0Jowitt continued at 89\u201390 (see also [24] above):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In their Lordships\u2019 opinion the view of Scrutton L.J. [in <i>The Jupiter</i> [1924] P 236] that a mere assertion of a claim by a foreign government to property [which is] the subject of an action compels the court to stay the action and decline jurisdiction is against the weight of authority, and cannot be supported in principle. In their Lordships\u2019 opinion <i>a foreign government claiming that its interest in property</i> will be affected by the judgment in an action to which it is not a party, is <i>not bound as a condition of obtaining immunity to prove its title to the interest claimed, but it must produce evidence to satisfy the court that its claim is not merely illusory, nor founded on a title manifestly defective.</i> The court must be satisfied that conflicting rights have to be decided in relation to the foreign government\u2019s claim. When the court reaches that point it must decline to decide the rights and must stay the action, but it ought not to stay the action before that point is reached. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Should the</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Juan Ysmael <em>test be applied in the present case?</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Juan Ysmael</i> (at 84), counsel for the Republic of Indonesia submitted that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There does not appear to be one case in the books in which a sovereign has been required to prove his title, or in which after a decision had been taken as to title there would have been anything left to litigate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This submission provided some degree of support to the test ultimately laid down by Earl\u00a0Jowitt. Nevertheless, in our view, Earl\u00a0Jowitt\u2019s statement of the law on the degree of proof required is unfortunate to the extent that he included the expression \u201cnot merely illusory\u201d in his statement. Those words were not helpful in the context of <i>Juan Ysmael</i>, where the dispute concerned the ownership of a ship. The Privy Council held that the claim of the Republic of Indonesia as the owner of the ship was manifestly defective because the party which had purported to sell the ship to it had no authority to do so; nor was the ship in its (<i>ie</i>, the Republic of Indonesia\u2019s) possession through a master appointed by the Republic of Indonesia.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Earl\u00a0Jowitt\u2019s test has not escaped criticism. In <i>Rahimtoola</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>), Lord\u00a0Denning said that the test left many questions unanswered, such as the degree of proof that was needed to assert state immunity. In our view, the test is so vague outside the context of claims to title to tangible property that Earl\u00a0Jowitt could not have intended it to apply to intangible property, such as debts or trust funds or moneys held in escrow. Its inadequacy in the present case is quite evident. Here, the Funds were held in escrow subject to the fulfilment of a specific condition (<i>ie</i>, the Escrow Condition). The Appellant claims ownership of the Funds on the ground that the Escrow Condition had been fulfilled in its favour, but this claim is contested by the Respondents. Moreover, the High Court has already allowed the adverse claims of PNB (the original account holder and the escrow agent) and the Respondents to be interpleaded. The Appellant did not intervene at that time to assert immunity on the ground that it was indirectly impleaded by the claims of the Respondents, which it could have done. The application of the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test to stay the interpleader proceedings without the court determining whether the Escrow Condition has been fulfilled would merely put the cart before the horse. It would simply leave the claim of the Appellant to the Funds undetermined and indeterminable so long as the Appellant refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts to prove its claim conclusively. This would, in turn, leave the disposal of the Funds hanging in the air. These undesirable consequences must create a doubt as to whether, as a matter of legal policy, the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test should be applied to a case like the present.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, having regard to the circumstances in this case, the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test should not be applied in the present case for the policy considerations we have outlined in the preceding paragraph. The Judge could and should have decided the threshold issue of whether the Forfeiture Order fulfilled the Escrow Condition as that question must be answered in the affirmative before the Appellant has a basis to stay the interpleader proceedings to begin with. This is a threshold issue and not an issue to be left to the interpleader proceedings proper. In our view, the Judge was in error in deciding that this was a substantive issue to be decided only in the substantive proceedings should the parties proceed further with the Interpleader Summons. The real consequence of the Judge\u2019s holding that the Appellant was entitled to assert state immunity without the question of whether the Forfeiture Order fulfilled the Escrow Condition being determined is that the issue would never be decided had the court not found that the Appellant had submitted to its jurisdiction as, in the absence of such a finding, the interpleader proceedings would simply have been stayed. The Respondents would have been completely shut out from proceeding with their claims to the Funds without really knowing whether, under Singapore law, the Forfeiture Order was binding on or enforceable against them, or had any legal effect on the status of PNB as the escrow agent \u2013 in other words, without knowing whether the Escrow Condition had been satisfied.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The critical issue in the Stay Application is whether the Appellant has a sufficient interest in the Funds to assert state immunity so as to stop the Respondents from interfering with its title to or its possession or control of the Funds. The Appellant certainly has an arguable claim by virtue of the Forfeiture Order. But, since the legal effect of the Forfeiture Order on the status of the escrow is challenged by the Respondents under Singapore law, the Appellant\u2019s claim remains only an arguable one until the dispute is decided by the court. The Appellant has argued that whether or not the Forfeiture Order is binding on the Respondents or enforceable with respect to the Funds is irrelevant as it is not enforcing that order. But, that argument is premised on PNB being in possession and/or control of the Funds for the account of or on trust for the Appellant on the basis that the Escrow Condition has been satisfied</span><a id=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 5]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2013 which again brings us back to the threshold issue.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the circumstances of this case, we are of the view that the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test is not appropriate in the present case and that it should not be applied. Whether or not the Escrow Condition has been satisfied so as to enable the Appellant to claim that PNB is now holding the Funds for its account or on trust for it is a threshold issue, and not a substantive issue to be decided in the interpleader proceedings. Ironically, our conclusion that the question of whether the Forfeiture Order fulfilled the Escrow Condition is a threshold issue is supported by the Appellant\u2019s objective in including Prayer\u00a02 in the Stay Application. The Appellant has explained that if the court were to accept its arguments and stay the interpleader proceedings, the court must release the Funds to the Appellant as a matter of course as there would be nothing left to litigate. In other words, the Appellant is effectively asserting immunity on the ground that it is entitled to the beneficial interest in or ownership of the Funds, with such entitlement resting on the basis that the Forfeiture Order fulfilled the Escrow Condition and not merely on the basis that the Appellant\u2019s claim to the Funds was not illusory.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of our conclusions at [41]\u2013[43] above, the next question is whether we should remit the case to the Judge to decide the threshold issue of whether the Appellant is the beneficial owner of the Funds under Singapore law. In connection with this question, it is necessary to recall that the Judge also decided that, on the evidence, the Appellant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court through PNB as its agent as well as through its own action in including Prayer\u00a02 as part of the Stay Application (see [25] above). In our view, upon which we will elaborate later, the evidence does not show that PNB was or acted as an agent of the Appellant in the interpleader proceedings, whether by making a claim to the beneficial interest in the Funds or otherwise. As for Prayer\u00a02, it is not necessary for us to disagree with the Judge\u2019s finding that it constituted a step in the proceedings (and thus, a submission to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts) as we are of the view that the Stay Application as a whole was a step in the proceedings, albeit made under the label of a stay application. As such, regardless of how the above threshold issue is decided, a stay of the interpleader proceedings would not be appropriate on the facts of this case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we should add that our main ground for not remitting the threshold issue to the Judge for determination is that, in our view, the doctrine of state immunity should not be extended to a case like the present at all. There are two distinct features in this case that make it fall outside the established parameters of the doctrine. The first is that the property concerned, <i>ie</i>, the Funds, is in the nature of a debt or chose in action which is in the hands of a third party, <i>viz</i>, PNB as the escrow agent. The second is that the competing claims to the Funds have been interpleaded and the Funds are under the control of the court. Apropos these issues, the Respondents have argued that sovereign immunity is not applicable to property which is not in the possession and/or control of the sovereign state but in the hands of a third party against whom conflicting claims have been made, and that the Appellant does not have a recognisable interest in the Funds. Both issues overlap to the extent that they involve the same legal and policy considerations. In our view, there are merits in the Respondents\u2019 arguments on both issues, which we will now address.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does sovereign immunity apply to property in the hands of a third party?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We earlier stated (at [37] above) that the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not absolute. This is confirmed by the Privy Council in <i>Sultan of Johore</i> ([33] <i>supra</i>). We also referred (likewise at [37] above) to judicial statements that this doctrine should not be extended unnecessarily. With respect to the present case, no authority has been cited to us which shows that a sovereign state has previously been held to be entitled to assert immunity in proceedings involving property that is in the possession or control of a third party who is not an agent or a trustee of that state. The existing case law shows that in all the cases where the court ordered a stay of proceedings on an assertion of sovereign immunity, the sovereign state in question was in possession and/or control of the property which was the subject matter of the proceedings through an agent or a trustee. In <i>The Cristina</i> ([35] <i>supra</i>), Lord\u00a0Maugham said at 516\u2013517:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There is, I think, neither principle nor any authority binding this House to support the view that the mere claim by a Government or an ambassador or by one of his servants would be sufficient to bar the jurisdiction of the Court, except in such cases as ships of war or other notoriously public vessels or other public property belonging to the State. ...</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The result so far, in my opinion, is that whilst in this country no action can be brought against a foreign Government or its accredited representative or persons who may be described as belonging to his suite, <i>still, if the foreign Government</i> \u2026 <i>wishes to recover property in the hands of some third party, an action must be brought in the usual way and there must therefore be a submission to the jurisdiction up to the judgment.</i> \u2026 If the foreign Government wishes to recover property in this country, I am of opinion that it must, subject to certain exceptions, prove its case. If it is, rightly or wrongly, in possession of property in this country, no action can be brought against it by persons claiming title to or any interest in such property.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In a similar vein, in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Haile Selassie v Cable and Wireless, Limited</i> [1938] Ch\u00a0839 (\u201c<i>Haile Selassie</i>\u201d), Sir\u00a0Wilfred Greene\u00a0MR said at 844\u2013845:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The rule applies in the case both of actions in personam and of actions in rem. But it has never been extended to cover the case where the proceedings do not involve either bringing the foreign sovereign before the Court in his own person or in that of his agent or interfering with his proprietary or possessory rights in the event of judgment being obtained. Where it is either admitted or proved that property to which a claim is made either belongs to, or is in the possession of, a foreign sovereign, or his agent, the principle will apply. <i>But where property which is not proved or admitted to belong to, or to be in the possession of, a foreign sovereign or his agent is in the possession of a third party, and the plaintiff claims it from that third party, and the issue in the action is whether or not the property belongs to the plaintiff or to the foreign sovereign, the very question to be decided is one which requires to be answered in favour of the sovereign\u2019s title before it can be asserted that that title is being questioned. \u2026 It would be a strange result if a person claiming property in the hands of, or a debt alleged to be due by, a private individual in this country were to be deprived of his right to have his claim adjudicated upon by the Courts merely because a claim to the property, or the debt, had been put forward on behalf of a foreign sovereign.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Rahimtoola</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>), Viscount\u00a0Simonds, who delivered the leading judgment, referred to <i>Haile Selassie</i> and approved the correctness of the law as stated therein by the English Court of Appeal, but he neither approved nor disapproved of the way the court had applied the principle. He said, at 394\u2013396 of <i>Rahimtoola</i>:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Much stress has been laid on the fact that [the government of Pakistan] has not asserted a beneficial interest in the fund [in dispute]. But why should it? It is not concerned to admit, assert or deny. It has the legal title, which cannot be displaced except by litigation which it is entitled to decline. It rests on the principle, the statement of which I take from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i><a href=\"http://international.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?vc=0&amp;rp=%2ffind%2fdefault.wl&amp;DB=UK%2DCASELOC&amp;SerialNum=1938010528&amp;FindType=Y&amp;AP=&amp;fn=_top&amp;rs=WLIN8.02&amp;mt=WestlawUK&amp;vr=2.0&amp;sv=Split&amp;sp=SuCourtIA-0000\" target=\"_top\">Haile Selassie v. Cable and Wireless Ltd.</a></i> just because the [Nizam] particularly relied on that case: \u201cIf property locally situate in this country is shown to belong to, or to be in the possession of, an independent foreign sovereign, or his agent, the courts cannot listen to a claim which seeks to interfere with his title to that property, or to deprive him of possession of it.\u201d It is true that in that case [<i>ie</i>, <i>Haile Selassie</i>] the court did not decline to adjudicate on the claim of a foreign sovereign State: it did so on the ground that, as there stated, \u201cin the case of a debt such as that with which we are concerned there can be no question of possession or control and the title to it is the very thing which stands to be established or not to be established in these proceedings.\u201d Your Lordships are not concerned to consider whether the principle, which was there correctly stated, was also there correctly applied. In the present case its application does not appear to me to be in doubt. The property in dispute is situate in this country. I say that because it is, for many purposes, necessary to ascribe a situation to a chose in action which physically has none, and, for the purpose of this doctrine, no other situation can be ascribed to it than the place in which it can be sued for and enforced. A suit by a third party, the Nizam, is calculated and intended to interfere with the title of Rahimtoola and his principals, the Government of Pakistan, and with their possession or control of their property. It can only be maintained if the Government of Pakistan take a course which their sovereign dignity entitles them to reject and descend into the arena. I have used the words \u201cpossession or control\u201d because they are the words used in the statement of principle that I have adopted. It may be said that \u201cpossession\u201d is not an apt word in connexion with a chose in action, but it seems to me that the two words, whether used together or separately, are apt to describe the relation in which an owner stands to the property which he owns.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, Lord\u00a0Reid said (see <i>Rahimtoola</i> at 402) that the italicised passage from Sir\u00a0Greene\u00a0MR\u2019s judgment in <i>Haile Selassie</i>, which we had referred to earlier (at [46] above), must be read in the light of the decisions in <i>Dollfus Mieg</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>) and <i>Juan Ysmael</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>). Lord\u00a0Cohen merely said in <i>Rahimtoola</i> (at 409) that the case before him did not resemble <i>Haile Selassie</i>. But Lord\u00a0Somervell of Harrow, in a very short speech in the same case (see <i>Rahimtoola</i> at 410), expressed his disagreement with Lord\u00a0Maugham\u2019s statement in <i>The Cristina</i> (see [46] above), which was cited with approval by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Haile Selassie</i>, that in the type of cases Lord\u00a0Maugham had referred to, the sovereign state must prove its title. Lord\u00a0Somervell was of the view that all that the sovereign state had to do was to establish an \u201carguable\u201d (<i>Rahimtoola</i> at 410) case to assert immunity. It should be noted, however, that Lord\u00a0Somervell also expressed his agreement with Lord\u00a0Reid\u2019s view (as stated at 404 of <i>Rahimtoola</i>) that the suit against Rahimtoola should be stayed as Rahimtoola had the legal title to and possession of the money in question on behalf of Pakistan and that, in order to succeed, the Nizam would have to displace the legal title and the right of the state of Pakistan to recover that money. As this would directly implead Pakistan, the Nizam\u2019s claim should not be allowed to proceed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for Lord\u00a0Denning, he said in <i>Rahimtoola</i> at 415\u2013416:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It has sometimes been supposed that there is an absolute rule that a foreign Government cannot be impleaded in our courts in any circumstances, and, as a corollary, that it cannot be asked to come to our courts to litigate about its interest in property. That is supposed to be the result of Dicey\u2019s rule and Lord\u00a0Atkin\u2019s two set propositions. But there are difficulties in it. To begin with, the rule about \u201cnot impleading a foreign Government\u201d is by no means universal or absolute, as I will show. In the next place, the rule about \u201cproperty\u201d only applies, I think, to property which plainly or admittedly belongs to a foreign sovereign, or plainly or admittedly is in his possession or control. It is not appropriate in cases such as the present where the question \u201cTo whom does this debt belong?\u201d \u201cWhose property is it?\u201d is the very question which has to be decided in the action. It cannot also be the question which has to be decided on a summons to stay. It is obvious that, if that is the question to be decided by the courts, it ought to be decided at the trial \u2013 or, at any rate, at <i>a</i> trial \u2013 after full discovery and examination of witnesses, instead of being done imperfectly at this preliminary stage with no discovery and on insufficient materials. Lord Maugham was of that opinion. He thought the foreign Government ought to <i>prove</i> its title. But if that is to be done, there is no point in a stay. You might as well have the trial anyway. [emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Denning next proceeded to ask himself the question: What was the alternative? He referred to <i>Juan Ysmael</i>, where the Privy Council rejected Scrutton\u00a0LJ\u2019s statement in <i>The Jupiter</i> [1924] P\u00a0236 that a bare assertion by a sovereign state of its title to or interest in disputed property was sufficient to invoke state immunity as that proposition, if adopted, would carry the doctrine of state immunity to the extreme. At the same time, Lord\u00a0Denning expressed strong misgivings about the vagueness of the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test. He questioned why the evidence adduced by the state as proof of its claim to the disputed property could not be displaced by the adverse claimants in the same proceedings and, if the adverse claimants did so, whether the sovereign state would still be entitled to a stay. These comments are particularly appropriate and relevant to the present case, where the Respondents have argued that they had displaced the Appellant\u2019s \u201cnot merely illusory\u201d claim to the Funds by showing that the Forfeiture Order was not final and binding on them in a court in Singapore. After surveying the imprecise state of English law on sovereign immunity, Lord\u00a0Denning said at 417\u2013418 of <i>Rahimtoola</i>:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Such are the difficulties in the existing rules. I can see no satisfactory answer to them. They are so great that I think we should go back and look for the principles which lie behind the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Search as you will among the accepted sources of international law and you will search in vain for any set propositions. There is no agreed principle except this: that each State ought to have proper respect for the dignity and independence of other States. Beyond that principle there is no common ground. It is left to each State to apply the principle in its own way, and each has applied it differently. Some have adopted a rule of absolute immunity which, if carried to its logical extreme, is in danger of becoming an instrument of injustice. Others have adopted a rule of immunity for public acts but not for private acts, which has turned out to be a most elusive test. All admit exceptions. There is no uniform practice. There is no uniform rule. So there is no help there.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Search now among the decisions of the English courts and you will not find them consistent. They seem to have different rules about \u201cproperty\u201d according to the subject-matter. On the one hand, there are the cases about ships and other specific chattels. In these cases the courts have tended to apply the rule of absolute immunity. This rule was formed in the days when no action lay against the sovereign in any circumstances. It was thought to offend the dignity of a sovereign and to impinge on his independence if his subjects were allowed to sue him in his own courts. Likewise if he were sued in the courts of another country. Proper respect for sovereign power therefore required that a sovereign should not be impleaded, directly or indirectly, in the courts of his own or any other country without his consent. These cases have received a check lately by the case of <i>Sultan of Johore</i> v. <i>Abubakar Tunku Aris Bendahar</i>, where the Privy Council rejected the notion that there was any absolute rule about \u201cnot impleading a foreign Government.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On the other hand, there are the decisions about trust funds and other debts. These have a modern look about them. It is more in keeping with the dignity of a foreign sovereign to submit himself to the rule of law than to claim to be above it, and his independence is better ensured by accepting the decisions of courts of acknowledged impartiality than by arbitrarily rejecting their jurisdiction. In all civilised countries there has been a progressive tendency towards making the sovereign liable to be sued in his own courts; notably in England by the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947. Foreign sovereigns should not be in any different position. There is no reason why we should grant to the departments or agencies of foreign Governments an immunity which we do not grant our own, provided always that the matter in dispute arises within the jurisdiction of our courts and is properly cognizable by them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Beginning at 418 of <i>Rahimtoola</i>, Lord\u00a0Denning analysed the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Dollfus Mieg</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>) to allow Dollfus Mieg to sue BOE for conversion of the 13 gold bars, and held that it was consistent with Chancery decisions regarding trust funds and debts in which the sovereign state had to submit to the jurisdiction of the English courts in order to claim such property. He said, at 419\u2013421:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The action by the Dollfus Mieg company was allowed to continue against the bank for conversion of the 13 bars. Yet it is obvious that the Sovereign Governments could also bring an action against the bank for conversion of the same 13 bars, and in that action the bank could not dispute the bailor\u2019s title. No system of jurisprudence could view with equanimity the prospect of the bank being made liable twice over for one and the same conversion. The bank would have a clear right to interplead by inviting the Sovereign Governments to come in and either to maintain or relinquish their claim, or else be barred \u2026 The rule about \u201cnot impleading a foreign Government\u201d would not be applied so rigidly or so absolutely as to obstruct the justice of that course. ...</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 The court cannot allow the fund [<i>ie</i>, a trust fund in which a foreign government claims an interest] to lie stagnant for ever because one of the claimants is a foreign sovereign. In such a case, the court does not issue process to the foreign sovereign. It simply gives him notice of the proceedings ... If he, after being given an invitation, does not choose to come to our courts to make good his claim, the court will adjudicate as best as it can in his absence, and he will be bound by the decision. \u2026 Likewise with an English debt due in England to a creditor who comes to our courts to enforce it. If a foreign Government wishes to claim the debt, it ought, on being invited, to come to our courts to make good its claim. It cannot ask for the action to be stayed and do nothing more, because that would mean that the debt would remain unpaid for ever, which would be unjust to all others concerned. The creditor\u2019s action must therefore be allowed to continue, and in that action the claim of the foreign Government can be adjudicated upon in its absence \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Denning accepted that the application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity should not be determined by the finer points of domestic law where there were two lines of inconsistent decisions (in <i>Rahimtoola</i>, the inconsistency alluded to by Lord\u00a0Denning was that set out in the quotation at [50] above, <i>ie</i>, the inconsistency between English admiralty decisions, in which the doctrine of state immunity was applied strictly, and Chancery decisions, in which the doctrine was applied less rigidly), and found himself in a dilemma as to whether to disagree with the other law lords, who were in favour of staying the proceedings on the ground that Rahimtoola was holding the money in question for the government of Pakistan. He suggested that the answer lay in looking not at whether conflicting rights had to be decided, but at the nature of the conflict. On that basis, he held (at 423) that the transaction in <i>Rahimtoola</i> was in the nature of an inter-governmental transaction, and that that kind of dispute was best solved through inter-governmental negotiations in accordance with international law (citing <i>The Charkieh</i> (1873) LR 4\u00a0A\u00a0&amp;\u00a0E 59).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, the facts are quite different from those in <i>Dollfus Mieg</i> and <i>Rahimtoola</i>. Both of these cases are distinguishable in that, in both cases, the sovereign states concerned had either possession or an immediate right to possession (which is equivalent to possession in law) of the property in question, the title to which was disputed. Here, the competing claims to the Funds by PNB, as the original account holder and the escrow agent, and by the Respondents have already been interpleaded. The Funds are not in the possession of an agent or a trustee of the Appellant, but in the hands of a third party, <i>viz</i>, HE&amp;P, for the credit of the interpleader proceedings and under the control of the court. The essence of interpleader proceedings is that persons who have claims against property held by a third party must make their claims in the relevant proceedings. The court cannot release the disputed property to any claimant without the claimant submitting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction and proving its claim. In principle, there would be no reason why, in an appropriate case, a sovereign state may not intervene in interpleader proceedings to stay the proceedings. But, in the present case, if the Appellant claims that it has been indirectly impleaded as regards the Funds, it must be on the basis that the Funds have been vested in it by reason of the Forfeiture Order and that PNB is holding the Funds for its account or on trust for it. In fact, this is the very basis of the Appellant\u2019s case in these proceedings. As such, the Appellant should have instructed PNB to object or should itself have intervened to object to the Interpleader Summons and to ask for it to be dismissed. The failure of the Appellant to take those steps has not been explained, but it is, in our view, consistent with the position that either the Appellant or PNB did not then consider that the Funds had vested in the Appellant. The Appellant cannot now make such a claim without also accepting that it had, through PNB, submitted to the jurisdiction of the court in agreeing to be named as a defendant in the Interpleader Summons and in taking a large number of steps in the proceedings within the meaning of s\u00a04(3)(<i>b</i>) of the SIA, such as making interlocutory applications (including SIC\u00a04231/05) and filing affidavits.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the circumstances of this case, we are of the view that the doctrine of sovereign immunity should not be extended to a case involving debts or choses in action in the possession or control of a third party in respect of which the claimant state has yet to prove its ownership. We agree with Lord\u00a0Maugham\u2019s statement in <i>The Cristina</i> at 516\u2013517 (see [46] above) on this point, and distinguish Lord\u00a0Somervell\u2019s contrary view (see [48] above) on the ground that PNB originally had the legal title to the Funds (and still retains it through HE&amp;P) and is entitled to recover the Funds in the event that the Respondents fail to prove a better title to or interest in the Funds. In the circumstances, the Appellant cannot claim that it has been indirectly impleaded with respect to the Funds until and unless it proves that the Forfeiture Order has vested in it the title to the Funds under Singapore law; that, in turn, depends on whether the Forfeiture Order is binding on and enforceable against PNB and the Respondents under Singapore law. And, if the Appellant contends, as it has done (see [21] above), that it had possession and/or control of the Funds through PNB (<i>ie</i>, the Appellant alleges that PNB was holding the Funds for its benefit on the basis that the Escrow Condition had been satisfied), then the Appellant should have directed PNB to assert immunity, or the Appellant on its own should have asserted immunity in the Interpleader Summons and asked for it to be dismissed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would add that even on the test propounded by Lord\u00a0Denning, <i>ie</i>, whether the transaction here is of an inter-governmental nature (see [51] above), we would answer \u201cNo\u201d to the question of whether sovereign immunity could be asserted in the present case. The original transactions between the Swiss authorities and the Appellant were of an inter-governmental nature. However, the Swiss authorities did not release the Funds to the Appellant on the basis that the Appellant had title to the Funds. Instead, they released the Funds on the condition that the Funds should be held in escrow until a final and binding decision by the courts of the Philippines in the form of either a restitutionary or a forfeiture order. A restitutionary order in favour of the Appellant would imply that the Funds were previously owned by the Appellant, whereas a forfeiture order would simply signify that the Funds were the ill-gotten gains of the late Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, but not necessarily gains derived from the Appellant itself. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that as between the Appellant and the Respondents, the dispute as to the ownership of the Funds was of an inter-governmental nature.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances and for the reasons given above, we are satisfied that the Stay Application is ill-founded and should be dismissed. There is no reason to extend the doctrine of sovereign immunity to a case like the present where staying the proceedings would create more problems for every party, including the Appellant itself, than it solves.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does the Appellant have a recognisable interest in the Funds?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to the question of whether the Forfeiture Order confers on the Appellant a recognisable interest in the Funds insofar as that order is evidence that the Appellant\u2019s claim to the Funds is \u201cnot merely illusory\u201d. Should this be treated as a sufficient basis to stay the interpleader proceedings?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the answer to the above question is \u201cNo\u201d. In the present case, the Appellant was fully aware that its reliance on the Forfeiture Order\u2019s legal effect on the Funds under Singapore law as the basis of its claim to title to those moneys was contested by the Respondents. Until this disputed issue is settled, PNB would still hold the Funds as the escrow agent pending a ruling by our courts as to whether the Forfeiture Order satisfied the Escrow Condition. If the court were to stay the interpleader proceedings on the basis that the Appellant\u2019s claim founded on the Forfeiture Order is \u201cnot merely illusory\u201d, the Respondents would, as we pointed out earlier (at [40]\u2013[41]), be precluded from proceeding with their claims to the Funds without the Appellant having proved or having to prove its alleged ownership of those funds. In our view, there are overriding considerations of justice and policy to reject such an outcome.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first consideration is that a stay of the interpleader proceedings in such circumstances would give rise to injustice to the Respondents (see, in this regard, Lord\u00a0Denning\u2019s statement in <i>Rahimtoola</i> ([36] <i>supra</i>) at 419\u2013421, which is reproduced at [50] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second consideration is that if the Appellant decides not to proceed further to prove its claim, the Funds will remain in the possession of HE&amp;P and under the control of the court indefinitely. There will be no finality to the proceedings (which is contrary to public policy) until and unless the Appellant decides to submit to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts to prove its claim (see also [40] above). No one benefits from this stalemate, not even the Appellant as it will not be able to obtain the release of the Funds of which it claims, but declines to prove, ownership. This is not a result that any court will accept with equanimity, even taking into account the doctrine of state immunity. It is only just and in conformity with the public policy of Singapore that the Appellant should submit to the jurisdiction of our courts if it wishes to claim the Funds on the basis that it has a beneficial interest in them. As Lord\u00a0Denning stated in <i>Rahimtoola</i> at 420\u2013421 in the context of an English debt due in England to a creditor who sought to enforce that debt in the English courts:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If a foreign Government wishes to claim the debt, it ought, on being invited, to come to our courts to make good its claim. It cannot ask for the action to be stayed and do nothing more, because that would mean that the debt would remain unpaid for ever [<i>sic</i>], which would be unjust to all concerned. The creditor\u2019s action must therefore be allowed to continue, and in that action, the claim of the foreign Government can be adjudicated upon in its absence: see <i>Haile Selassie</i> \u2026 by [Sir]\u00a0Greene. If the English creditor succeeds and is paid, and the foreign Government should afterwards seek to make the debtor pay twice over, our courts would not permit it. Seeing that the foreign Government had refused to do the debtor the justice of coming in when given the chance, our courts would not permit it \u201cto commit that injustice against him.\u201d Those were Lord\u00a0Eldon\u2019s words in <i>Stevenson</i> v. <i>Anderson</i> [(1814) 2\u00a0V\u00a0&amp;\u00a0B 407], a case of interpleader, which Lord\u00a0Hatherley said [in <i>Larivi\u00e8re</i> v. <i>Morgan</i> (1871\u201372) LR\u00a07 Ch\u00a0App\u00a0550] had a great analogy. And if the foreign Government should seek to sue the debtor in any foreign court, I would assume, as Lord\u00a0Hatherley did, \u201cthat the courts of all countries would recognize the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction in a country where the property was situated, and where the rights were properly to be tried.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In our view, the Stay Application should also have been dismissed on this ground.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to our findings, it would technically not be necessary for us to consider issues\u00a0(b), (c) and (d) referred to at [26] above. However, as the Appellant has devoted its oral pleadings substantially to arguing that the Judge was wrong in his findings on these issues, we will address them in the interest of completeness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Did PNB submit to the court\u2019s jurisdiction as the agent of the Appellant?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Judgment, the Judge accepted that PNB was the original account holder and also the escrow agent with respect to the Funds. However, he also found as a fact that PNB was and/or had acted as the Appellant\u2019s agent in the interpleader proceedings. This meant that PNB, as the first defendant in the Interpleader Summons, was both the original account holder and the escrow agent, as well as the Appellant\u2019s agent in claiming the Funds. The Judge\u2019s reasons for concluding that PNB was the Appellant\u2019s agent and had acted as such were as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge was of the view that \u201cPNB\u2019s participation in the proceedings was at the behest of the [Appellant] pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by [the] PCGG\u201d (see the Judgment at [23]) under Resolution No\u00a02004-Y-001. This resolution authorised PNB to retain certain sums from the Funds \u201cto cover the litigation and administrative costs to be incurred in the <i>recovery and transfer</i> <i>to the Republic of the Philippines</i> of the account in the bank in Singapore\u201d [emphasis added by the Judge] (<i>ibid</i>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As such, contrary to the assertion at para\u00a031 of the written submissions filed by PNB on 14\u00a0October 2004 for the Interpleader Summons (\u201cWS\u00a031\u201d) that <i>PNB</i> was \u201cundoubtedly the legal-title holders [<i>sic</i>] to the [F]unds as well as <i>beneficially entitled to the same</i> as adjudicated by the Swiss courts and the Philippines Supreme Court and the Philippines Supreme Court En Banc\u201d [emphasis added], the Judge found that \u201c[w]hen PNB made a claim for the beneficial interest in the Funds, it <i>could only be doing that</i> on behalf of the [Appellant] pursuant to the resolution of the PCGG\u201d [emphasis added] (see the Judgment at [24]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It followed (at [27]\u2013[28] of the Judgment) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[W]hen PNB submitted to the jurisdiction of this court and claimed a beneficial interest in the Funds, it was doing that as an agent of the [Appellant] acting under the authority vested in it by the PCGG [R]esolution[s].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The [Appellant] has therefore, by its agent PNB, laid its claim before this court and has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear from these passages that the Judge construed the PCGG Resolutions as having the effect of appointing PNB as the Appellant\u2019s agent to recover the Funds and transfer them to the Appellant. The Appellant\u2019s contention is that the PCGG Resolutions were not intended to and did not appoint PNB as the Appellant\u2019s agent; nor did the Appellant (or the Escrow Agreement) authorise PNB to assert the Appellant\u2019s title to the Funds. The PCGG Resolutions were intended only to reimburse and remunerate PNB for expenses incurred and services rendered as escrow agent in recovering the Funds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the evidence before us, we agree with the submission of the Appellant. In our view, PNB was never appointed as an agent of the Appellant in connection with the Marcos assets for the following reasons:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The PCGG itself is an agent of the Appellant. As such, it had no authority to appoint an agent (<i>ie</i>, PNB) for the Appellant without express authority from the latter: <i>delegatus non potest delegare</i>. There is no evidence that the PCGG was conferred such authority.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The words of Resolution No\u00a02004-Y-001 are not apt as words of appointment. When read in the context of the Escrow Agreement and of PNB\u2019s role as the escrow agent, it is clear that the resolution was intended to fix the amount of reimbursement and remuneration that PNB would be entitled to deduct from the Funds if and when it succeeded in recovering the Funds from WBL in a Singapore court. Clause\u00a07 of the Escrow Agreement (see [7] above) stated that, <i>inter alia</i>, PNB was entitled to reimbursement from the Funds for expenses incurred in any litigation concerning the Funds. If the PCGG had intended to appoint PNB as the Appellant\u2019s agent via Resolution No\u00a02004-Y-001, it would have done so expressly, and would not have left it to be inferred from the words used in that resolution (read with cl\u00a07 of the Escrow Agreement), which addressed a different subject matter, <i>viz</i>, the reimbursement and remuneration of PNB as the escrow agent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was no reason for PNB to make a claim to the Funds on the Appellant\u2019s behalf when PNB itself was in a position to claim the Funds on its (PNB\u2019s) own behalf. As the original account holder and the legal owner of the Funds while they were held in accounts at WLB, PNB was in as good a position as the Appellant to recover the Funds from WLB. Any action taken by PNB to recover the Funds for itself would have been done <i>not on behalf of the Appellant</i> (which claimed a proprietary interest in the Funds by reason of the Forfeiture Order), but on its (PNB\u2019s) own behalf, albeit <i>for the benefit of the Appellant</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appointment of PNB as the Appellant\u2019s agent to recover the Funds in the interpleader proceedings would be tantamount to a submission by the Appellant to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. There was no reason why, if the Appellant was prepared to submit to jurisdiction in that manner, it did not simply submit to jurisdiction in its own name.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A final consideration that undermines the Judge\u2019s finding that PNB was the agent of the Appellant in the interpleader proceedings is that if that finding were correct, it would not have been necessary for the Judge to rely on WS\u00a031 as a basis for inferring that PNB was the agent of the Appellant (see the Judgment at [18], [19] and [24]). If this court were to agree with the Respondents that WS\u00a031 itself constituted a sufficient act of submission to jurisdiction, then it would be open to the Respondents to argue that PNB, in its capacity as the Appellant\u2019s agent, had taken a large number of steps in the proceedings for the purposes of s\u00a04(3)(<i>b</i>) of the SIA. These steps would include the filing of the written submissions of 14\u00a0October 2004 itself, the participation in all the interlocutory applications to which PNB was a party and <i>a fortiori</i>, crucially, the application in SIC\u00a04231/05 (see [15] above) to stay the interpleader proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>: see Nourse\u00a0LJ in <i>Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Company and Republic of Iraq</i> [1995] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 25 (\u201c<i>Kuwait Airways</i>\u201d) at 32. Yet, the Respondents have not considered these acts as steps in the proceedings by the Appellant for the purposes of s\u00a04(3)(<i>b</i>) of the SIA. Accordingly, it is not open to the Respondents to selectively argue that WS\u00a031 implied that PNB was acting as the agent of the Appellant when they had never taken the view that all the steps taken by PNB in the interpleader proceedings (which we have earlier described at [15]\u2013[17] above) were done as the agent of the Appellant. For the same reason, it is also not open to the HR Claimants to argue that PNB, being only an escrow agent, could not have participated in the proceedings independent of the Appellant\u2019s claim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, for these reasons, we would disagree with the Judge\u2019s finding that the Appellant had appointed PNB as its agent to assert its (the Appellant\u2019s) interest in the Funds on its behalf. It follows that PNB had no authority to submit to the jurisdiction of our courts on behalf of the Appellant and, consequently, that the Appellant did not submit to jurisdiction through PNB.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Did PNB claim a beneficial interest in the Funds on behalf of the Appellant?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the text of WS\u00a031 itself, we have considerable doubts about whether the Judge was right to hold (at [24] of the Judgment) that when PNB claimed a beneficial interest in the Funds, it could only have been doing so on behalf of the Appellant. The relevant words in WS\u00a031 are:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">They [PNB] are the account holders of the funds with the Plaintiffs [<i>ie</i>, WLB]. As such, they are entitled to require that the Plaintiffs release the monies to them. They are undoubtedly the legal-title holders [<i>sic</i>] to the funds as well as beneficially entitled to the same as adjudicated by the Swiss Courts and the Philippines Supreme Court and the Philippines Supreme Court En Banc.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The words of claim \u201centitled to require\u201d in the above passage are referable to PNB\u2019s claim that it had the legal title to the Funds as the original account holder. The rest of the passage does not, however, contain words of claim, but rather, words of description of the purported rights of the Philippines itself. In any event, we do not need to come to a conclusion on this point, which is inconsequential in view of our conclusion that PNB did not act as the Appellant\u2019s agent in the interpleader proceedings (see [63]\u2013[65] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, whatever the purport of WS\u00a031 might be, we do not think that the mere filing of the written submissions by PNB on 14\u00a0October 2004 constituted making a claim in the interpleader proceedings. The reason is that these written submissions were not filed pursuant to any procedural rule or court order, and were never formally presented as oral arguments before the court. The written submissions were filed by D&amp;N (PNB\u2019s former solicitors) in preparation for the hearing of the substantive issues in the Interpleader Summons. But, that hearing never got underway by reason of the filing of the Stay Application by the Appellant. Until these written submissions are pleaded orally or adopted formally as the arguments of PNB, they are not binding on PNB and may be abandoned, changed or withdrawn. In our view, the mere filing of written submissions voluntarily does not amount to making a claim. It would be straining the procedural rules to construe unread written submissions filed in such circumstances as effectively being equivalent in standing to pleadings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Was Prayer\u00a02 a step in the proceedings for the purposes of the SIA?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before we deal with the facts pertinent to this issue, we should set out the law on what amounts to a step in the proceedings for the purposes of the SIA. Section\u00a04(3)(<i>b</i>) of the SIA provides that a state is <i>deemed</i> to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts if (subject to ss\u00a04(4) and 4(5), which are not relevant here) it has intervened or taken any step in the proceedings. The question of what is a \u201cstep in the proceedings\u201d has been considered by the Singapore courts in the context of arbitration. The Judge referred to and applied the test laid down in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Chong Long Hak Kee Construction Trading Co v IEC Global Pte Ltd</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\"><nobr>[2003] 4 SLR 499</nobr>, where</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Tay Yong Kwang\u00a0J</span> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">held at [14] that a step in the proceedings must reflect an \u201cunequivocal, clear and consistent\u201d intention to submit to the jurisdiction of the court. Tay\u00a0J\u2019s decision is in line with English decisions on the same expression in similar English statutes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same issue (<i>viz</i>, what constitutes a step in the proceedings) in the context of state immunity was judicially considered in the context of the State Immunity Act 1978 (c\u00a033) (UK) in <i>Kuwait Airways</i> ([64] <i>supra</i>). That case arose out of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990, in the midst of which the Iraqi Airways Company (\u201cIAC\u201d) flew ten civilian aircraft owned by the Kuwait Airways Corporation (\u201cKAC\u201d) to Iraq on the instructions of an Iraqi minister. KAC subsequently issued a writ against IAC and the Republic of Iraq, claiming, <i>inter alia</i>, the delivery of the surviving aircraft and consequential damages. In its defence, IAC argued that it was immune from the jurisdiction of the English courts because its acts were done in the exercise of sovereign power. KAC in turn contended that if IAC were immune, the latter had lost its immunity by submitting to the jurisdiction of the English courts when it filed a summons seeking a declaration, on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens</i> (see [70] below), that the court had no jurisdiction over it. In rejecting KAC\u2019s contention, the court in <i>Kuwait Airways</i> stated the following principles (at 31\u201332):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A defendant who does no more than claim immunity takes no step in the proceedings (<i>eg</i>, where a defendant serves a defence in which the only claim made is that of state immunity, even though the service of a defence would usually constitute a step in the proceedings).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A step in the action must be unequivocal and must be done with the knowledge of the material consequences (adopting Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR\u2019s formulation of a \u201cstep in the proceedings\u201d in <i>Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd v Yuval Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1978] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 357 at 361, an arbitration case).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court in <i>Kuwait Airways</i> then went on to analyse the implications of IAC\u2019s assertion of immunity and its reliance on <i>forum non conveniens</i> as part of its argument, and said as follows (at 32):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">No doubt a defendant who seeks a stay on the ground of forum non conveniens will usually take a step in the proceedings. But it is not correct to say that IAC has sought a stay on that ground here. If regard is had to the summons of Aug.\u00a02, 1991 and the affidavits in support, it is seen that the only material relief claimed is a declaration that the Court has no jurisdiction over IAC in respect of KAC\u2019s claim and that the claim is not justiciable in the Courts of England and Wales. The only reference to forum non conveniens is in the statement of the grounds of the application. Nowhere is the action sought to be stayed. <i>Reading the summons and the affidavits as a whole, I think it clear that \u201cforum non conveniens\u201d is advanced only as a ground for holding that there is no jurisdiction. No doubt what is actually being said, correctly as I think, is that a municipal Court has no jurisdiction to determine what is in reality a dispute of international law. In any event, it cannot possibly be maintained that IAC, by making such a case, is affirming the correctness of the proceedings or its willingness to go along with their determination by the English Courts. It is doing exactly the opposite.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The court accordingly concluded that IAC had not taken a step in the proceedings and therefore had not, nor was it deemed to have, submitted to the jurisdiction of the English courts. It should be noted that in <i>Kuwait Airways</i>, IAC did not apply to stay the proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens.</i> If IAC had done so, the court would have held that the former had taken a step in the proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Appellant argued before both the Judge and this court that Prayer\u00a02 was not, and was not intended to be, a step in the proceedings; rather, it was a prayer for relief which would naturally follow if the court were to stay the interpleader proceedings. In other words, it was purely a consequential and necessary order to a stay order.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Paragraph\u00a011 of the skeletal arguments which the Appellant filed on 26\u00a0July 2007 for this appeal states as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It [<i>ie</i>, Prayer\u00a02] is a necessary consequence that in the event that the Court finds in favour of the Appellant and grants a stay on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s immunity over the Funds, the Court must order the release of the Funds, which is held at its disposal. If the Court does not allow prayer\u00a02 or 4 of the Stay Summons for the release of the Funds, the Funds will remain indefinitely with [HE&amp;P]. There is a clear need for the relief sought in prayer\u00a02 or 4.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The premise in this argument is that if the court stays the proceedings, it would be on the basis that the Appellant has proved its title to the Funds, and hence, the release of these funds to the Appellant would be a natural consequence of such a finding. In such a situation, there would be nothing left for the court to do but to release the Funds to the Appellant and bring finality to the proceedings; otherwise, as the Appellant has argued in the passage quoted above, the Funds would remain with HE&amp;P indefinitely.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge rejected these arguments and held (at [33] of the Judgment) that Prayer\u00a02 amounted to a submission to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts because a request to the court to release the Funds to the Appellant would require the court to:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 consider the claims put forth by the [Appellant] and the other claimants, and be satisfied that the Funds should be released to the [Appellant] rather than to the other defendants. The court cannot do that without assuming jurisdiction over the dispute and the parties. The [Appellant], by asking the court to make that order, must necessarily be submitting to the jurisdiction of the court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At [46] of the Judgment, the Judge also said, with reference to the argument that Prayer\u00a02 was a consequential prayer ancillary to the determination of the Appellant\u2019s immunity:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">By endowing the prayer with the nature of a consequential, ancillary and necessary prayer, it is clear that the [Appellant] has intended that the prayer for the release of the Funds was to be proceeded with even if the claims of the ... Respondents were stayed. This was not a fallback step taken in the contingency that the proceedings are not stayed. Even assuming that it is correct for the [Appellant] to take the position that because the Funds are being held at the disposal of the court, the court must order their release, it does not mean that the court should order their release to the [Appellant]. If the [Appellant] does not submit to the jurisdiction, it should not want the court to make any order affecting it, save in connection to its assertion of state immunity, and it should not apply for an order that the Funds be released to it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the result, the Judge found that Prayer\u00a02 was a step in the proceedings under s\u00a04(3)(<i>b</i>) of the SIA, and that it remained so even after it had been withdrawn by the Appellant (see [23] above) for the reason that the step had already been taken.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present appeal, the Appellant contended that the Judge was wrong in holding Prayer\u00a02 to be a step in the proceedings when its purpose in the Stay Application was to assert immunity. In its rebuttal submissions filed on 16\u00a0October 2006 for the Stay Application, the Appellant, after citing <i>Kuwait Airways</i> ([64] <i>supra</i>) and <i>Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] SLR 168</nobr>, submitted</span><a id=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 6]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">that Prayer\u00a02:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">... does not evidence a willingness by the [Appellant] to submit to the first kind of jurisdiction. \u2026 It is apparent that the application is made solely in the context of [the] application pertaining to State Immunity, and not to a determination of the merits[.]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reference in the above quotation to \u201cthe first kind of jurisdiction\u201d is a reference to the speech of Lord\u00a0Fraser of Tullybelton in <i>Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s Bank Plc v Astro Dinamico Compania Naviera SA</i> [1984] 1\u00a0WLR 438, where his Lordship drew a distinction between two types of jurisdiction in stay applications, namely: (a)\u00a0the jurisdiction to decide a case on its merits (\u201cthe first kind of jurisdiction\u201d); and (b)\u00a0the jurisdiction to decide whether the court has the first kind of jurisdiction (\u201cthe second kind of jurisdiction\u201d). At 442\u2013443, Lord\u00a0Fraser said:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It was further contended on behalf of the appellants that the respondents either had waived any objection to the jurisdiction because they had taken a step in the action by applying for a stay, or that they would waive any objection if they persisted with their application in priority to disputing the jurisdiction. My Lords, it would surely be quite unrealistic to say that the respondents had waived their objection to the jurisdiction by applying for a stay as an alternative in the very summons in which they applied for an order giving effect to their objection to the jurisdiction. That summons makes it abundantly clear that they are objecting, and the fact that they ask for a decision upon their objection to be postponed until the outcome of the Greek proceedings is known is not in any way inconsistent with maintaining their objection. I can see no reason in principle or common sense why the respondents should not be entitled to say: \u201cWe object to the jurisdiction of the English courts, but we ask for the proceedings necessary to decide that and the other issues to be stayed pending the decision of the proceedings in Greece.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 By entertaining the application for a stay in this case, the court would be assuming (rightly) that it has jurisdiction to decide whether or not it has jurisdiction to deal with the merits, but would not be making any assumption about its jurisdiction to deal with the merits.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On the basis of this passage, counsel for the Appellant contended that the Stay Application was an application involving the second kind of jurisdiction only, and not the first kind of jurisdiction, and that the meaning of Prayer\u00a02 should therefore be considered in that light.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we noted at [73] above, the Judge declined to consider the meaning of Prayer\u00a02 in that light and rejected these arguments. In the light of the Judge\u2019s reliance on the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test to hold that the Appellant\u2019s claim to the Funds, not being illusory, was sufficient to stay the interpleader proceedings (see [25] above), it is understandable why the Judge had to construe Prayer\u00a02 as invoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction to release the Funds to the Appellant. The Judge\u2019s logic in dismissing the Stay Application despite finding that the Appellant\u2019s claim to the Funds was not merely illusory required that some meaning or purpose be given to Prayer\u00a02, and that could only be to require the court to adjudicate on the merits of the Appellant\u2019s claim and thereafter release the Funds to the Appellant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Appellant\u2019s contention before us was essentially that the Judge had misunderstood its argument on the purpose of Prayer\u00a02. The Stay Application, so it was argued, was premised on the court finding that the Funds belonged to the Appellant by virtue of the Forfeiture Order, and not on the finding that the Appellant\u2019s claim to the Funds was not illusory. The Appellant, so counsel submitted, intended Prayer\u00a02 to have a facilitative role, and not a destructive role.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the Appellant\u2019s approach or argument is founded on a fallacy and a misunderstanding of the nature of a stay application. Prayer\u00a02 is not and cannot be a consequence of an order of court to stay the proceedings. It is the very antithesis of such an order. As the Judge observed, a stay is a stay, and its only consequence is the suspension of all pending claims in the proceedings in question. What is abundantly clear, as the Appellant has admitted, is that the Appellant wanted the Funds to be released to it under Prayer\u00a02 (or, after the withdrawal of Prayer\u00a02, under prayer\u00a04 of the Stay Application).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Appellant might have avoided the fatal effect which Prayer\u00a02 had on the Stay Application if it had intended the prayer to operate only if the court found that it was the owner of the Funds, but not otherwise. Prayer\u00a02 would then simply not have become operational in the event of the court ruling against the Appellant on the issue of ownership. The conditionality of Prayer\u00a02 in such a scenario would have provided a credible explanation to what now appears to be inexplicable irrationality and self-destructiveness on the part of the Appellant in framing the Stay Application to include Prayer\u00a02. The Judge might even have accepted the argument just posited (<i>ie</i>, that Prayer\u00a02 was to operate only upon a ruling in favour of the Appellant <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the issue of ownership of the Funds) and construed Prayer\u00a02 in that light. However, since the Appellant denied that Prayer\u00a02 was meant to have this conditional effect, the Judge was left with the construction that Prayer\u00a02 meant what it said. In our view, Prayer\u00a02 was always intended to invoke the jurisdiction of our courts to release the Funds to the Appellant <i>irrespective of why (ie, the grounds on which) the interpleader proceedings were to be stayed, so long as those proceedings were stayed.</i> On the Appellant\u2019s own explanation, even if the Judge had decided to stay the interpleader proceedings on the basis that the Appellant had proved its title to the Funds, it would still have invoked Prayer\u00a02 to request the court to release the Funds to it<i>.</i> Accordingly, we find as a fact that the Appellant had always intended to take a step in the proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The effect of treating Prayer\u00a02 as independent of prayer\u00a01 of the Stay Application may be considered from another perspective. When the Appellant filed the Stay Application, it was aware that the Funds were under the control of the court for the credit of the proceedings (<i>ie</i>, they would only be released to the claimant(s) found by the court to be entitled thereto). The problem which the Appellant had to overcome in order to achieve its ultimate objective of securing the release of the Funds was to find a way to procure such release without submitting to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. The Appellant considered that the solution lay in asserting state immunity in a stay application. In other words, the Stay Application was merely a pretext to persuade the court to release the Funds. From this perspective, and given the Appellant\u2019s ultimate objective, the Appellant had always intended the court to consider the merits of its claim to the Funds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Summary of our findings</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, we find as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A sovereign state is not entitled to invoke the doctrine of state immunity in a case involving claims to debts or choses in action that are in the hands of a third party which is not an agent or a trustee of the state, and especially where, as in the present case, the disputed assets are held in escrow by the third party for the credit of the proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the facts of this appeal, the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test is not sufficient as a test for determining whether or not the Appellant is entitled to assert immunity to the interpleader proceedings. This is because although the Appellant\u2019s claim to the Funds based on the Forfeiture Order is \u201cnot merely illusory\u201d, the legal effect of that order under Singapore law is disputed by the Respondents. If a stay were to be granted merely on the basis that the Appellant has satisfied the <i>Juan Ysmael</i> test, it would have the effect of leaving the threshold issue of whether the Forfeiture Order fulfilled the Escrow Condition undecided, and the Funds would remain in the control of the court indefinitely. This would be unjust to third party claimants (such as the Respondents) and is contrary to the public policy that there should be finality in court proceedings. (The Judge could have decided the above threshold issue, but he declined to do so and the Appellant has not appealed on this ground.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PNB did not act as the Appellant\u2019s agent in the interpleader proceedings, and therefore the Appellant could not have submitted to the jurisdiction of the court via PNB.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prayer\u00a02, in seeking the release of the Funds to the Appellant, was a step in the proceedings for the purposes of s\u00a04(3)(<i>b</i>) of the SIA, and therefore amounted to a submission to the jurisdiction of the court. In any event, the Stay Application, construed as a whole, had the effect of a submission to the jurisdiction of the court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above findings, we dismiss the appeal. As the Appellant has succeeded on issues\u00a0(b) and (c) as set out at [26] above but failed on issues\u00a0(a) and (d), we order that it bear 50% of the costs of the Respondents in the appeal, with the usual consequential orders.</span></p>\n\n<div><br clear=\"all\"/>\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">See section\u00a01 of the Executive Order dated 28\u00a0February 1986.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 2]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">See para\u00a02 of the court order dated 24\u00a0March 2004.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn3\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 3]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">See para\u00a05 of the affidavit of the Philippines Ambassador to Singapore dated 8\u00a0March 2006.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn4\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 4]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">See para\u00a043 of the Appellant\u2019s skeletal arguments dated 26\u00a0July 2007.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn5\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 5]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">See paras\u00a043\u201344 of the Appellant\u2019s skeletal arguments dated 26\u00a0July 2007.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn6\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn6\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 6]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">At para 19 of the Appellant\u2019s rebuttal submissions.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The judge in the court below (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) answered this question in the negative (see <i>Re Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2008] 1 SLR 569</nobr> (\u201cthe GD\u201d) at [2]). She then dismissed the application of the appellant, Oriental Insurance Co Ltd (\u201cOriental\u201d), for a three-week extension of time to file its proof of debt pursuant to the scheme of compromise and arrangement entered into between the respondent, Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd (\u201cReliance\u201d), and its creditors including Oriental (\u201cthe Scheme\u201d).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge\u2019s decision effectively meant that Oriental was prevented from recovering any portion of its outstanding claim of approximately US$20m from Reliance. Oriental appealed against the Judge\u2019s decision. We allowed Oriental\u2019s appeal and now give the detailed reasons for our decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>The facts</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Events leading up to the Scheme</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reliance was incorporated locally in July 1996 and was in the business of undertaking general insurance. At its inception, Reliance was a fully-owned subsidiary of Reliance Insurance Company (\u201cRIC\u201d), a company incorporated in the US. RIC ran into financial difficulties in 2000, and its financial frailty affected Reliance\u2019s operations, rendering it no longer feasible for Reliance to continue business. As a consequence, Reliance\u2019s management decided that the best commercial option would be to enter into a voluntary run-off of the company. This was initiated in April 2001 (see the GD at [3]).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, Whittington Investment Guernsey Ltd (\u201cWIG\u201d) acquired the entire share capital of Reliance sometime in 2004. As the run-off proved to be both costly and time-consuming, Reliance, under its new ownership, decided that the most efficient and effective method of settlement with its creditors would be the implementation of a solvent scheme of arrangement (in the form of the Scheme) under s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act. Whittington Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, a company alleged by Oriental (and which appears) to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of WIG, was duty appointed as the scheme manager having conduct of the Scheme (\u201cthe Scheme Manager\u201d). It appears from para\u00a01.7 of the explanatory statement to the Scheme (\u201cthe Explanatory Statement\u201d), which is reproduced at [7] below, that the acquisition of Reliance by WIG in 2004 was motivated by business considerations, namely, an expedient conclusion of the run-off by means of the Scheme. According to Reliance, the Scheme would have the advantage of concluding the run-off of Reliance\u2019s business much earlier than would be the case if the run-off were to continue until all claims from Reliance\u2019s creditors (referred to as \u201cScheme Creditors\u201d in these grounds of decision) had materialised and had been agreed to and paid in the normal course of business (see the GD at [4]).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To implement the Scheme, Reliance sent a letter dated 18\u00a0November 2005 to all the Scheme Creditors, including Oriental (an insurance company incorporated in India and wholly-owned by the Indian government), informing them about and seeking their support of the Scheme. The letter was sent to Oriental\u2019s general address at A-25/27, Asaf Ali Road, New Delhi 110002, India (\u201cthe General Address\u201d).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to s\u00a0210(1) of the Companies Act, Reliance applied on 19\u00a0May 2006 to the High Court for permission to convene a creditors\u2019 meeting. By an order of court dated 2\u00a0June 2006, a meeting of the Scheme Creditors (\u201cthe Court Meeting\u201d) was ordered to be convened to consider whether the Scheme should be approved. On 16\u00a0June 2006, Reliance sent the notice of the Court Meeting (which was to be held on 26\u00a0September 2006), the Explanatory Statement and the documents setting out the terms and conditions of the Scheme (\u201cthe</span> Scheme of Compromise and Arrangement\u201d) <span lang=\"EN-AU\">to Oriental at the General Address. The proxy form, voting form and a specimen proof of debt form were also bound together with the above documents (collectively, all the documents sent to the Scheme Creditors, including Oriental, will be referred to as \u201cthe Scheme Documents\u201d). It was not disputed that Oriental received the Scheme Documents (see the GD at [7]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Key provisions of the Scheme Documents</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of this appeal, we think it would be helpful to set out some of the salient provisions of the Scheme Documents, particularly those relating to the purpose of the Scheme, the filing of proofs of debt by Scheme Creditors and the payment of Scheme Creditors\u2019 claims (\u201cScheme Claims\u201d).</span> Paragraph\u00a01.7 of the Explanatory Statement explained that the objectives of the Scheme <span lang=\"EN-AU\">were to <i>conclude the run-off of Reliance\u2019s business earlier</i> than would be the case if the run-off were to continue until all Scheme Claims had materialised and had been agreed to and paid, as well as to make <i>full payment</i> to all the Scheme Creditors:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>1.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 REASONS FOR SCHEME AND FOR SCHEME CREDITORS TO APPROVE THE SCHEME</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">\u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The Company [<i>ie</i>, Reliance] does not expect the run-off of the Company\u2019s business to be completed for many years and as a result believes that a Scheme of Arrangement should be the most efficient and effective method of making <i>full payments</i> to Scheme Creditors in the shortest practicable time. <i>A Scheme will have the effect of concluding the run-off of the Company\u2019s business earlier than would be the case if it were to continue until all claims had materialised and had been agreed and paid in the normal course</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The aim of the acquisition of the Company by WIG was for WIG to conclude the run-off by use of a <i>solvent scheme of arrangement, which is intended to cover all creditors of the Company</i>.

The Judge held that the sole issue before her was whether the court had jurisdiction to extend the time for a creditor to file its proof of debt after the court had approved a scheme of arrangement (see the GD at [2]), and she was of the view that, although this issue was a relatively narrowly-defined one, it had to be analysed \u201cwithin the entire framework of <span lang=\"EN-AU\">principles and procedures that govern[ed] compromises and schemes of arrangements\u201d (<i>id</i> at [22]). The Judge observed that the answer to the question turned on the nature of schemes of arrangement, and that there was \u201csome controversy as to whether a scheme of arrangement derived its efficacy from an order of court, or from the statute\u201d (<i>id</i> at [27]), given that the two jurisdictions from which s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act was derived (namely, the UK and Australia) had adopted radically different solutions to the same conundrum (<i>id</i> at [28]\u2013[31]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The English approach (which will be considered in greater detail at [48]\u2013[52] below), as embodied in the Privy Council decision of <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Kempe v Ambassador Insurance Co</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">[1998] 1\u00a0WLR 271 (\u201c<i>Kempe</i>\u201d), takes the position that a scheme of arrangement which has been approved by the requisite majority of the company\u2019s creditors derives its efficacy purely from statute and therefore operates as a statutory contract. Thus, save in cases of obvious mistakes in the documents setting out the scheme or fraud (where the court has inherent jurisdiction to make amendments to the scheme), once a scheme of arrangement has been approved by the necessary majority and sanctioned by the court, the court has no jurisdiction to make any substantive alterations to the scheme, including extending the time for creditors to file their proofs of debt pursuant to the scheme. In contrast, the Australian approach (considered at [53]\u2013[56] below) takes the position that a scheme of arrangement derives its efficacy from the order of court approving the scheme and in fact operates as an order of court. A court has inherent jurisdiction to vary its own orders. In any case, in our local context, O\u00a03 r\u00a04(1) of the Rules of Court (reproduced at [19] above), which provides that the court may by order \u201c</span>extend \u2026 the period within which a person is required or authorised by \u2026 any \u2026 <i>order</i> \u2026 to do <i>any act</i> in <i>any proceedings</i>\u201d [emphasis added]<span lang=\"EN-AU\">, would permit the court (after it has approved a scheme of arrangement) to grant a creditor an extension of time to file its proof of debt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After assessing both approaches, the Judge regarded the English approach as the more persuasive one and accordingly adopted it. She held (see the GD at [32]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b><i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">In my view, the English position is more persuasive than the Australian one and I therefore adopted it in this case. At the very core of every sanctioned scheme lies a statutory contract of compromise that fully-informed creditors have agreed to</span></i></b><span lang=\"EN-AU\">. The statutory provision exists primarily to overcome the impossibility of obtaining the individual consent of each and every member. Theoretically speaking, it is not impossible for such a scheme to be effective even <i>without</i> the court\u2019s sanction if the company and <i>all</i> its creditors agreed to the proposal, <i>ie</i>, there were no dissentients. The scheme then operates purely by way of contract. Of course, in reality, this is rarely achievable (especially in big companies), but <b><i>the point is that the sanction of the court adds no magic to the scheme, other than to bind dissentient members to a scheme which the court accepts as fair and reasonable</i></b>. \u2026 [W]here the statutory requirements have been satisfied, the discretion of the court in deciding whether to sanction the scheme is limited. <b><i>In this sense, one can view the source of efficacy of the scheme as the statutory provisions, and not, strictly speaking, the court order sanctioning the scheme</i></b>. This is, of course, not to detract from the fact that the court retains an <b><i>inherent jurisdiction</i></b> to correct any obvious errors in the scheme ...</span> [emphasis added in bold italics].</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge then considered the limited circumstances where a scheme of arrangement <i>which had already been approved by the court</i> (\u201ccourt-approved scheme\u201d) could be amended through the exercise of the court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction. She opined that an extension of a time limit set out in such a scheme was a \u201cmaterial alteration\u201d (see [38] of the GD, quoting from <i>Kempe</i> at 276) and, therefore, the court had no jurisdiction to make such an alteration. The Judge\u2019s reasoning was as follows (see the GD at [38] and [40]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once a scheme of arrangement has been sanctioned and registered, it may only be amended in <i>very limited circumstances</i>. This is effected through the exercise of the court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction. <b><i>Thus, a court-sanctioned scheme may be set aside where consent to it has been obtained by fraud (Fletcher v Royal Automobile Club Ltd <nobr>[2000] 1 BCLC 331</nobr>), or where there are any \u201cobvious mistakes\u201d in the document (Kempe at 276)</i></b>. The general principle, however, is that the court cannot alter the <i>substance</i> of the scheme and impose upon creditors arrangements to which they did not agree (<i>Kempe</i> at 276). <b><i>It has been held that an amendment to time limits set out in a scheme constitutes a \u201cmaterial alternation\u201d</i></b> (<i>Kempe</i> at \u2026 276) and an \u201camendment of substance\u201d (<i>In</i> <i>Re Forklift Sales (SA) Pty Ltd</i> (1972) 3\u00a0SASR 21 at 25 \u2026 ).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b><i>In my view, this proposition is in tandem with the principle that the court has no jurisdiction to alter the substance of the scheme and impose upon creditors an arrangement to which they had not agreed</i></b>. The s\u00a0210 procedure would need to be adhered to rigorously in any application for amendment to schemes of arrangement and the safeguards therein would ensure that terms to which the majority of the creditors do not agree will not be imposed on them \u2013 the original scheme is amended by the creditors, <i>not</i> by the court. Even then, the court is naturally reluctant to reopen [creditors\u2019] rights and obligations: <i>Re Elliott\u2019s</i> [<i>MF Services Pty Ltd</i> <nobr>[1965] VR 756</nobr>] (at 757). <b><i>This strengthens the view that a scheme of arrangement should be viewed as a statutory contract the terms of which have been agreed to by the parties rather than imposed on them by an order of court</i></b>. Where the amendments sought are material or substantial, the court has no jurisdiction to grant such amendments and thereby impose on creditors something which they had not considered or agreed to.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge concluded by noting (at [41] of the GD):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The basis on which Oriental sought an extension of time was O\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court ... As I accepted the English position enunciated in <i>Kempe</i>, and this was not a case of fraud or obvious mistake, I found that there was no jurisdiction to grant such an extension of time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In arriving at her decision, the Judge (as mentioned at [20] above) considered at some length certain established principles relating to schemes of arrangement (which will be discussed at [42]\u2013[46] below), and was of the opinion that these principles supported and were consistent with the position adopted in <i>Kempe</i> (see the GD at [36] and [40]). The Judge also took pains to stress that \u201c[t]he <span lang=\"EN-AU\">overarching principle here [<i>ie</i>, in the case of a court-approved scheme] is one of <i>clarity</i>, <i>certainty</i> and <i>finality</i>, without which a scheme of arrangement cannot be efficaciously implemented\u201d [emphasis added] (see the GD at [25]), and it appeared that this was one of the main reasons which persuaded her to adopt the English approach as laid down in <i>Kempe</i>. She stated (at [44] of the GD):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\u2026 I was of the view that there would be serious repercussions if this application [by Oriental for an extension of time to file its proof of debt] was allowed, not only for Reliance, but also for future schemes of arrangement. <i>The most weighty consequence is that the certainty, efficacy and finality of schemes such as the present would be severely compromised</i>. If, on the facts of the present case, an application to extend time had been granted, the threshold for future creditors to seek an extension of time would be very low. There will then be no certainty and finality in a scheme such as the present because every time a creditor obtain[s] an extension of time, all the claims will have to be re-adjudicated. Much delay, which would be prejudicial to the scheme, will also ensue. This will be further complicated if, for example, interim dividends have already been paid out under the scheme, such as in <i>Kempe</i>. In fact, counsel for Reliance informed the court at the hearing that, were this application to be allowed, the entire scheme might have to be abandoned. This was in the light of the very nature and object of the Scheme, <i>viz,</i> to adjudicate and settle all claims more expeditiously than would be the case if Reliance continued to be in run-off. <i>In complex commercial arrangements such as the present where parties are legally advised and are fully informed, I am of the view that \u2026 the court should lean towards certainty as this is the course that is fairest and of most benefit to scheme creditors taken as a whole</i>.

Such a sterile approach, it was submitted, could lead to manifest injustice. In contrast, Reliance, reiterating the reasons given by the Judge in the GD for adopting the approach in <i>Kempe</i>, submitted that there were \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d<a id=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 3]</span></span></a> for adopting that approach. Reliance also submitted that in <i>Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd v CEL Tractors Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] 4 SLR 35</nobr> (\u201c<i>Daewoo</i>\u201d), a case which we will deal with in greater detail at [58]\u2013[59] below, \u201c[t]he Singapore Court of Appeal ha[d] <i>affirmed</i> that a scheme of arrangement [was] a <i>statutory contract</i> entered into between the company and scheme creditors\u201d<a id=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 4]</span></span></a> [emphasis added].</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the hearing before us, counsel for Oriental, Mr\u00a0N\u00a0Sreenivasan (\u201cMr\u00a0Sreenivasan\u201d), sought leave (which we granted) to introduce a new legal argument which had not been raised either in the court below or in Oriental\u2019s written case for this appeal and which had been made for the first time only in Oriental\u2019s written skeletal submissions for this appeal. This argument<a id=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 5]</span></span></a> was premised on s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act. Oriental submitted that s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) gave the court the jurisdiction to grant an extension of time for, <i>inter alia</i>, creditors to file their proofs of debt under a scheme of arrangement, and thus afforded an alternative ground to the Rules of Court (if the Australian approach were adopted), <i>independent of the nature of schemes of arrangement</i>, for this court to allow Oriental\u2019s application for an extension of time. As this argument concerned purely a point of law, and as adequate notice had been given to Reliance\u2019s counsel, we gave leave to Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan to raise this new argument before this court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>The issues on appeal</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main issue for our determination was whether the court had jurisdiction, be it pursuant to O\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court (if the Australian approach were adopted) or s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act, to extend the time for a creditor to file its proof of debt in respect of a court-approved scheme. An affirmative answer to this main issue would raise the corollary issue of whether an extension of time should be granted to Oriental on the facts of the present case. We should perhaps point out at this juncture, for the sake of clarity, that in respect of the main issue, the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d is used in these grounds of decision in the sense of \u201cpower\u201d to denote jurisdictional power (see <i>Ng Swee Lang v Sassoon Samuel Bernard</i> <nobr>[2008] SGCA 7</nobr> (\u201c<i>Ng Swee Lang</i>\u201d) at [26]), and not in the strict sense of the authority of the court to hear and determine a dispute brought before it (which was the meaning adopted in <i>Muhd Munir v Noor Hidah</i> <nobr>[1990] SLR 999</nobr> (\u201c<i>Muhd Munir</i>\u201d) at 1007, [9]). In <i>Ng Swee Lang</i>, Chan Sek Keong\u00a0CJ illustrated the concept of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as jurisdictional power with the following example (at [26]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[W]hen the court says that it has no jurisdiction to issue a Mareva injunction in aid of a foreign arbitration, it does not mean that the court does not have the authority to hear applications for Mareva injunctions in respect of pending or ongoing foreign arbitration. What it means, instead, is that that kind of injunction is not a relief which the court has jurisdiction (in the sense of jurisdictional power) or power to grant in the context concerned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In the present appeal, it appears that the parties have, in their submissions before this court and in the court below, used the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d interchangeably with \u201cpower\u201d. There is no doubt a distinction between \u201cjurisdiction\u201d (in the strict sense) and \u201cpower\u201d (see <i>Muhd Munir</i> at 1007, [9] for an elucidation of the distinction between the two), but, for the purposes of this appeal, we wish to make it clear that the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d is employed in the sense of jurisdictional power, and we believe that this is what the parties meant as well by their use of this term in their submissions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Whether the court has jurisdiction to extend the time for filing proofs of debt in respect of a court-approved scheme</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to extend the time (either pursuant to O\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court or s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act) for a creditor to file its proof of debt after the court has approved of a scheme of arrangement under s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act appears to be before the local courts for the first time; thus, the Judge quite rightly considered, at some length, the established principles in relation to schemes of arrangement before coming to her decision (see [20] and [25] above). We note, further, that whether or not the court can extend time in this context pursuant to the Rules of Court (as opposed to s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act) depends on the nature of schemes of arrangement, <i>viz</i>, whether they operate as statutory contracts or as orders of court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We agreed with the Judge that the above issues had to be resolved in the context of the established principles relating to and the nature of schemes of arrangement. In addition, we were of the opinion that it was equally important to give due consideration to the legislative history and purpose of s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act. It would therefore be useful here for us to first examine the statutory context of s\u00a0210 before considering some of the established principles in relation to schemes of arrangement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Legislative history and purpose of section\u00a0210 of the Companies Act</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Legislative history</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a0210 of the Companies Act, which governs compromises and schemes of arrangements in Singapore, provides as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b>Power to compromise with creditors and members</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b>210.</b>\u2014(1)\u00a0Where a compromise or [an] arrangement is proposed between a company and its creditors or any class of them or between the company and its members or any class of them, the Court may, on the application in a summary way of the company or of any creditor or member of the company, or, in the case of a company being wound up, of the liquidator, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors or of the members of the company or class of members to be summoned in such manner as the Court directs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A meeting held pursuant to an order of the Court made under subsection\u00a0(1) may be adjourned from time to time if the resolution for adjournment is approved by a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting or the adjourned meeting agrees to any compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement shall, <i>if approved by order of the Court</i><i>, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors or on the members or class of members, as the case may be, and also on the company or, in the case of a company in the course of being wound up, on the liquidator and contributories of the company</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">\u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subject to subsection\u00a0(4A) [which is not relevant to the present appeal], <i>the Court may grant its approval to a compromise or [an] arrangement subject to such alterations or conditions as it thinks just</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">\u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An order under subsection\u00a0(3) shall have no effect until a copy of the order is lodged with the Registrar [of Companies], and upon being so lodged, the order shall take effect on and from the date of lodgment or such earlier date as the Court may determine and as may be specified in the order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">\u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this section\u00a0\u2014</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">\u201carrangement\u201d includes a reorganisation of the share capital of a company by the consolidation of shares of different classes or by the division of shares into shares of different classes or by both these methods;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">\u201ccompany\u201d means any corporation or society liable to be wound up under this Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a0210 of the Companies Act originally appeared as s\u00a0176 of the Companies Act 1967 (Act\u00a042 of 1967) (\u201cthe 1967 Act\u201d), which was Singapore\u2019s first piece of companies legislation.

However, like the Australian s\u00a0411 (and contrary to the UK s\u00a0425), s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act uses the words \u201c<i>approved</i> by <i>order</i> of the Court\u201d [emphasis added] (see s\u00a0210(3) of the Companies Act and</span> s\u00a0411(4)(b) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act<span lang=\"EN-AU\">) instead of \u201c<i>sanctioned</i> by the court\u201d [emphasis added] (see s\u00a0425(2) of the 1985 UK Companies Act). Section\u00a0210 of the Companies Act also has a subsection (<i>ie</i>, s\u00a0210(4)) like subsection\u00a0(6) of the Australian s\u00a0411, which allows a court to grant its approval to a compromise or scheme of arrangement \u201csubject to such alterations or conditions as it thinks just\u201d. Such a provision is conspicuously missing from the body of the UK s\u00a0425. As will be elucidated later (at [64] below), the similarities between the wording of s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act and that of the Australian s\u00a0411, coupled with the differences in wording between these two statutory provisions and the UK s\u00a0425, have indeed a rather profound impact on whether the English or the Australian approach should be adopted in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">3</span>7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having discussed the legislative history of s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act as well as the corresponding provisions in the UK and Australia, we turn now to consider the purpose underpinning the enactment of s\u00a0210.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><em>Purpose</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The explanatory statement in the Companies Bill 1966 as well as the relevant parliamentary debates do not shed much light on the purpose behind the enactment of s\u00a0176 of the 1967 Act (the predecessor of s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act). However, the purpose behind legislative provisions on schemes of arrangement has been extensively considered and clarified by the English and the Australian courts. In <i>Re Norfolk Island And Byron Bay Whaling Co Ltd</i> (1969) 90\u00a0WN\u00a0(Pt\u00a01) (NSW) 351, Street\u00a0J summarised the purpose behind the then equivalent of the Australian s\u00a0411 as follows (at 354):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>The section is intended to provide machinery (i)\u00a0for overcoming the impossibility or impracticability of obtaining the individual consent of every member of the class intended to be bound thereby [ie, by the scheme of arrangement], and (ii)\u00a0for preventing, in appropriate circumstances, a minority of class members frustrating a beneficial scheme</i>. As Younger\u00a0J. said in 1917 [in <i>In re Guardian Assurance Company</i> [1917] 1\u00a0Ch 431 at 441] of the corresponding English section [<i>viz</i>, s\u00a0120 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908 (c\u00a069) (UK)], in terms later quoted by Astbury\u00a0J. in <i>In re Anglo-Continental Supply Co. Ltd.</i> [[1922] 2\u00a0Ch 723]: \u201cIts purpose is strictly limited; it does not confer powers; its only effect at any time is to supply, by recourse to the procedure thereby prescribed, the absence of that individual agreement by every member of the class to be bound by the scheme which would otherwise be necessary to give it validity.\u201d [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Street\u00a0J\u2019s view has been endorsed by the learned authors of <i>Australian Corporation Law: Principles and Practice</i> (Butterworths, Looseleaf Ed, 1991) (\u201c<i>Australian Corporation Law</i>\u201d) at vol\u00a02, para\u00a05.1.0010 (May 2005 release), and has been cited with approval by this court in <i>Daewoo</i> ([26] <i>supra</i>) at [24]. The learned authors of <i>Palmer\u2019s Company Law</i> (Geoffrey Morse ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Looseleaf Ed, 1992) (\u201c<i>Palmer</i>\u201d) have also expressed a similar view (at vol\u00a02, para\u00a012.009 (April 2007 release)) in respect of the UK s\u00a0425, as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>The aid of the section may be invoked when it is not otherwise possible to make some arrangement or compromise which would be in the interests of [the] company and the other party or parties to the arrangement</i>. It can be used whether the company is a going concern or is in the course of winding up. \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The value of the section is even more clearly shown when creditors are concerned. Prima facie no creditor can be bound by the agreement of the company with the other creditors or by an agreement between the latter. <i>A compromise approved by a great majority of creditors may be rendered ineffective if a comparatively small creditor were to object and to stand out against it. It is one of the purposes of s.\u00a0425 to meet this situation</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A leading local commentary on companies law shares the same view as well (see <i>Walter Woon on Company Law</i> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 3rd\u00a0Ed, 2005) (\u201c<i>Walter Woon</i>\u201d) at para\u00a016.2):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Section\u00a0210 [of the Companies Act (Cap\u00a050, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed)] provides for schemes of arrangement to be binding on creditors and members alike after the requisite approval by the specified majority and upon confirmation by the court. <i>This section obviates the need for a messy and complicated series of negotiations with a view to obtaining the unanimous approval of the members or creditors to a novation or assignment or other variation of their rights</i>. A scheme of arrangement may be proposed where it is desired to adjust members\u2019 or creditors\u2019 rights <i>inter se</i>, or to reorganize the share capital of the company, or in the case of a group, \u2026 [with a view to] reconstruction or merger. In particular, recourse to s\u00a0210 is often made when it [is] desired to compromise creditors\u2019 claims against an insolvent company. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bearing in mind the purpose of statutory provisions on schemes of arrangements as outlined in the preceding paragraphs, we turn now to consider some of the established principles in relation to such schemes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Certain established principles relating to schemes of arrangement</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned earlier (at [20], [25] and [29] above), in adopting the English approach and arriving at the decision that a court had no jurisdiction to extend the time for a creditor to file its proof of debt after the court had approved a scheme of arrangement, the Judge took into consideration, <i>inter alia</i>, some of the established principles in relation to schemes of arrangement (see the GD at [22]\u2013[25], [33]\u2013[36] and [38]\u2013[40]). As such, it would be appropriate to set out here (in a summary fashion) an overview of these principles before going on to consider in greater depth the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant an extension of time for a creditor to file its proof of debt in respect of a court-approved scheme.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, it is clear that a scheme of arrangement will not bind a company, its members and its creditors until the court approves it (see s\u00a0210(3) of the Companies Act, s\u00a0425(2) of <span lang=\"EN-AU\">the 1985 UK Companies Act,</span> s\u00a0411(4)(b) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act and <i>Walter Woon</i> at para\u00a016.11). The sanction of the court is not a mere formality (see <i>Buckley on the Companies Acts</i> (Dame\u00a0Mary Arden, Dan Prentice &amp; Sir\u00a0Thomas Stockdale gen eds) (LexisNexis UK, 15th\u00a0Ed, 2007) (\u201c<i>Buckley</i>\u201d), vol\u00a02 at para\u00a0425.53; <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Kempe</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([21] <i>supra</i>) at 276; and <i>Re British Aviation Insurance Co Ltd</i> <nobr>[2006] 1 BCLC 665</nobr> at [69]).</span> Before the court sanctions a scheme, it will have to be satisfied of three matters (see <i>Palmer</i> ([39] <i>supra</i>), vol\u00a02 at paras\u00a012.026\u201312.030 (July 2006 release); <i>Buckley</i>, vol\u00a02 at para\u00a0425.53; <i>Butterworths\u2019 Annotated Statutes</i> ([33] <i>supra</i>) at p\u00a0591; <i>Walter Woon</i> at paras\u00a016.11\u201316.15; <i>Gore-Browne on Companies</i> (Alistair Alcock gen ed) (Jordans, 45th\u00a0Ed, 2005) (\u201c<i>Gore-Browne</i>\u201d), vol\u00a02 at para\u00a046.27 (December 2004 release); <i>Ford</i> ([34] <i>supra</i>), vol\u00a02 at para\u00a024.160 (June 2007 release); <i>Re Halley\u2019s Departmental Store Pte</i> Ltd <nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 70</nobr> at 73, [12]; <i>Daewoo</i> ([26] <i>supra</i>) at [36]; and <i>Wah Yuen Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v Singapore Cables Manufacturers Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2003] 3 SLR 629</nobr> at [10]), namely:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court must be satisfied that the statutory provisions have been complied with. For example, the court must be satisfied that the resolution is passed by the requisite statutory majority at a meeting of the company\u2019s creditors or members (as the case may be) duly convened and held in accordance with the court order convening the meeting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court must be satisfied that those who attended the meeting were fairly representative of the class of creditors or the class of members (where applicable), and that the statutory majority did not coerce the minority in order to promote interests adverse to those of the class whom the statutory majority purported to represent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court must be satisfied that the scheme is one which a man of business or an intelligent and honest man, being a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of his interest, would reasonably approve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In respect of the last of the requirements just mentioned, the learned authors of <i>Palmer</i> provide a concise summary (at vol\u00a02, para\u00a012.030 (July 2006 release)) of how the court assesses whether the proposed scheme is one which an intelligent and honest member of the class concerned would reasonably approve:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">In exercising its discretion whether or not to sanction a scheme, the court traditionally, as we have seen, has stressed that <i>its function does not extend to usurping the view of the members or creditors.</i> \u2026 That approach has never meant, however, that, provided that the resolutions are duly passed, and that there is no coercion of a minority by a majority the court is bound to confirm the scheme and has no discretion. <i>The court is not a mere rubber stamp.</i> \u2026 <i>It will look at the scheme to see that it is a reasonable one: if it concludes that there is \u201csuch an objection to [the scheme] as that any reasonable man might say that he could not approve it\u201d</i> [<i>per</i> Lindley\u00a0LJ in <i>In re Alabama, New Orleans, Texas, and Pacific Junction Ry. Co.</i> [1891] 1\u00a0Ch 213 at 239]<i>, then the court may refuse to confirm the scheme</i>. The issue is often whether the scheme strikes a balance between the various interests involved which could be reasonably approved by the meetings. \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>The court will, however, in cases where the minority object, be strongly influenced by a big majority vote, for, provided that the scheme is fair and equitable, the court will not itself judge upon the commercial merits [of the scheme], which is the function of the class itself. The court in such cases will be slo</i><i>w to differ from the conclusion of the majority</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">The discretion of the court as to whether or not it should sanction a scheme is important since, once the scheme has been sanctioned, it binds all parties, even the dissentients (see <i>Buckley</i>, vol\u00a02 at para\u00a0425.53). In addition, we would add that, in Singapore, the court has the discretion pursuant to s\u00a0210(4) of the Companies Act to grant its approval \u201csubject to such alterations or conditions as it thinks just\u201d (in Australia, a similar discretion exists under s\u00a0411(6) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act). This is a broad discretion that allows the court to modify a scheme, circumscribed only by what it deems just. One would imagine, however, that if the court proposes to make an amendment or a modification that would result in a substantive rather than, say, a procedural change, the court would in all likelihood refer the proposed change back to the scheme manager and the company\u2019s creditors or members for further consideration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, once the court gives its approval to a scheme, the scheme is binding on all the parties to the scheme (see also [43] above), and the scheme <i>cannot</i> <i>afterwards be</i> <i>altered</i>, even if the shareholders and the creditors of the company acquiesce in the alteration (see <i>Palmer</i>, vol\u00a02 at para\u00a012.032 (December 2006 release); <i>Buckley</i>, vol\u00a02 at para\u00a0425.63; <i>Gore-Browne</i>, vol\u00a02 at para\u00a046.30 (June 2005 release); <i>Srimati Premila Devi v Peoples Bank of Northern India, Ltd</i> [1938] 4\u00a0All\u00a0ER 337 (\u201c<i>Devi</i>\u201d); <i>Eltraco International Pte Ltd v Sennet Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2003] SGHC 40</nobr> (\u201c<i>Eltraco</i>\u201d); and <i>Chew Eu Hock Construction Co Pte Ltd v Central Provident Fund Board</i> <nobr>[2003] 4 SLR 137</nobr> (\u201c<i>Chew Eu Hock</i>\u201d)). The binding nature of the court\u2019s sanction is so wide-reaching that if the court sanctions a scheme which is beyond the capacity of the company or in conflict with other statutory provisions, the scheme is nonetheless still binding on the parties, notwithstanding that it is <i>ultra vires</i> the objects of the company (see <i>British and Commonwealth Holdings\u00a0plc v Barclays Bank\u00a0plc</i> [1996] 1\u00a0All\u00a0ER 381 (\u201c<i>British and Commonwealth Holdings\u00a0plc</i>\u201d)). However, it should be noted that the effect of the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine has been much diminished in Singapore because of ss\u00a023(1) and 25(1) of the Companies Act (see <i>Walter Woon</i> ([40] <i>supra</i>) at para\u00a03.76, as well as <i>Bee See &amp; Tay v Ong Hun Seang</i> <nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 193</nobr>, where this court held (at [61]) that \u201cs\u00a025 [of the Companies Act (Cap\u00a050, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed) was] so clear that there [was] no answer\u201d to the vendors\u2019 argument in that case that the company in question could not rely on its lack of capacity to take a transfer of property to invalidate the transfers).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, the court retains an inherent jurisdiction to amend or set aside a scheme in limited circumstances, for instance, if consent to the scheme was obtained by fraud (<i>Fletcher v Royal Automobile Club Ltd</i> <nobr>[2000] 1 BCLC 331</nobr>) or where there are obvious mistakes in the documents setting out the scheme (<i>Kempe</i> ([21] <i>supra</i>) at 276). It is also possible for a subsisting scheme of arrangement to be amended by another scheme approved by the court (see <i>Re Elliott\u2019s MF Services Pty Ltd</i> <nobr>[1965] VR 756</nobr>; <i>Re Application of Gasweld Pty Ltd</i> (1986) 5\u00a0NSWLR 494; and <i>Re Challenger Group Holdings Ltd</i> (2003) 48\u00a0ACSR 498).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thirdly, in line with the first two principles stated above, a creditor or member \u201cshould raise his objections at the hearing for court sanction and not any later\u201d (see <i>Walter Woon</i> at para\u00a016.18; see also <i>Eltraco</i> and <i>Chew Eu Hock</i>). As explained in <i>Chew Eu Hock</i>, the rationale for this principle is that any late objections after a scheme of arrangement has been approved by the court would be \u201c<i>unfair</i>, <i>unreasonable</i> and <i>prejudicial</i>\u201d [emphasis added] (at [26]) to the other parties to the scheme, and (more importantly) there is a need to ensure that there is <i>certainty</i> as to the validity of a court-approved scheme:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A consideration which I took into account was the defendants\u2019 failure to attend the creditors\u2019 meeting and voice the objections which they now seek to raise in Ng\u2019s affidavit. As was rightly pointed out by counsel for the JM [judicial manager], the defendants raised their objections <i>far too late</i> (on 17\u00a0December 2002), well after the order sanctioning the scheme had been obtained and lodged with the Registry of Companies pursuant to s\u00a0210(5) of the Companies Act [Cap\u00a050, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed]. <i>To accept the defendants\u2019 objections at such a late stage would be unfair, unreasonable and prejudicial to the JM, the new investor (Hiap Hoe) of the Company and to other creditors</i> <i>alike.</i> \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">\u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Australian decision of <i>Chief Commissioner of Pay-Roll Tax v Group Four Industries Pty Ltd</i> (1984) 8\u00a0ACLR 973 the plaintiff sought a declaration that he was not bound by the scheme of arrangement reached between the defendant company with certain of its creditors (and approved by the court under s\u00a0315(4)(b) of the Companies (NSW) Code), by virtue of his having statutory priority in a liquidation. McLelland\u00a0J at 976 refused the application and held that the Commissioner was bound as:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">otherwise, <i>despite approval by the court there could never be any certainty that a compromise or [an] arrangement was legally operative</i>, and it might remain open to collateral challenge indefinitely on grounds not susceptible to ready discovery or investigation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Consequently, McLelland\u00a0J held that once the court made an order under s\u00a0315(4)(b) approving a compromise or [an] arrangement and an office copy had been lodged with the Commission pursuant to s\u00a0315(12), the compromise or arrangement was binding, notwithstanding any defect or irregularity that [might] have occurred in the steps leading up to the making of the order. The judge further endorsed the comments of Hart\u00a0J in <i>Frick Australia Pty Ltd v Pen Pak Ocean Products Pty Ltd</i> [1971] Qd\u00a0R\u00a0286 that</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">\u201cthe public would never be safe in treating a scheme as valid and great inconvenience would result to companies, to creditors, to shareholders and to the community\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">if a court accepts the contention of a party that he is not bound by a scheme of arrangement approved by the court, on the ground that there had been no separate meeting of a distinct class of creditors to which he claimed to belong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With these established principles in mind, we turn now to address the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to extend the time for a creditor to file its proof of debt <i>after</i> the court has approved a scheme of arrangement. We will consider, first, the position under the Rules of Court. This will entail a review of the conflicting English and Australian approaches, as well as a consideration of the nature of schemes of arrangement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Whether the court has jurisdiction under the Rules of Court to extend the time for filing proofs of debt</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>The English approach</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It appears that the question of extension of time in the context of court-approved schemes has, to date, not arisen squarely in England. However, the Privy Council in <i>Kempe</i> ([21] <i>supra</i>), which concerned an appeal from Bermuda, considered the question in relation to a scheme of arrangement which had been approved by the Bermudian court under a similar statutory framework, namely, s\u00a099 of Bermuda\u2019s Companies Act 1981 (which is <i>in</i> <i>pari materia</i> with the UK s\u00a0425). Clause\u00a02.3.1 of the scheme in <i>Kempe</i> imposed a 21-day time limit for a creditor to apply to the court to reverse or vary any assessment by the liquidators of its claims. One of the creditors (\u201cAmbassador\u201d)</span> filed a notice of claim, the bulk of which was rejected by the liquidators. As a result of an administrative lapse, Ambassador failed to file a summons challenging the liquidators\u2019 decision within 21 days. It then sought an order that the time limit be extended (although <i>Kempe</i> concerned an extension of time for a creditor to file an appeal against a rejection of its claim as opposed to an extension of time for a creditor to file its claim (or proof of debt), the same principles should apply in both scenarios). The Court of Appeal of Bermuda granted Ambassador the extension of time sought. On appeal by the liquidators, the Privy Council reversed the Bermudian Court of Appeal\u2019s decision. Lord\u00a0Hoffmann, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, considered the nature of a scheme of arrangement before reaching the decision that a court had no jurisdiction to grant an extension of time. As the Judge\u2019s decision in the present case centred on the holding in <i>Kempe</i>, we reproduce below the relevant extracts from Lord\u00a0Hoffmann\u2019s judgment at 275\u2013276:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[T]he \u2026 question is whether it [the time limit laid down in cl\u00a02.3.1 of the scheme] has been \u201cfixed by any order of the court.\u201d On the answer to this question depends \u2026 whether [the court] has inherent jurisdiction to [extend time], \u2026 [which is] as Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0M.R. said in <i>Reg. v. Bloomsbury and Marylebone County Court, Ex parte Villerwest Ltd</i>. [1976] 1\u00a0W.L.R. 362, 365, a power \u201cto enlarge any time which a judge has ordered.\u201d Is the period of 21 days in clause\u00a02.3.1 a time which was ordered by the Chief Justice [of Bermuda] when he approved the scheme? In the [Bermudian] Court of Appeal, Kempster\u00a0J.A. thought that it was. He said that the clauses of the scheme would have been \u201cwithout effect\u201d but for the order of the Chief Justice giving the sanction of the court on 23\u00a0March 1993 and the subsequent delivery of that order to the registrar. Although the case was not cited to him, his view has the support of the decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in <i>Caratti v. Hillman</i> [1974] W.A.R.\u00a092. Jackson\u00a0C.J. said, at p.\u00a094, that the scheme was \u201can integral part of the court\u2019s order\u201d and Burt\u00a0J. said, at p.\u00a095, that \u201cthe rights [under the scheme] are ... in my opinion created by the order and the procedure whereby those rights are to be established or ascertained is a procedure which is also created by the order.\u201d Accordingly, the court could extend any period prescribed by the scheme under its power to extend periods fixed by its orders. The case has since been followed at first instance in Australia and in <i>Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd. v. State of Western Australia (No.\u00a02)</i> (1992) 7\u00a0W.A.R.\u00a061, 68 Anderson\u00a0J. said its reasoning was that \u201conce the order is made, it is the order, \u2018speaking in terms of the scheme\u2019 [<i>per</i> Burt\u00a0J. in <i>Caratti v. Hillman</i> at p.\u00a095] that has effect, not the resolution of the creditors and not the statute.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>Their Lordships respectfully disagree</i>. It is true that the sanction of the court is necessary for the scheme to become binding and that it takes effect when the order expressing that sanction is delivered to the registrar. <i>But this is not enough to enable one to say that the court (rather than the liquidators who proposed the scheme or the creditors who agreed to it) has by its order made the scheme. It is rather like saying that because royal assent is required for an Act of Parliament, a statute is an expression of the royal will</i>. Under section\u00a099 [of the Bermudian Companies Act] it is for the liquidators to propose the scheme, for the creditors by the necessary majority to agree to it and for the court to sanction it. <i>It is the statute which gives binding force to the scheme when there has been a combination of these three acts, just as the rules of the constitution give validity to [A]cts duly passed by the Queen in Parliament</i>: see <i>In re Garner\u2019s Motors Ltd</i>. [1937] Ch.\u00a0594, 598\u2013599 and <i>Devi v. People\u2019s Bank of Northern India Ltd</i>. [1938] 4\u00a0All\u00a0E.R. 337, 343.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Having held that a scheme of arrangement derived its efficacy from the statute and not from the court order sanctioning the scheme, Lord\u00a0Hoffmann went on to hold (at 276) that it was not open to a court to extend the time limits laid down in a scheme as this would be a <i>material alteration</i> that would detract from certainty and expedition, which were the chief objects of any scheme:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">It is of course true that the sanction of the court is by no means a formality. Furthermore, in giving its sanction, the court has an inherent jurisdiction to correct any obvious mistakes in the document which sets out the scheme. <i>But it cannot alter the substance of the scheme and impose upon the creditors an arrangement to which they did not agree. The question of whether the time limits in the scheme are fixed or flexible is in their Lordship\u2019s opinion one of substance</i>. Mr.\u00a0Crystal [counsel for Ambassador] accepts that if there is jurisdiction to enlarge the period for filing an appeal against the rejection of a claim, there must also have been jurisdiction to extend the final filing deadline for filing the original claims. But their Lordships think that <i>this would have been a material alteration, detracting from the certainty and expedition which were the chief objects of the scheme. If creditors felt that in providing fixed time limits the scheme was creating traps into which the unwary might fall, the time to raise this question was when the scheme was under consideration or by way of objection when the court was asked to give its sanction</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It will be noted, from the first of the two passages cited at [48] above, that Lord\u00a0Hoffmann relied on the cases of</span> <i>In re Garner\u2019s Motors, Limited</i> [1937] Ch\u00a0594 (\u201c<i>Re Garner\u2019s Motors</i>\u201d) and <i>Devi</i> ([44] <i>supra</i>) in support of the holding that a scheme of arrangement derived its efficacy from the statute. In <i>Re Garner\u2019s Motors</i>, the question before the court was whether a scheme of arrangement entered into between a creditor and one of its joint and several debtors would discharge the liability of the other joint and several debtor. In answering the question in the negative, Crossman\u00a0J considered the effect of the court\u2019s sanction of a scheme of arrangement at 598\u2013599 (in a passage which was subsequently cited by Lord\u00a0Hoffmann in <i>Kempe</i> at 276), as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>In my judgment the effect of s.\u00a0153 of the Companies Act, 1929</i> [(c\u00a023) (UK)]<i>, is to give to a scheme when sanctioned by the Court under the section a statutory operation</i>. The scheme when sanctioned by the Court becomes something quite different from a mere agreement signed by the parties. <i>It becomes a statutory scheme</i>. In my judgment, therefore, the discharge of Sentinel Waggon Works, Ld. [the debtor which entered into the scheme of arrangement], from the debt to Temple Press, Ld. [the creditor], which was effected under clause\u00a015 of the scheme sanctioned by the Court on March\u00a023, 1936, did not have the effect of discharging Garner\u2019s Motors, Ld. [the other joint and several debtor of the creditor], from its liability in respect of the debt. It is settled law that a discharge of one of several judgment-debtors by operation of law does not release the other debtors. <i>But in my judgment the effect of s.\u00a0153 of the Companies Act, 1929, is to give a scheme when sanctioned by the Court a statutory operation</i>. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Devi</i>, the directors of an Indian bank (\u201cthe bank\u201d) purported to forfeit the appellants\u2019 shares in the bank by reason of the appellants\u2019 non-payment upon the bank\u2019s calls on these shares. The calls on the shares had been made via a resolution that was passed in complete ignorance of the terms of an amended scheme of arrangement that had been approved by the court. The bank contended on appeal that the forfeitures had subsequently been ratified by the whole body of its creditors and shareholders. The Privy Council held that the forfeitures were <i>ultra vires</i> the bank as a court-approved scheme could not be amended or departed from by the mere acquiescence of the company\u2019s shareholders and creditors. The Privy Council held (<i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Romer) at 343, in a passage which was subsequently relied upon by Lord\u00a0Hoffmann in <i>Kempe</i> (at 276), as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>Upon confirmation by the court of the amended scheme of arrangement, that scheme became, by virtue of sect.\u00a0153 of the Indian Companies Act, binding upon the creditors, the shareholders and the bank alike. Its terms could thereafter only be varied by order of the court after the variation had been approved at meetings of the creditors and shareholders</i>. It was not, therefore, possible for the bank or its directors or shareholders, whether by resolution or ratification or otherwise, to alter the dates fixed by cl.\u00a06 of the scheme for payment of the 20\u00a0per cent. called up in Mar., 1932, or the 5\u00a0per cent. called up on Jan.\u00a018, 1933. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In contrast to Crossman\u00a0J\u2019s judgment in <i>Re Garner\u2019s Motors</i> (see the passage quoted at [49] above), it would appear that the above passage in <i>Devi</i> does not quite support Lord\u00a0Hoffmann\u2019s holding in <i>Kempe</i> that a scheme of arrangement derives its efficacy from the statute, although it emphasises the corollary point that a court-approved scheme is binding on all parties to the scheme. <span lang=\"EN-AU\">However, we note that in an English work published before the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Kempe</i> (namely, David Brown, <i>Corporate Rescue: Insolvency Law in Practice</i> (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996)), the learned author cited (at para\u00a018.54) the two cases of <i>Re Garner\u2019s Motors</i> and <i>Devi</i> as authority for the proposition that the effect of the court\u2019s approval of a scheme of arrangement was as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>The scheme, founded originally in contract, becomes statutory</i> and thus cannot be altered by contractual agreement, other than by a supplemental scheme sanctioned by the court. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned at [48] above, it appears that, to date, the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to extend the time for filing proofs of debt in respect of a court-approved scheme has not directly arisen for consideration in England whether before or after the Privy Council\u2019s decision in <i>Kempe</i>. <i>Kempe</i> has, however, been followed by the Hong Kong courts in two cases, <i>viz</i>,</span> <i>Re Universal Dockyard Ltd</i> <nobr>[2003] 3 HKEC 893</nobr> and <i>Re UDL Holdings Ltd</i> <nobr>[2006] 3 HKLRD 84</nobr><span lang=\"EN-AU\">. In both cases, the Hong Kong High Court simply unquestioningly accepted the holding in <i>Kempe</i> as correct, and no (or little) comments were made in relation to Lord\u00a0Hoffmann\u2019s judgment (see</span> <i>Re Universal Dockyard Ltd</i> at [20] and <i>Re UDL Holdings Ltd</i> at [58]<span lang=\"EN-AU\">).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Kempe</i> is also cited by the learned authors of <i>Buckley</i></span> ([43] <i>supra</i>) <span lang=\"EN-AU\">for the following proposition (at vol\u00a02, para\u00a0425.64):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">A scheme does not operate as an agreement between the parties affected but <i>it has binding force by virtue of statute</i> once an application to the court has been made and the consent of the relevant parties and the sanction of the court [have] been obtained. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><i>Kempe</i> is likewise cited by the learned authors of <i>Gore-Browne</i> ([43] <i>supra</i>) for a similar proposition (at vol\u00a02, para\u00a046.30 (June 2005 release)):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">It has been held that, although a scheme of arrangement requires the court\u2019s approval, it is not made solely by reason of the court\u2019s order.

In <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Caratti</span></i>, cl\u00a09(e) of a court-approved scheme provided that any creditor whose claim was rejected by the scheme manager had 14 days to commence legal proceedings, failing which the creditor \u201cshall be forever barred from bringing any such proceedings\u201d. The scheme manager sent letters to three creditors informing them that their claims were not admitted, and these letters, together with the relevant documents, were subsequently forwarded by the creditors to their solicitors. The letters and documents were, unfortunately, mislaid in the solicitors\u2019 office, and by the time they were discovered, the 14-day time limit laid down in cl\u00a09(e) of the scheme for commencing legal proceedings had expired. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Western Australia, the lower court\u2019s refusal to grant the three creditors an extension of time to commence legal proceedings was reversed and an extension of time granted. Jackson\u00a0CJ held at 93\u201394:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">\u2026 I have reached the conclusion, in agreement with the other members of this court, that <i>we have power to extend the time under O.\u00a03, r.\u00a05 of the Supreme Court Rules</i> [the Western Australian equivalent of O\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court] which are made applicable to proceedings under the Companies Act by r.\u00a04 of the Supreme Court (Companies) Rules 1963. \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>[I]n my view, the approved scheme is an integral part of the court\u2019s order [such] that the time fixed by cl.\u00a09(e) of the scheme is a period within which \u201ca person is \u2026 authorized\u201d by that order \u201cto do any act in any proceedings\u201d, to quote the words of O.\u00a03, r.\u00a05(1) of the Supreme Court Rules</i>.

However, as rightly pointed out by Mr\u00a0Ashok Kumar, counsel for Reliance, it appears that Austin\u00a0J in the latter case preferred the approach in <i>Kempe</i> ([21] <i>supra</i>), but followed <i>Caratti</i> as a matter of precedent. This can be seen from the following passage in <i>Ray Brooks Pty Ltd</i> (at [88]\u2013[90]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The issue was addressed, admittedly in a different context, in <i>Caratti v Hillman</i> <nobr>[1974] WAR 92</nobr>; (1973) 4\u00a0ACLR 170. <i>In that case the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia took the view that the procedure leading to the extinguishment of rights of creditors under a scheme of arrangement under companies legislation was a procedure created by order of the court</i>. The order approving the scheme of arrangement fixed the period within which a creditor was authorised to lodge a claim under the scheme. <i>Therefore the order of the court approving the scheme was an order fixing the period within which a person was authorised to do an act, for the purposes of the rule of court comparable with Pt\u00a04, r\u00a04</i> [of the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), which is <i>in pari materia</i> with O\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court]<i>. Consequently the rule of court was available to permit the court to extend the period for lodgment of claims by creditors</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">That reasoning has been accepted by later Australian cases on several occasions: <i>Re Terri Co Pty Ltd</i> (1987) 12\u00a0ACLR 457; <i>Bond Corp Holdings Ltd v Western Australia (No\u00a02)</i> (1992) 7\u00a0WAR 61; 7\u00a0ACSR 472; <i>Re Matine Ltd</i> (1998) 28\u00a0ACSR 268. However, it is inconsistent with the reasoning of the Privy Council in <i>Kempe</i> \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>The reasoning of Lord\u00a0Hoffmann [in Kempe] is highly persuasive. However, the approach taken in Caratti was the approach of an intermediate appellate court in Australia. According to the High Court in Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd (1993) 177\u00a0CLR 485; 112\u00a0ALR 627; 10\u00a0ACSR 230, a judge at first instance in this country should not depart from the interpretation of companies legislation adopted by an Australian intermediate appellate court</i>. Moreover, the <i>Caratti</i> decision has stood since 1973 and has been followed, as I have said, on several occasions. I note, in particular, that although Santow\u00a0J found it unnecessary to choose between <i>Caratti</i> and <i>Kempe</i> in <i>Re Matine</i>, he expressed the view (at 286) that he would follow the Australian cases were [it] necessary to do so. <i>As a matter of precedent, therefore, I shall follow the reasoning in Caratti in preference to the reasoning in Kempe</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also note with some interest that an approach not unlike that taken in <i>Carrati</i> was adopted by the Bermudian Court of Appeal in <i>Ambassador Insurance Company v Charles W\u00a0Kempe and Nigel Hamilton</i> Civil Appeal No\u00a013 of 1995 (14\u00a0March 1996) (unreported) (whose decision was, however, reversed in <i>Kempe</i> on further appeal to the Privy Council), where it was held that a scheme of arrangement derived its efficacy from the court order sanctioning that scheme:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Though the Scheme makes no provision for extension of [the] time [period] within which to appeal against the rejection of a claim in the liquidation <i>its clauses would be without effect but for the delivery to the Registrar of the Order of the Chief Justice made on 23\u00a0March 1993</i> [<i>ie</i>, the court order sanctioning the scheme] as subsection\u00a0(3) of section\u00a099 of the [Bermudian Companies] Act makes clear. \u2026 Section\u00a0157 of the Companies Winding-up Rules, which is applicable under clause\u00a08.1.1 [of the scheme of arrangement] and allows the Court to extend \u201cthe time \u2026 fixed by <i>any order of the Court</i> for doing any act\u201d, may therefore be invoked by Ambassador \u2026 to extend any time limits which a judge has ordered whether or not a creditor\u2019s rights have notionally been extinguished. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Which approach should prevail in Singapore?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before giving our reasons as to why we preferred the Australian approach, we first need to address Reliance\u2019s submission (see [26] above) that \u201c[t]he Singapore Court of Appeal ha[d] <i>affirmed</i> that a scheme of arrangement [was] a <i>statutory contract</i> entered into between the company and scheme creditors\u201d<a id=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 6]</span></span></a> [emphasis added] in <i>Daewoo</i> ([26] <i>supra</i>). If Reliance\u2019s submission is correct, it would mean that the question of the nature of a scheme of arrangement (and the related question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to extend the time for a creditor to file its proof of debt where the court has already approved the scheme) has already been decided in Singapore. The passage relied on by Reliance for its submission is to be found at [24] of <i>Daewoo</i> (<i>per</i> Yong Pung How\u00a0CJ):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">It is trite law that, where a scheme of arrangement or compromise \u2026 is approved by <i>all</i> the creditors of the company, it is binding on the company as well as its creditors. In such a case, there is no need on the part of the company to invoke s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act [Cap\u00a050, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed]. <i>The scheme is wholly a contractual scheme</i>. Where, as is usually the case, it is not practical or practicable to secure the unanimous agreement of all the creditors, s\u00a0210 is invoked. And when s\u00a0210 is invoked, and the scheme is approved by the requisite majority of the creditors and the court, the scheme becomes binding on all the creditors or the class of creditors (as the case may be). That is provided in s\u00a0210(3) of the Act. <b><i>The binding effect of the scheme is given by the court order approving the scheme</i></b>. As Street\u00a0J said in <i>Re Norfolk Island and Byron Bay Whaling Co</i> (1969) 90\u00a0WN\u00a0(Pt\u00a01) (NSW) 351 at 354 with reference to s\u00a0181 of the Companies Act 1961 of the State of New South Wales (which is the equivalent of our s\u00a0210), the section is intended to provide a machinery (1)\u00a0for overcoming the impossibility or impracticability of obtaining the individual consent of every member of the class intended to be bound thereby, and (2)\u00a0for preventing, in appropriate circumstances, a minority of class members [from] frustrating a beneficial scheme. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, we do not see how the above passage could even begin to remotely support Reliance\u2019s submission. If anything, Yong\u00a0CJ went only as far as to say that a scheme of arrangement, when approved by all the creditors of the company, was a \u201ccontractual scheme\u201d (<i>Daewoo</i> at [24]); he did not describe such a scheme as, to use Reliance\u2019s words, a \u201cstatutory contract\u201d. In fact, the words in bold italics in the quotation from <i>Daewoo</i> (at [58] above) would appear to support the <i>Australian</i> position that a scheme of arrangement derives its efficacy from the <i>court order</i> approving that scheme. We note that the Judge, in arriving at her decision that the English approach was more persuasive, appeared to have found some penumbral encouragement in Yong\u00a0CJ\u2019s comments in <i>Daewoo</i> (see the GD at [30]), but she certainly did not go as far as to say that <i>Daewoo</i> <i>decided</i> that a scheme of arrangement was in the nature of a statutory contract. If the Judge had regarded <i>Daewoo</i> as laying down such a legal principle, there would have been no need for her to elaborate (at length) on her reasons for adopting the English approach. As such, we rejected Reliance\u2019s submission on what this court held in <i>Daewoo vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the nature of a scheme of arrangement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note, however, that in <i>Eltraco</i> ([44] <i>supra</i>), a High Court decision concerning the scope and the operation of a scheme of arrangement, MPH\u00a0Rubin\u00a0J held at [23] that the effect of a court-approved scheme was as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The effects of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement came up for discussion in New South Wales in <i>Hill v Anderson Meat Industries Ltd</i> <nobr>[1971] 1 NSWLR 868</nobr> as well as before the Singapore Court of Appeal in <i>Daewoo</i> ... <i>Both Street\u00a0J in Hill v Anderson and Yong Pung How\u00a0CJ in Daewoo reaffirmed the view that a scheme of arrangement duly passed and sanctioned by the court inherited a <b>statutory effect</b> upon the relationship between the debtor company and its creditors</i>. <span lang=\"EN-AU\">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">The above passage may plausibly be read as suggesting that a scheme of arrangement derives its efficacy from the statute (which is the English position). However, as clarified at [59] above, the decision in <i>Daewoo</i> certainly does not stand for this proposition. As for the New South Wales case of <i>Hill v Anderson Meat Industries Ltd</i> <nobr>[1971] 1 NSWLR 868</nobr>, that case was, in fact, relied on by Burt\u00a0J in <i>Caratti</i> ([54] <i>supra</i>) at 95 and by Santow\u00a0J in <i>Re AGL Gas Networks</i> ([55] <i>supra</i>) at [46] for the contrary (Australian) position that a scheme of arrangement derives its efficacy from the court order approving the scheme. One should, therefore, be slow to read <i>Eltraco</i> as <i>correctly</i> supporting the proposition (and also the English position) that a scheme of arrangement derives its efficacy from the statute and operates as a statutory contract.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We noted earlier (at [25] above) that the Judge justified her preference for the English approach on the basis that the purpose of s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act, the established principles relating to schemes of arrangement and the overarching need for clarity, certainty and finality in this area of the law cumulatively supported the position in <i>Kempe</i> ([21] <i>supra</i>). Nevertheless, we are of the view that the Australian approach is also consistent with these established principles. Adopting the Australian approach does not necessarily mean that clarity, certainty and finality would be sacrificed on the altar of expediency or that the objectives of s\u00a0210 can no longer be properly achieved. Between the English and the Australian approaches, we are not entirely comfortable with the former approach, which, with respect, appears to be unnecessarily strict and mechanical, leading perhaps to potentially unjust consequences in some instances. We now elaborate on the reasons for our decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The English approach will invariably mean that once the court has approved a scheme of arrangement, it no longer has jurisdiction to grant an extension of time for a creditor to file its proof of debts in respect of that scheme <i>regardless</i> of the circumstances, save in cases of \u201c<i>obvious mistakes</i> in the document which sets out the scheme\u201d [emphasis added] (<i>Kempe</i> at 276 (see the second of the two passages reproduced at [48] above)) or where consent to the scheme was obtained by fraud (see the GD at [38], citing <i>Fletcher v Royal Automobile Club Ltd</i> ([45] <i>supra</i>)). This seems intuitively restrictive as it is not difficult to envisage a situation, such as that in <i>Caratti</i> ([54] <i>supra</i>) or in the other Australian cases cited at [55]\u2013[56] above (we will elaborate on the factual matrices of those cases below at [71]\u2013[78]), where the failure to file a claim in time is not in any way attributable to the fault of the creditor and where allowing the creditor an extension of time to file its claim does not prejudice any of the parties, and yet (under the English approach), an extension of time cannot be granted because there is no obvious mistake in the documents setting out the scheme or no fraud. Perhaps, on the facts of <i>Kempe</i>, the Privy Council\u2019s decision can arguably be said not to be unduly harsh or unfair, given that the Privy Council had found, as a <i>fact</i>, that it was a \u201c<i>principal feature</i>\u201d [emphasis added] (<i>id</i> at 273) of the scheme in question to impose a strict deadline for filing claims, after which creditors would be altogether barred from participating in the liquidation. (By logical implication, that feature of the scheme in <i>Kempe</i> would entail that the deadline for a creditor to apply to court to challenge the liquidators\u2019 decision in respect of its claim likewise had to be strictly observed.) However, the same cannot be said for all other schemes of arrangement without such a feature. We would reiterate here that, as a general principle, the court should be slow to abdicate the powers conferred on it by s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> schemes of arrangement, especially when doing so would allow an injustice to stand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Santow\u00a0J in <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([55] <i>supra</i>)</span> pointed out at [46] that <i>Kempe</i> proceeded on \u201cattackable reasoning\u201d which was \u201cvulnerable\u201d (see the passage quoted at [55] above). Referring to the assumption that a scheme of arrangement derived its efficacy from the statute and not from the court order sanctioning it, Santow\u00a0J persuasively argued that if this approach was taken to its logical conclusion, it would produce \u201cincongruous consequences\u201d (<i>Re AGL Gas Networks</i> at [46]). He drew an analogy with the court\u2019s statutorily-conferred jurisdiction to illustrate his argument, pointing out that \u201c[t]he fact that the [court\u2019s] jurisdiction is conferred by statute does not make any decisions of the court under the statutory jurisdiction any less orders of the court deriving their efficacy from being made\u201d (<i>ibid</i>). According to Santow\u00a0J, the statute might be an indispensable statutory prerequisite to the existence of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, but it was nonetheless \u201ca \u2018background\u2019 fact\u201d (<i>ibid</i>) behind that efficacy, and to say that it was the statute which gave a court order its binding authority \u201c[was] like saying that the birth of Lee Harvey Oswald \u2018caused\u2019 the death of President\u00a0Kennedy\u201d (<i>ibid</i>). While we see the merit in Santow J\u2019s analogy in <i>Re AGL Gas Networks</i>, the same cannot be said about the analogy of royal assent given by the Privy Council in <i>Kempe</i> to support its holding that a scheme of arrangement derived its efficacy from the statute. The Privy Council had (at 276 (see the first of the two passages quoted at [48] above)) likened the court\u2019s sanction of schemes of arrangement to royal assent to Acts of the UK parliament; the fact that royal assent was required for an Act did not make the statute an expression of royal will and, likewise, the same reasoning applied to the court\u2019s sanction of schemes of arrangement. We note that this analogy is apt only if the court\u2019s sanction of a scheme is regarded as a <i>mere formality</i> like the royal assent required for UK Acts. However, as we have seen (at [43] above), cases (including English ones) have established that the court\u2019s sanction is not just a formality and that the court, in fact, has a crucial role to play in deciding whether a scheme is to be approved. Further, under the Singapore and the Australian provisions governing schemes of arrangement, the court has the expressly-defined power to impose such conditions on or make such amendments to the terms of a scheme as it deems fit before approving any scheme (see s\u00a0210(4) of the Companies Act (reproduced at [31] above) and s\u00a0411(6) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act (reproduced at [35] above); the significance of these provisions will be dealt with in greater detail shortly). In the light of this, we do not see how (at least in Singapore and Australia) the court\u2019s sanction of schemes of arrangement can be approximated to royal assent to Acts of the UK parliament. Another flaw in the reasoning in <i>Kempe</i> is exposed by the facts of the case itself. This was astutely pointed out by Santow\u00a0J in <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">at [46] (see the passage quoted at [55]</span> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">above), where he noted</span> that the scheme in <i>Kempe</i> allowed a dissatisfied scheme creditor to apply to the court in respect of certain decisions made by the liquidators, and their Lordships had proceeded on the basis that there was nothing untoward in this. However, if indeed a court loses all jurisdiction in respect of a scheme of arrangement once it has sanctioned the scheme (save for its inherent jurisdiction to intervene in cases of fraud or obvious mistakes in the documents setting out the scheme), this begs the question of where the court obtains the necessary jurisdiction to exercise the appellate function conferred by the scheme in <i>Kempe</i>. We agree with Santow\u00a0J that if a scheme of arrangement operates as an order of court instead of as a statutory contract, no such difficulty arises since the jurisdiction of the court to vary an order which it made earlier would continue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Crucially, the approach adopted in <i>Kempe</i> does not comport with the plain <i>wording</i> of the relevant UK, Australian and Singapore provisions on schemes of arrangement, all of which stipulate that a scheme becomes <i>binding</i> only \u201c<i>if sanctioned by the court</i>\u201d (s\u00a0425(2) of the 1985 UK Companies Act (see [35] above)) or if it is \u201c<i>approved by order of the Court</i>\u201d (s\u00a0411(4) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act (see [35] above) and s\u00a0210(3) of the Companies Act (see [31]) above)). The plain wording of these subsections would suggest that the efficacy of a scheme (or, at least, its binding nature, which is the key to the ability of a scheme of arrangement to fulfil its intended function of serving as machinery to overcome the impossibility of obtaining the individual consent of every creditor or member to a proposed scheme) stems from the court order which sanctions or approves it. This is <i>all the more so</i> under the Australian and the Singapore provisions, which use the specific words \u201c<i>order</i> of the Court\u201d. Further, under the Australian and the Singapore provisions, there are specific subsections (namely, s\u00a0411(6) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act (see [35] above) and s\u00a0210(4) of the Companies Act (see [31] above)) that stipulate that the court \u201cmay grant its approval to a compromise or [an] arrangement <i>subject to such alterations or conditions as it thinks just</i>\u201d [emphasis added]. We accept that these provisions only allow a court to substantially amend the terms of a scheme <i>before</i> the court\u2019s approval of the scheme is given and, contrary to what counsel for Oriental contended, do not go as far as to allow the court to amend the terms of a scheme <i>after</i> approving the scheme. As seen earlier (at [44] above), it is an established principle that the terms of a scheme cannot be substantially amended (save in exceptional circumstances) after it has been approved by the court. However, these provisions do nonetheless somewhat reinforce the view that under the Australian and the Singapore companies legislation, the courts are allowed a more active participatory role in respect of schemes of arrangement as compared to the position under the UK\u2019s companies legislation, given that there is no equivalent of s\u00a0210(4) of the Companies Act or s\u00a0411(6) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act in the 1985 UK Companies Act. It would seem incongruous that the court has such wide powers to amend the terms of a scheme before giving its approval to the scheme, but promptly loses all jurisdiction after it approves the scheme. A more tenable view would be that a scheme, when approved by the court, takes effect as an order of court and, like any other court order, can be varied, but only in deserving circumstances (which we will elaborate on at [70]\u2013[82] below).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we note that the Privy Council in <i>Kempe</i> considered the amendment of time limits laid down in a scheme of arrangement to be one of <i>substance</i> and, thus, a \u201cmaterial alteration\u201d (<i>id</i> at 276). Accordingly, the Privy Council dismissed Ambassador\u2019s application for an extension of time. As emphasised at [44] above, it is an established principle that a scheme cannot be altered after the court\u2019s sanction has been given to it so as to impose upon the creditors or the members an arrangement to which they did not agree. With respect, however, it is doubtful, to say the least, whether an extension of time to file a proof of debt (or to commence legal proceedings in respect of the liquidator\u2019s decision on a proof of debt, as in the case of <i>Kempe</i>) should be treated, in the first place, as a material alteration or amendment of the substance of a court-approved scheme. It also appears to us that the Privy Council in <i>Kempe</i> did not consider this point carefully, but merely accepted it as a valid assumption (<i>id</i> at 276). In contrast to the cases cited at [44] above (namely, <i>Devi</i>, <i>British and Commonwealth Holdings plc</i>, <i>Eltraco</i> and <i>Chew Eu Hock</i>, all of which support the above-mentioned established principle), where the creditors in question (or, on the facts of <i>Devi</i>, the directors of the debtor company) sought to amend or object to the substantive terms of a court-approved scheme such that they were, in fact, trying to <i>resile</i> from the original scheme which had been agreed to by the requisite majority of supporting creditors and sanctioned by the court, the applicant in an extension of time case (such as Oriental in the present appeal) is usually not trying to substantially amend or resile from the scheme that it has entered into. <i>In fact, the applicant in such a scenario usually wholeheartedly supports the court-approved scheme and wants to take part in it, and the purpose of seeking an extension of a time limit laid down in the scheme is precisely for the purpose of participating in the scheme</i>. It appears that the significance of this distinction was also, at least partially, appreciated by the Judge in the proceedings below when she noted (at [37] of the GD):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">While <i>the applicant in the present case [ie, Oriental] did not seek to amend the scheme</i>, in my view, the principles governing this issue are important as they form another part of the framework in which the issue should be analysed. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">A better view, perhaps, is to treat an extension of time in respect of a court-approved scheme simply as a matter of <i>procedure</i>, rather than as a matter going to the substance or materiality of the commercial dimension of the scheme (an amendment of the latter nature would entail seeking the views of all the parties bound by the scheme). We note that Santow\u00a0J himself in <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([55] <i>supra</i>)</span> accepted (at [47]) the submission that in making an order to extend the time for the plaintiff company in that case to comply with a particular condition stipulated in a court-approved scheme, \u201c[the court] would not be amending the scheme as such as it [<i>ie</i>, the extension of time] would not involve a change to any <i>substantive</i> provision of the scheme\u201d [emphasis added]. If the view that an extension of time is usually a matter of procedure is accepted, then the grant of an extension of time will not be seen as detracting from the established principle that a court-approved scheme should not be altered in substance. An application for an extension of time after the court has approved a scheme should then likewise not be viewed as being tantamount to raising a late objection to the scheme that will jeopardise the certainty of the scheme\u2019s validity (see, in this regard, [46] above).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viewed in this light, the Australian approach is in no way inconsistent with the established principles relating to schemes of arrangement, and also gives due consideration to the overarching need for clarity, certainty and finality in this area of the law (a point made briefly earlier at [61] above). We would also add, in respect of the latter concern, that a court order is in no way less binding than a statutory contract on the parties to a scheme of arrangement, and it is trite law as well as common sense that a court order cannot be altered at will by the parties who are subject to the order. As such, it is hard to see, with due respect, why there would invariably be less commercial certainty if the Australian approach is adopted: Any court order, once finalised, can only be amended in very limited circumstances, and any application to amend a court order would be subject to due process. It follows from the binding nature of a court order that the Australian approach can also achieve the legislative intent that schemes of arrangement should function as machinery to overcome the impossibility of attaining absolute consensus from all the company\u2019s creditors or members on a proposed scheme and to bind minority dissentients to the scheme.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is also no reason why the Australian approach cannot embrace the legal concept that a <span lang=\"EN-AU\">scheme of arrangement which is approved by <i>all</i> the creditors of a company</span> \u201c<span lang=\"EN-AU\">is wholly a <i>contractual</i> scheme</span>\u201d [emphasis added] (<i>Daewoo</i> ([26] <i>supra</i>) at [24]); the court order sanctioning such a scheme (<i>ie</i>, a scheme which is approved by all of the company\u2019s creditors) can be seen, in essence, as a <i>consensual order</i>. Viewed in this light, the sanctity of contract which lies at the heart of a scheme that has been duly approved by the company\u2019s creditors or members is preserved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further, the Australian approach will have the added advantages of:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding a strained construction of the plain wording of s\u00a0210(3) of the Companies Act, which, as demonstrated above at [64], suggests that a scheme of arrangement is made binding only upon its approval by the court; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 avoiding the unfairness or injustice which may potentially be caused to an innocent creditor who is not to be blamed for its failure to file its proof of debt in time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note that the Judge did not take the view that the Australian approach was wrong; rather, she decided that \u201cthe English position [was] more persuasive\u201d (see the GD at [32]). The question of whether the court has jurisdiction to extend time in respect of a court-approved scheme is essentially a question of discretion, and invariably requires a judge to take a considered view on what best accords with the need for commercial certainty and fairness in this area of the law. The Judge was unduly concerned with the overarching need for clarity, certainty and finality (all of which are crucial to the efficacious implementation of schemes of arrangement), and thus mistakenly concluded that anything less than the strict English approach would be undesirable. However, as we have shown, there are real practical conundrums with the strict English approach, and the reasoning in <i>Kempe</i> is, with respect, sharply flawed. On the other hand, adopting the Australian approach does not necessarily entail sacrificing clarity, certainty and finality. In fact, the Australian approach mitigates some of the injustice that may potentially result under the English approach. It also gives due consideration to the established principles relating to schemes of arrangement while meeting, at the same time, the objectives of the legislative framework governing such schemes. We have therefore adopted the Australian approach as according with both the underlying policy and the objectives of s\u00a0210 of the Companies Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Circumstances where the court\u2019s jurisdiction to extend time will be exercised</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having adopted the Australian approach, it would be helpful to provide some guidelines as to when the court should exercise its jurisdiction in favour of extending the time for a creditor to file its proof of debt (or extending other time limits prescribed in a scheme of arrangement) in respect of a court-approved scheme. Before doing so, it would be helpful to examine the factual matrices of the Australian cases in which such extensions of time have been granted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>(1)\u00a0The Australian cases</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We begin first with the case of <i>Caratti</i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([54] <i>supra</i>). As mentioned earlier (at [54] above),</span> in <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Caratti</span></i>, three creditors under a court-approved scheme filed their claims in time, but failed to commence proceedings for a review of the scheme manager\u2019s decision to reject their claims (\u201creview proceedings\u201d) within 14 days of the notice of rejection as stipulated in the scheme. It transpired that the scheme manager had sent letters to those creditors informing them that their claims had not been admitted, and the letters, together with the relevant documents, had been forwarded by the creditors to their solicitors. <i>The letters and the documents were, unfortunately, mislaid in the office of the creditors\u2019 solicitors</i>, and by the time they were discovered, the 14-day time period for commencing review proceedings had expired.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As noted by Wallace\u00a0J at 96, the creditors\u2019 failure to commence review proceedings in time was due to an \u201caccident\u201d. Given those circumstances, the Supreme Court of Western Australia reversed the decision of Wickham\u00a0J in the court below and granted the three creditors an extension of time to commence review proceedings. Besides the fact that the creditors themselves were not to be blamed for failing to commence review proceedings in time, (more importantly) the court took into consideration the fact that no prejudice would be suffered by any party bound by the scheme if an extension of time was granted, <i>given that no distribution had been made yet under the scheme</i>. In fact, a refusal to grant an extension would have disadvantaged the three creditors. As Burt\u00a0J explained at 95:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>If, as I think is the case, there is power to extend the time, then a sound exercise of the discretion on the facts of this case requires that it be exercised</i>. It may be that in some cases the extension would be granted on terms, i.e., that if the debt be established, the claimant is to be excluded from any distribution made before that date. <i>In the present case however no distribution has been made and on the merits of the case the scheme manager does not oppose the making of an unconditional order. To refuse to make such an order might have the effect of a creditor\u2019s debt being released with no compensating advantage. This is not the idea of the scheme, or as Brightman,\u00a0J., put it in Re NFU Development Trust, [1972] 1\u00a0W.L.R. 1548, at p.\u00a01555; [1973] 1\u00a0All\u00a0E.R. 135: \u201cConfiscation is not my idea of an arrangement.\u201d</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second case, <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([55] <i>supra</i>), concerned a scheme of amalgamation and reconstruction of a gas company (\u201cAGL\u201d) and its related companies. The scheme was perceived to have numerous advantages such as eliminating the duplication of record-keeping, accounting and maintenance procedures and bringing about greater flexibility and potential for improved growth for the whole organisation. The scheme was approved by an order of court made on 6\u00a0June 1994, and other related orders were also made at the same time to provide for the</span> transfer of all the properties, powers and liabilities of the subsidiary companies to their parent company. The relevant orders (other than the order approving the scheme) were all subjected to certain conditions precedent stipulated in the scheme. Six years after the orders were made (and the scheme effected), it was discovered that the scheme had never become operative as one of the conditions precedent, <i>viz</i>, the amendment of AGL\u2019s then existing authorisation under the Gas Industry Restructuring Act 1986 (NSW) (\u201cthe NSW Gas Act\u201d) before midnight on 30\u00a0June 1994, had never been fulfilled (AGL had received notification of its amended authorisation a few seconds after midnight on 1\u00a0July 1994). In the words of Santow\u00a0J (at [2]), \u201c[t]he non-fulfilment [of the condition precedent] was <i>technical in the extreme</i> and <i>entirely accidental</i>\u201d [emphasis added].</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, Santow\u00a0J found that it would have been <i>impossible</i> in the first place for that condition precedent (<i>ie</i>, the amendment of AGL\u2019s then existing authorisation under the NSW Gas Act before midnight on 30\u00a0June 1994) to be fulfilled. He explained (at [5]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[T]he formulation of that condition and in consequence the 1994 court orders, was inherently circular in its terms. <i>Thus fulfilment of the scheme condition depended on the scheme transfer of assets while the scheme transfer of assets depended on fulfilment of the scheme condition. On that basis, the 1994 orders read literally could never bring the scheme into effect</i>. This was contrary to the expectation of all involved in the scheme process, including, it can be assumed, the judge\u2019s. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Consequently, Santow\u00a0J found that the parties had been labouring under a mistake of fact as to the fulfilment of the condition precedent (at [33]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">I infer from all the evidence before me that at the hearing on 6\u00a0June 1994, the plaintiff [AGL] and its representatives honestly and reasonably believed that all the conditions precedent (including the requirement for the authorisation held by the plaintiff to be amended) were capable of being satisfied and would be satisfied prior to midnight on 30\u00a0June 1994. The court was not misled deliberately in relation to the orders that were sought. <i>Instead both the parties and the court were operating under a mistake of fact</i> (that is, that the authorisation would be obtained prior to midnight on 30\u00a0June 1994). [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In these circumstances, one of the questions before Santow\u00a0J was whether the court could, pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), amend the orders made on 6\u00a0June 1994 and extend the time for AGL to obtain amendment of its authorisation under the NSW Gas Act to 10 minutes after midnight on 30\u00a0June 1994 so that the unfulfilled condition precedent would be retrospectively satisfied. As seen above (at [55]), Santow\u00a0J held that the court had the jurisdiction to do so since the efficacy of the scheme was derived from an order of court. Besides taking into account the fact that the non-compliance in question was technical and accidental, Santow\u00a0J also considered the question of prejudice before concluding that the court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant an extension of time should be exercised in that case. At the outset, he made the following observation (at [3]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b><i>What now is to be done?</i> <i>Clearly no-one would be prejudiced if the scheme were able to be rendered operative, along with the consequential steps purportedly taken</i></b>. If possible this should be retroactive, though that involves an element of retrospective fiction. Indeed if it were <i>not</i> possible to achieve that rectification and validation, <b><i>prejudice would flow both for the AGL group of companies, and the many who have dealt with it on the assumption that the scheme was effective</i></b>. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Further in his judgment, Santow\u00a0J made the following essential findings of fact (at [21]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">I find as a matter of fact that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As at about one second past midnight on 30\u00a0June 1994 and thereafter, the plaintiff [AGL] and the subsidiary companies (to the extent that the effectiveness of their dissolution and other associated steps is questioned) <i>acted on the basis that the conditions precedent to the scheme of arrangement and the court orders had been complied with so that the scheme was assumed to be operative</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After midnight on 30\u00a0June 1994, <i>the affairs of the plaintiff and the subsidiary companies have been conducted on the assumption that the scheme and its associated steps have been fully implemented</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the event the court is able to and does make orders validating, rectifying or confirming the validity of the scheme and its associated steps retroactively, <i>no injustice will be occasioned to any person now or in the future</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If no such orders are made, then <i>substantial injustice in the form of inconvenience, cost and confusion will inevitably be occasioned to the scheme companies, their ultimate shareholders, customers and to the public generally in so far as it has dealings with the scheme companies</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In essence, Santow\u00a0J was satisfied that no prejudice would be caused to any of the parties bound by the scheme if an extension of time was granted since all the parties concerned had assumed and acted on the basis that the scheme was valid right from the start. Instead, certain parties would suffer prejudice if an extension was not granted. In view of this, coupled with the fact that the failure to comply with the condition precedent in question was technical and accidental, there was every reason to grant AGL an extension of time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to the case of <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Ray Brooks Pty Ltd</span></i> ([56] <i>supra</i>). Like the present appeal, <i>Ray Brooks Pty Ltd</i> was a case where a creditor (\u201cRay Brooks\u201d) had filed a (second, amended) proof of debt after the stipulated deadline for lodging proofs of debt. In that case, the administrator of an insolvent company (\u201cMr\u00a0Smith\u201d) had developed and proposed a scheme of arrangement as an alternative to liquidation, with a view to achieving a better return for the company\u2019s creditors than would be available in liquidation. The scheme was eventually approved by the court. Pursuant to the scheme, Ray Brooks lodged a proof of debt on 28\u00a0November 2001, which was before the stipulated deadline of 3\u00a0December 2001. Mr\u00a0Smith subsequently wrote to Ray Brooks on a few occasions requiring further particulars of its claim. To assist it in responding to Mr\u00a0Smith\u2019s queries, Ray Brooks engaged a consultancy firm, which sought (and was granted) an extension of time from Mr\u00a0Smith to provide the necessary particulars and supporting documents. The consultancy firm subsequently advised Ray Brooks that the claim originally submitted was significantly understated, and the latter thus submitted an amended proof of debt on 18\u00a0February 2002. Mr\u00a0Smith rejected this amended proof of debt on the basis that it had been submitted out of time, although the first proof of debt submitted was accepted as valid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In exercising the court\u2019s jurisdiction to extend the deadline for filing proofs of debt from 3\u00a0December 2001 to 18\u00a0February 2002 so as to admit Ray Brooks\u2019 amended proof of debt, Austin\u00a0J held at [91]\u2013[92]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>In my opinion, this is a case where considerations of fairness, in the exercise of its discretion under Pt\u00a040 r\u00a04 [of the Supreme Court Rules (NSW)], should lead the court to vary the time for Ray Brooks to lodge a formal proof of claim from 3\u00a0December 2001\u201318\u00a0February 2002</i>, so as to treat the second claim as the claim of Ray Brooks for the purposes of the scheme.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">In reaching this conclusion, I take specifically into account <i>the difficulties to which the company was subjected in preparing proof of its claim during the extremely busy grain harvesting period, and the propensity for error that this circumstance created</i>. I also take into account the <i>very large discrepancy between the first claim and the second claim</i>, reflecting a considered assessment by Ray Brooks that its entitlement was much higher than originally framed. I also take into account that, according to counsel for Ray Brooks, <i>his client does not seek to be able to rank for a distribution of a net amount greater than the amount of the first claim.

A common theme that runs through the cases discussed above (at [71]\u2013[78]) is that the party seeking an extension of time in each case was not <i>blameworthy</i> for its non-compliance with the original timeline \u2013 in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Caratti</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([54] <i>supra</i>), the creditors\u2019 solicitors had mislaid the documents in their office; in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([55] <i>supra</i>), Santow\u00a0J found that it was impossible in the first place for AGL to have complied with the condition precedent in question; and in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Ray Brooks Pty Ltd</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([56] <i>supra</i>), Ray Brooks had filed its first proof of debt in time and had a valid excuse for not providing the correct figure in that proof of debt (which had been prepared during the busy grain harvesting period), thus necessitating the filing of an amended proof of debt after the original deadline.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Besides prejudice, the conduct of the party seeking an extension of time (including its reasons for failing to comply with the original deadline) and, of course, the extent of the delay involved, it is difficult (or perhaps impossible) for us to list here all the other factors that may be relevant. Many of the other relevant factors would in any case be subsumed under the consideration of prejudice (see [79] above). What other factors are relevant will depend on the facts of each case, and it would always be important for a court considering an application for an extension of time to have regard to the entire factual matrix. However, we emphasise (and this point also emerges from the Australian cases discussed above) that the <i>overriding consideration</i> remains (and should remain) that of prejudice \u2013 <i>ie</i>, whether prejudice would be caused to any party bound by the scheme if the extension of time is or is not granted, and, if so, whether such prejudice can be redressed. Thus, a creditor who is late in filing its proof of debt due to a genuine oversight should not be penalised with forfeiture of its entire debt if no prejudice would be caused to the other creditors or the company by granting an extension of time. That is not to say, however, that a creditor can be as negligent or lackadaisical as it wants in filing its proof of debt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should not come as a surprise that prejudice and the conduct of the party seeking an extension of time are relevant considerations in the present context (<i>viz</i>, extension of a time frame contained in, specifically, a court-approved scheme), given that they are the same factors that a court considers when deciding whether to exercise its discretion to extend or abridge time pursuant to O\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court in other types of legal proceedings (see, generally, <i>Singapore Court Practice 2006</i> (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2006) at paras\u00a03/4/1\u20133/4/10 and <i>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</i> (G\u00a0P\u00a0Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at paras\u00a03/4/1\u20133/4/8). However, one difference, we would add, between an application for an extension of time in the context of a court-approved scheme and the same application in other contexts is that a court deciding whether to exercise its jurisdiction to extend time in the former should have regard to the</span> overarching need for clarity, certainty and finality, all of which are crucial for the proper functioning of schemes of arrangement. A court must therefore be circumspect when considering an application to extend time in the context of a court-approved scheme.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Whether an extension of time pursuant to the Rules of Court should be granted in the present case</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the court below, the Judge held that \u201ceven if there <span lang=\"EN-AU\">were jurisdiction to give an extension \u2026 the facts of this case did not merit the court\u2019s indulgence\u201d (see the GD at [42]). She noted that Oriental had been reminded on a number of occasions about the deadline for filing its proof of debt as well as the consequences of not filing one in time. More importantly, she held that</span> \u201ccontrary to Oriental\u2019s arguments that Reliance would suffer minimal prejudice if the present application was allowed \u2026 there would be <i>serious repercussions</i> if this application was allowed \u2026 for Reliance\u201d [emphasis added] (see the GD at [44]), and accepted Reliance\u2019s submission that \u201c<span lang=\"EN-AU\">the entire scheme might have to be <i>abandoned</i></span>\u201d [emphasis added] (<i>id</i>) if the application was allowed. Unfortunately, the Judge did not elaborate on what \u201cserious repercussions\u201d Reliance would suffer if Oriental\u2019s application for an extension of time were allowed or why the Scheme might have to be abandoned in that event. Indeed, this appeared to be nothing short of a bare submission by Reliance, unsupported by the facts before us. We therefore could not agree with the Judge that the facts of this case merited such a conclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We found, on the contrary, that no prejudice would be caused to Reliance or the other Scheme Creditors if we were to allow Oriental\u2019s application; in fact, Oriental would be severely prejudiced if we were to dismiss its application. Our reasons for coming to this conclusion are as follows.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, as mentioned earlier (see [8] above), the Scheme was a <i>solvent</i> one. Based on Reliance\u2019s audited accounts as at 31\u00a0December 2005, Reliance had sufficient assets to pay <i>all</i> the Scheme Creditors, including Oriental, <i>in full</i> (a point which counsel for Reliance acknowledged at the hearing before this court). In fact, it was clear from the Scheme Documents (see [7] above) that the purpose of the Scheme was to make <i>full payment</i> to all the Scheme Creditors so as to conclude the run-off of Reliance\u2019s business more expeditiously than would be the case if the run-off were to continue until all claims from Scheme Creditors had materialised and had been paid. It followed then that if an extension of time were granted to Oriental to file its proof of debt and its claim subsequently admitted, the rest of the Scheme Creditors would not in any way be prejudiced given that all of them would, in any event, be receiving full payment for their ascertained claims. Indeed, counsel for Reliance, upon being queried by us, conceded that Reliance had thus far not received any objection from any of the Scheme Creditors in respect of Oriental\u2019s application for an extension of time to file its proof of debt and for its claim to be admitted. The fact that the Scheme was a solvent one was an important factor (although by no means a decisive one) that we took into consideration in assessing if any prejudice would be caused to the rest of the Scheme Creditors or any other parties bound by the Scheme if Oriental\u2019s application were to be allowed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, at all material times, Oriental was a creditor <i>known</i> to Reliance, and Reliance was always prepared to meet Oriental\u2019s claim. Mr\u00a0Andy Campbell, a director of Reliance, had flown to India to garner Oriental\u2019s support for the Scheme, and Reliance had admitted Oriental\u2019s claim of approximately US$20m for the purposes of voting at the Court Meeting. It appeared from the Explanatory Statement that Oriental was (by virtue of the size of its claim) by far the largest creditor of Reliance, and if Oriental (voting by proxy at the Court Meeting) had not voted in favour of the Scheme, the Scheme might not have received the requisite approval of three-fourths in value of the Scheme Creditors present and voting either in person or by proxy at the Court Meeting as stipulated by s\u00a0210(3) of the Companies Act, and might in turn never have been implemented in the first place. In such circumstances, we could not see how Reliance would in any way be prejudiced if Oriental\u2019s claim were admitted as a result of our granting Oriental an extension of time to file its proof of debt. This was certainly not a case of a creditor suddenly materialising out of thin air.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thirdly, Oriental was only two months late in filing its proof of debt, and when Oriental first notified Reliance that it wished to file its proof of debt out of time in its letter dated 16\u00a0July 2007 (see [18] above), there was still a good six months before the targeted payment date of 28\u00a0February 2008 under the Scheme. Had Oriental\u2019s claim been admitted then (<i>ie</i>, in July 2007), the Scheme Manager would have had more than adequate time to ascertain Oriental\u2019s claim. Given also that no payment has been made under the Scheme thus far, we do not see how Reliance or any of the other Scheme Creditors would be prejudiced even if Oriental files its proof of debt now and has its claim admitted at this late stage. If anything, this would only mean that payment has to be deferred to a later date, but we note that the original <i>targeted</i> payment date was only a <i>tentative</i> date in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we were of the opinion that the only prejudice that could potentially arise in the present case would be that which would be caused to Oriental if its application for an extension of time were not granted. Oriental has a claim of <span lang=\"EN-AU\">US$19,031,656</span>, and, although this figure is an estimate, the ascertained claim would in any case still be a significant sum. This was what was at stake for Oriental in the present appeal, and if we had refused its application for an extension of time, we would, as contended by counsel for Oriental, literally be handing to the shareholder(s) of Reliance (WIG, in this case) an unmerited windfall. Oriental would be left with virtually nothing, although it had voted in favour of the Scheme and was all along a creditor known to Reliance to have an apparently genuine claim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This brings us to the question then of whether Oriental could only blame itself for not filing its proof of debt in time and whether it should be entitled to a second bite of the cherry. The Judge was clearly of the view that Oriental should not be given a second chance, given the numerous reminders that Reliance had purportedly sent out. We note that there was some dispute in the court below as to whether Oriental did receive those reminders. The Judge was of the view that since the letter of 14\u00a0November 2006 (see [14] above) had been sent to Oriental at the General Address (which was the address that the Scheme Documents had been sent to, and Oriental had confirmed receipt of those documents), and since at least three of the e-mails sent after November 2006 had been sent to the e-mail address provided by Oriental in its completed voting form, Reliance had done <span lang=\"EN-AU\">as much as it could to notify Oriental of the need to file its proof of debt before the Claims Cut-Off Date (see the GD at [42]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, we do not share the Judge\u2019s view that Reliance had done its best to notify Oriental of the deadline for filing its proof of debt. The crucial letter of 14\u00a0November 2006, which informed Oriental that the Scheme had been sanctioned by the High Court and which enclosed a proof of debt form as well as instructions for filing up the form, was addressed to Mr\u00a0Mohan, who had retired from Oriental in February 2005 (see [15] above). Although it was not wrong for Reliance to have sent this letter to the General Address, we would have thought that, as a matter of prudence and common sense, a copy of the letter, clearly addressed to Mr\u00a0Jindal (who had signed the voting form on behalf of Oriental), should also have been forwarded to the address provided in Oriental\u2019s completed voting form. As for the three e-mail reminders that were sent to Mr\u00a0Jindal\u2019s e-mail address (see [16] above), we note that although Reliance had produced \u201cDelivery Status Notification (Relay)\u201d reports to prove that those e-mails were indeed sent out, the reports did not in any way prove that Mr\u00a0Jindal had received the e-mails. We are also puzzled as to why Reliance only made two attempts (both unsuccessful) to contact Oriental by telephone and why those telephone calls were made to Oriental\u2019s fax number instead of Oriental\u2019s telephone number (see [17] above). Even if Reliance did not have Oriental\u2019s telephone number, it would have been able to obtain the number if it had genuinely resolved to do so.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nonetheless, we accept that Oriental was certainly not blameless (unlike the parties seeking an extension of time in the Australian cases discussed at [71]\u2013[78] above) for its failure to file its proof of debt in time. Even if Reliance had not informed Oriental that the Scheme had been sanctioned or had not reminded the latter about the deadline for filing its proof of debt, it would have been prudent for Oriental to make the necessary enquiries itself. However, as mentioned above (at [81]), the overriding consideration in determining whether the court\u2019s jurisdiction should be exercised in favour of granting an extension of time would be whether any prejudice will be caused to any party bound by the scheme if an extension of time were granted (or not granted), even though the court is also entitled to take into account, <i>inter alia</i>, the conduct of the party seeking an extension of time. The present case was not one of a patent oversight. Rather, there seemed to have been a slip between the cup and the lip on Oriental\u2019s part that ought to have been viewed with a measure of leniency. The facts we have referred to plainly show that no discernible prejudice would be caused to either the rest of the Scheme Creditors or Reliance if the present application for an extension of time were allowed; on the contrary, dismissing the application would have grave and irreparable consequences for Oriental. We are of the view that the failure by Oriental to file its proof of debt in time here was a case of inadvertent oversight on Oriental\u2019s part. Upon learning of its failure in this regard two months after the deadline for filing its proof of debt had passed, Oriental immediately wrote to notify Reliance of its wish to submit its claim, and, at that time, there was still approximately six months before the targeted payment date under the Scheme. Given these circumstances, we are of the view that the present case was one that warranted the exercise of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant an extension of time. Accordingly, we granted Oriental an extension of time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Whether the court has jurisdiction under section\u00a0392(4)(</em>d<em>) of the Companies Act to extend the time for filing proofs of debt</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of our reliance on O\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court to allow Oriental\u2019s appeal (and, thus, its application for an extension of time), it was not strictly necessary for us to consider the new (and alternative) legal argument raised by Oriental in its written skeletal submissions for this appeal (see [27] above), <i>viz</i>, that s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act conferred on the court jurisdiction (which was independent of the nature of schemes of arrangement) to grant an extension of time for a creditor in Oriental\u2019s position to file its proof of debt.

As there appears to be no equivalent provision in the UK\u2019s companies legislation, s\u00a0392 seems to have been derived entirely from Australian legislation. Presently, s\u00a0392 of the Companies Act is <i>in</i> <i>pari materia</i> with s\u00a01322 of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act, of which s\u00a01322(4)(d) (the subsection corresponding to s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act) reads as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subject to the following provisions of this section <i>but</i> without limiting the generality of any other provision of this Act, the Court may, on application by any interested person, make all or any of the following orders, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the Court imposes:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">\u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 an order extending the period for doing any act, matter or thing or instituting or taking any proceeding under this Act or in relation to a corporation (including an order extending a period where the period concerned ended before the application for the order was made) or abridging the period for doing such an act, matter or thing or instituting or taking such a proceeding \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Thus, save for the word \u201cbut\u201d (italicised in the quotation above) in the opening words of s\u00a01322(4)(d) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act, the wording of that provision is exactly the same as the wording of s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act.

It will be seen shortly that some of the cases discussed below concern legislation that predates the 2001 Australian Corporations Act. These cases are nonetheless relevant as they deal with essentially the same provision as the present s\u00a01322(4)(d) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act. Some brief comments on the background of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act are necessary to understand this (see, generally, <i>Ford</i> ([34] <i>supra</i>]), vol\u00a01 at paras\u00a02.170\u20132.320 (March 2002 release); <i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Australia</i> vol\u00a07 (J\u00a0D\u00a0Heydon gen ed) (Butterworths, Looseleaf Ed, 1993) at para\u00a0120-130 (March 2007 release); and Phillip Lipton &amp; Abe Herzberg, <i>Understanding Company Law</i> (Lawbook Co, 10th\u00a0Ed, 2001) at pp\u00a07\u20139). Companies legislation in Australia used to be under the purview of each state\u2019s legislature, but, in 1989, the Commonwealth parliament enacted the Corporations Act 1989 (Cth) (\u201cthe Commonwealth Corporations Act\u201d) as a national law governing companies. Although enacted in 1989, this Act did not take effect because of a successful constitutional challenge to it in <i>The State of New South Wales v The Commonwealth of Australia</i> (1990) 169\u00a0CLR 482, where the Australian High Court held that the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia did not confer power on the Commonwealth to make laws on the incorporation of companies generally. Pursuant to this decision, the Commonwealth, the various states and the Northern Territory, through co-ordinated legislation, sought to put in place a uniform companies law. The Commonwealth Corporations Act was amended such that it became the companies legislation of the Australian Capital Territory only, and s\u00a082 of that Act (as amended) set out what was termed \u201cthe Corporations Law\u201d. Instead of each state and the Northern Territory passing different statutes on companies law, each of them enacted as its companies legislation the Corporations Law set out in s\u00a082 of the Commonwealth Corporations Act (as amended) (\u201cthe Australian Corporations Law\u201d). This state of affairs continued until the 2001 Australian Corporations Act was enacted following a reference of power by the various states to the Commonwealth. Section\u00a01322(4)(d) of the Australian Corporations Law is, in fact, equivalent to s\u00a01322(4)(d) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act (the same applies in respect of s\u00a01322(6)(c) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act). Many Australian textbooks, when referring to s\u00a01322(4)(d), do not state whether they are referring to this provision as it is set out in the 2001 Australian Corporations Act or as it is set out in the Australian Corporations Law. References to s\u00a01322(4)(d) in cases dealing with legislation predating before the 2001 Australian Corporations Act are, in fact, references to s\u00a01322(4)(d) of the Australian Corporations Law, and we shall use the generic term \u201cs\u00a01322(4)(d)\u201d in these grounds of decision to denote this subsection regardless of the particular piece of Australian legislation which it appears in . With this in mind, we proceed now to consider some of these cases.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Australia, s\u00a01322(4)(d) has been applied in a number of instances where the time for doing a certain act was prescribed by the Australian Corporations Law and/or the 2001 Australian Corporations Act (see, for instance, <i>Village Roadshow Broadcasting Pty Ltd v Austereo Ltd</i> (1997) 24\u00a0ACSR 185, where Goldberg\u00a0J used s\u00a01322(4)(d) to abridge the period during which dissenting offerees to a takeover offer could apply under s\u00a0701(6) of the Australian Corporations Law in respect of notices given to them by the offeror, and <i>National Roads and Motorists\u2019 Association Ltd v Parkin</i> (2004) 49\u00a0ACSR 485, where Campbell\u00a0J used s\u00a01322(4)(d) to extend by two months the time for the applicant company to hold a general meeting pursuant to a requisition from its members under s\u00a0249D of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act; see also, generally,</span> <i>Ford</i> ([34] <i>supra</i>), vol\u00a01 <span lang=\"EN-AU\">at para\u00a07.583 (November 2005 release)). The Australian courts have, however, also held that s\u00a01322(4)(d) does not apply in some instances (see, for example, <i>Re Panbio Pty Ltd</i> (2000) 35\u00a0ACSR 458, where it was held that s\u00a01322(4)(d) could not be used to extend or abridge the one-month period specified in s\u00a0164 of the Australian Corporations Law for a company which had changed its company type to alter the details of its registration as to invoke s\u00a01322(4)(d) in this manner would undermine the protection provided in s\u00a0164(7) of the Australian Corporations Law; and <i>S\u00a0T\u00a0(2) Pty Ltd v Lockwood</i> (1998) 27\u00a0ACSR 667, where it was held that s\u00a01322(4)(d) did not apply to cure a failure to comply with s\u00a0444B(2)(a) of the Australian Corporations Law, which required a company to execute a deed of company arrangement within 21 days after the end of the creditors\u2019 meeting at which it was resolved that the company should execute such a deed, as s\u00a0444B(2) already contained within it a specific remedial provision (<i>viz</i>, s\u00a0444B(2)(b)) in the event that an extension of time was needed). It appears that in instances where a specific time period is prescribed by the 2001 Australian Corporations Act and/or the Australian Corporations Law, whether s\u00a01322(4)(d) can operate to extend that time period will depend upon the particular statutory context (<i>Brown v DML Resources Pty Ltd (No\u00a06)</i> (2002) 40\u00a0ACSR 669). Section\u00a01322(4)(d) has also been applied in instances where the time period was not directly fixed by statute, such as in <i>Re Dana Australia (Holdings) Pty Ltd</i> (2006) 57\u00a0ACSR 99, where Finkelstein\u00a0J held that the subsection permitted the court to extend the time for doing certain acts fixed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in class orders made under s\u00a0341 of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the applicability of s\u00a01322(4)(d) to the extension of time <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> schemes of arrangement, this was considered by Santow\u00a0J in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([55] <i>supra</i>). He opined at [51]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span class=\"Judg-quote-1Char\">Although it is not necessary finally to decide whether s\u00a01322(4)(d) applies in these circumstances, and especially with no contradictor, clearly <i>s\u00a01322(4)(d) was drawn in very wide terms as a remedial provision</i>. Moreover, the words \u201cin relation to\u201d are well recognised as words of expansive meaning (see, eg, <i>Tooheys Ltd v Cmr of Stamp Duties</i> (1961) 105\u00a0CLR 602) but gathering its meaning \u201cfrom the context in which it appears ... which will determine the matters to which it extends\u201d: per Deane, Dawson and Toohey\u00a0JJ in <i>Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (Qld) v Technical Products Pty Ltd</i> (1988) 165\u00a0CLR 642 at 653; 81\u00a0ALR 260. It allows the court to make an order extending or abridging time whether for any proceeding under the [Australian Corporations] Law or \u201crelating to a corporation\u201d. <i>A scheme of arrangement clearly \u201crelates to a corporation\u201d being the corporation which proposed the scheme.</i> [emphasis added</span>]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since Santow\u00a0J had already decided that the court could grant AGL the extension of time sought pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules (NSW) (on the basis that a scheme of arrangement derived its efficacy from the order of court approving the scheme), his comments above were strictly <i>obiter</i>. We note that Santow\u00a0J himself prefaced the above passage with the caveat that \u201cit [was] not necessary finally to decide whether s\u00a01322(4)(d) [applied] in these circumstances\u201d, and he made it clear again later in his judgment (at [53]) that he was not deciding if the subsection would apply in the case before him:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The plaintiff [AGL] submits that in the circumstances of this case the operation of the section [<i>ie</i>, s\u00a01322(4)(d)] is enlivened and that as a matter of discretion I could make appropriate orders. If I had not been minded to make orders on the bases set out above, I would have needed to reach a conclusion on that; but <i>I do not need to do so and prefer to leave that question for another day</i>. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for Reliance submitted that <span lang=\"EN-AU\">s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act would not be of avail to Oriental in the present case as it has been held in <i>Diversified Mineral Resources NL v Amusmet Investments Pty Ltd</i> (1991) 24\u00a0NSWLR 77 (\u201c<i>Diversified Mineral Resources</i>\u201d) that the corresponding Australian provision (<i>ie</i>, s\u00a01322(4)(d)) did not apply in a situation where an event occurred automatically upon the termination of a prescribed time frame, as opposed to a case where some act must be undertaken in order for the event in question to occur within the stipulated time frame</span>. <span lang=\"EN-AU\">Reliance contended that Oriental\u2019s claim:</span><a id=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">[note: 7]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\u2026 was, pursuant to the Scheme, deemed zero automatically when it failed to submit its Proof of Debt on time; no further action was required on the part of [Reliance]. Thus, Section\u00a0392(4)(d) of the [Companies] Act cannot avail [Oriental].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">At the hearing before this court, counsel for Reliance pointed out, in support of the above submission, that Santow\u00a0J himself in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">at [51] had observed that <i>Diversified Mineral Resources</i> was authority for the proposition that s\u00a01322(4)(d) did not apply where time expired automatically.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, we do not agree with Reliance\u2019s submission. In relation to Santow\u00a0J\u2019s observation, the relevant part of his judgment in <i>Re AGL</i> <i>Gas Networks</i> at [51] reads as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[T]here is authority for the proposition that where time expires automatically, for example under the [Australian Corporations] Law or the [company\u2019s] articles \u2013 and it might be suggested a scheme condition \u2013 s\u00a01322(4)(d) cannot be used to extend it: <i>Diversified Mineral Resources NL v Amusmet Investments Pty Ltd</i> (1991) 5\u00a0ACSR 465; 9\u00a0ACLC 1047 per McLelland\u00a0J. <i>Dicta by the High Court may suggest that that constraint does not apply at least where the step is one directly for the corporation or its creditors to take, rather than one which less directly merely</i> <i>concerns</i> <i>the corporation</i>: <i>Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien</i> (2000) 172\u00a0ALR 28; 34\u00a0ACSR 250 at 260. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">From the above passage, it appears that Santow\u00a0J was of the view that <i>Diversified Mineral Resources</i> represented the proposition that if a stipulated time period for doing an act expired automatically under the Australian Corporations Law or the articles of association of a company, s\u00a01322(4)(d) could not be used to extend that time period. However, he qualified his view by commenting that that constraint did not appear to apply at least where the step to be taken within the stipulated time period was one <i>directly</i> for the corporation or its creditors to take. As discussed earlier (see [73]\u2013[75] above), in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, an extension of time was sought for AGL to fulfil a condition precedent laid down in the scheme, namely, an amendment of its then existing authorisation under the NSW Gas Act before midnight on 30\u00a0June 1994. Santow\u00a0J noted that such an amendment was not exactly \u201ca step directly relating to a corporate proceeding though indispensable to it taking effect\u201d (</span><i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">id</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">at [51]). However, as he had already decided that the court could extend time pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), he felt that there was no need to decide if s\u00a01322(4)(d) applied on the facts (see [99]\u2013[100] above). Unlike the factual scenario in <i>Re AGL Gas Networks</i>, the present appeal concerns the filing of a proof of debt by a company\u2019s creditor (<i>ie</i>, Oriental) under a court-approved scheme (<i>ie</i>, the Scheme). Unlike the fulfilment of the particular condition precedent which was considered in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">, the filing of a proof of debt, on Santow\u00a0J\u2019s own view that</span> a scheme of arrangement \u201cclearly \u2018relate[d] to a corporation\u2019 being the corporation which proposed the scheme\u201d (<i>id</i> at [51]) and \u201cso too [did] performance of all the scheme steps\u201d (<i>ibid</i>), <span lang=\"EN-AU\">is clearly a step directly \u201cin relation to a corporation\u201d for the purposes of s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act</span>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The present case is also distinguishable from <i>Diversified Mineral Resources</i> on two points. Firstly, the latter case involved a statutory provision, <i>ie</i>, s\u00a0388(1) of the Australian Corporations Law, which prescribed a 14-day time period for a shareholder to pay up upon a demand for payment pursuant to a call by the company on that shareholder\u2019s shares, failing which the shareholder\u2019s shares would be automatically forfeited for non-payment. Thus, unlike the scenario in this appeal, <i>Diversified Mineral Resources</i>, to begin with, was not concerned with a situation where the time period in question was not prescribed by statute.</span> Secondly, <span lang=\"EN-AU\">in <i>Diversified Mineral Resources</i>, the interlocutory application brought by the defendant shareholder was for an extension of the time period set out in s\u00a0388(1) of the Australian Corporations Law, upon the expiry of which a shareholder\u2019s shares could be automatically forfeited for non-payment pursuant to a call made on those shares. McLelland\u00a0J held (<i>inter alia</i>) at 78 that s\u00a01322(4)(d) did not apply because under s\u00a01322(4)(d), the relevant power conferred on the court was to extend the period \u201cfor <i>doing</i> any act, matter or thing or instituting or taking any proceeding under this Law or in relation to a corporation\u201d [emphasis added]; since forfeiture for non-payment upon a call on shares occurred automatically under s\u00a0388(1) without occasion for anyone to do any act, matter or thing or institute or take any proceeding in order for forfeiture to occur, s\u00a01322(4)(d) was inapplicable. This appeared to be the holding relied on by Reliance (see [101] above) in its submission that s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act was similarly of no avail to Oriental in this appeal. With respect, Reliance has misapplied McLelland\u00a0J\u2019s holding in <i>Diversified Mineral Resources</i>. In that case, the time period in question related to the <i>forfeiture</i> of shares; the defendant shareholder was seeking to delay forfeiture by obtaining an extension of the time period set out in s\u00a0388(1) of the Australian Corporations Law pending the hearing of the substantive proceedings as to whether there was in fact any money owing on its shares. In contrast, the relevant time period in this appeal related to the <i>filing</i> of a proof of debt, and not the <i>deeming</i> of a Scheme Creditor\u2019s claim to be zero if its proof of debt was not filed by the Claims Cut-Off Date. The filing of a proof of debt would certainly be an act \u201cin relation to a corporation\u201d within the meaning of s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act if Santow\u00a0J\u2019s reasoning in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Re AGL Gas Networks</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">at [51] (see the passage cited at [99] above) is accepted. It can, perhaps, plausibly be said that in <i>Diversified Mineral Resources</i>, the defendant shareholder was effectively seeking an extension of time to make payment following the company\u2019s call on its shares, and although such payment would certainly have been an act in relation to a corporation, the court held that s\u00a01322(4)(d) did not apply. However, this was not how the application for extension of time was framed before McLelland\u00a0J (perhaps, if the application in that case had indeed been framed in that way, McLelland\u00a0J might have allowed it, but we need say no further on this). In any event, as mentioned at [98] above, whether s\u00a01322(4)(d) can be applied to extend a time limit prescribed by a provision in the Australian Corporations Law and/or the 2001 Australian Corporations Act would invariably depend on the particular statutory context. No such consideration arises where the time period which is sought to be extended is <i>not</i> prescribed by statute, such as in the present appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the plain wording of s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act, we are of the view that there is no reason why this subsection cannot, in principle, apply to any step to be taken by a creditor under a court-approved scheme, such as the filing of a proof of debt in this case, subject to the caveat that no order under s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) can be made unless the court is satisfied that no substantial injustice would be caused to any party by the making of such an order (see s\u00a0392(6)(<i>c</i>)).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>\u201cSubstantial injustice\u201d for the purposes of section\u00a0392(6)(</em>c<em>)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It remains to be seen what the meaning of \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d in s\u00a0392(6)(<i>c</i>) of the Companies Act is. The learned authors of <i>Ford</i> ([34] <i>supra</i>) explained the requirement of \u201cno substantial injustice\u201d in the corresponding Australian provision (<i>ie</i>, s\u00a01322(6)(c) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act) as follows (at vol\u00a01, para\u00a07.584 (November 2005 release)):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Section\u00a01322(6)(c) prescribes a condition which affects all four kinds of order [which can be made under s\u00a01322]. <i>The court must be satisfied that no substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any person</i>. As it appeared in s\u00a0366 of the Uniform Companies Act 1961 (Cth), this condition was considered in <i>Re Compaction Systems Pty Ltd</i> <nobr>[1976] 2 NSWLR 477</nobr>; (1976) 2\u00a0ACLR 135; (1977\u201378) CLC\u00a040-313. Bowen\u00a0CJ in Eq said (ACLR at 150):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><i>In my view, the word \u201cinjustice\u201d in this provision requires the court to consider any real, and not merely insubstantial or theoretical, prejudice which will be suffered by, for example, a member by the making of an order, and to weigh this in the scales against the prejudice to the company, other members and creditors, if an order is not made</i>. In other words, it is insufficient to show that there may be some prejudice to a member if, on a consideration of the whole matter, the overwhelming weight of justice, as it were, is in favour of making the order (see <i>Re Australian Continental Resources Ltd</i> (1975) 10\u00a0ACTR 19; 1\u00a0ACLR 405 per Blackburn\u00a0J at 33\u20134; see also <i>Re Castlereagh Securities Ltd</i> <nobr>[1973] 1 NSWLR 624</nobr>; (1971\u201373) CLC\u00a040\u2013066 and <i>Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd v ASC</i> (1993) 11\u00a0ACSR 157 at 160; 11\u00a0ACLC 787).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Essentially, Bowen\u00a0CJ held in <i>Re Compaction System Pty Ltd</i> <nobr>[1976] 2 NSWLR 77</nobr> that it was necessary to show <i>real</i> rather than <i>insubstantial</i> or <i>theoretical</i> prejudice in order to dissuade the court from making an order under the then equivalent of s\u00a01322(4) of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act. The prejudice against a particular party if an order were made must be weighed against the prejudice to the other members and creditors of the company as well as to the company itself if the order were not made, and thus, a decision as to whether substantial injustice exists is \u201ca <i>balancing act</i>\u201d [emphasis added] (see <i>Australian Corporation Law</i> ([39] <i>supra</i>), at vol\u00a03, para\u00a09.4.0080 (April 2007 release)). Bowen\u00a0CJ\u2019s observations as set out above have been approvingly referred to locally in <i>Golden Harvest Films Distribution (Pte) Ltd v Golden Village Multiplex Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 940</nobr> at [54], where this court suggested that the determination of substantial injustice under s\u00a0392 of the Companies Act involved \u201ca holistic weighing and balancing of the various interests of all the relevant parties\u201d.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our opinion, the <i>same</i> balancing act is undertaken by the court when it considers the potential prejudice that may be caused to the interested parties if it were to exercise or decline to exercise its jurisdiction to extend time under O\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court (see [79] and [81] above). A question that then arises is whether the test of \u201cno substantial injustice\u201d in s\u00a0392(6)(<i>c</i>) of the Companies Act entails a consideration of the same factors as those relating to prejudice which the court takes into account in determining whether an extension of time should be granted under the Rules of Court. We agree with Bowen\u00a0CJ\u2019s observation in <i>Re Compaction Systems Pty Ltd</i> (see the passage quoted at [105] above) that \u201cinjustice\u201d in s\u00a0392(6)(<i>c</i>) refers to the same thing as (real) prejudice. As for the word \u201csubstantial\u201d, it is defined in A\u00a0S\u00a0Hornby, <i>Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English</i> (Oxford University Press, 5th\u00a0Ed, 1995) at p\u00a01192 as \u201clarge in amount or value; considerable\u201d. In our opinion, the court can grant an extension of time under s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act so long as it is satisfied that no <i>considerable</i> prejudice would be caused to any of the interested parties if the order is made. It thus appears to us that \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d in s\u00a0392(6)(<i>c</i>) amounts to something greater than just ordinary prejudice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we would stop short of saying that a party who fails to obtain an extension of time under the Rules of Court can, in contrast, do so under s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act if, say, it is shown that some prejudice may be caused to a relevant party, but the prejudice does not amount to \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d. It must be borne in mind that the power conferred on the court by s\u00a0392(4) is <i>discretionary</i>, given that the provision directs that the court \u201c<i>may</i>, on application by any interested person, make all or any of the following orders [in ss\u00a0392(4)(<i>a</i>)\u2013392(4)(<i>d</i>)], either unconditionally or <i>subject to such conditions as the Court imposes</i>\u201d [emphasis added] (see [93] above). Thus, the learned editors of <i>The Laws of Australia</i> vol\u00a04 (Thomson Lawbook Co, Looseleaf Ed, 1993) have, in regard to the making of orders under s\u00a01322 of the 2001 Australian Corporations Act, commented as follows (at para\u00a04.2.1320 (April 2006 release)):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Even where the court is satisfied of the matters specified in s\u00a01322(6) [<i>ie</i>, that no substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any party], it retains a <i>discretion</i> whether or not to make a validating order, and does not do so unless it considers intervention to be justified. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It follows that notwithstanding that the court is satisfied that no substantial injustice would be caused to any party if an order is made under s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act, the court can decline to make the order, having regard to the entire circumstances of the case. In our opinion, the same considerations that a court takes into account in deciding if an extension of time should be granted under the Rules of Court (as summarised at [79]\u2013[81] above) should equally apply for the purposes of deciding if an extension of time should be granted under s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act. This would mean that the court in the latter situation could, besides prejudice, also take into consideration, <i>inter alia</i>, the reason(s) why the party seeking an extension of time failed to comply with the timeline originally stipulated. It would be anomalous if an extension of time can be granted to a creditor to file its proof of debt under the Rules of Court, but not under s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act, or <i>vice versa</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Whether section\u00a0392(4)(</em>d<em>) was of avail to Oriental in the present case</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have already given our reasons as to why we would exercise our jurisdiction pursuant to the Rules of Court to grant Oriental an extension of time to file its proof of debt in the present case (see [85]\u2013[91] above). For the same reasons, we would have been prepared to grant Oriental an extension of time pursuant to s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Companies Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, since granting Oriental an extension of time pursuant to the Rules of Court to file its proof of debt would not cause any prejudice to either the rest of the Scheme Creditors or Reliance, we do not see how these parties would suffer any \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d within the meaning of s\u00a0392(6)(<i>c</i>) of the Companies Act if we were to allow, in the alternative, the extension of time under s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) of that Act. We therefore held that s\u00a0392(4)(<i>d</i>) would be of avail to Oriental in the present case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Considering para\u00a01.7 of the Explanatory Statement and cl\u00a02.1 of the Scheme of Compromise and Arrangement (see [7] above), it was clear beyond peradventure that the unmistakeable objective of the Scheme was to ensure accelerated <i>full payment</i> to all the Scheme Creditors. Given the fact that Reliance had <i>prima facie</i> not only acknowledged Oriental as a legitimate creditor, but had also sought as well as obtained the latter\u2019s support as a majority creditor, was it not plainly consistent with the Scheme\u2019s declared intent and purport to grant Oriental an extension of time to file its proof of debt so that its claim could be processed? Reliance\u2019s stance in relying on a barren procedural obstacle (namely, Oriental\u2019s failure to file its proof of debt by the Claims Cut-Off Date), which would not in the overall scheme of things prejudice the implementation of the Scheme, to reject (effectively) Oriental\u2019s claim was unmeritorious, to say the least. In the result, we allowed Oriental\u2019s appeal with costs here, but not below (we ordered each party to bear its own costs of the proceedings in the court below), and granted Oriental an extension of time until 5.00pm on 22\u00a0January 2008 to file its proof of debt.</p>\n\n<div><br clear=\"all\"/>\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 1]</span></span></a> See para\u00a020 of Reliance\u2019s written submissions filed on 11\u00a0October 2007 for the hearing of Oriental\u2019s application for an extension of time to file its proof of debt.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 2]</span></span></a> See para\u00a09 of Oriental\u2019s skeletal arguments filed on 2\u00a0January 2008 for this appeal.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn3\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 3]</span></span></a> See p\u00a010 of Reliance\u2019s skeletal arguments filed on 10\u00a0January 2008 for this appeal.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn4\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 4]</span></span></a> See para\u00a049 of Reliance\u2019s written case filed on 27\u00a0December 2007 for this appeal.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn5\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 5]</span></span></a> See paras\u00a027\u201328 of Oriental\u2019s skeletal arguments filed on 2\u00a0January 2008 for this appeal.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn6\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn6\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 6]</span></span></a> See n\u00a04, <i>supra</i>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn7\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn7\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref7\" name=\"_ftn7\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 7]</span></span></a> See para\u00a059 of Reliance\u2019s skeletal arguments filed on 10\u00a0January 2008 for this appeal.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Each investment-linked policy offered by the appellant (referred to hereafter in the singular as \u201cILP\u201d and in the plural as \u201cILPs\u201d) provided a cover on the life of the insured and allowed the policyholder to invest the premiums in the appellant\u2019s investment funds. The appellant was at all material times the trustee of all the units in its investment funds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"/>2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The respondents in this appeal were policyholders/investors in the ILPs. A dispute arose between the respondents and the appellant around June 2008 concerning the ILPs, culminating in the filing of a suit (\u201cthe Suit\u201d) by the appellant, in its own capacity as well as in its capacity as trustee for other policyholders, against the respondents. After the filing of the Suit, the respondents\u2019 investments in the ILPs were liquidated and the proceeds (\u201cthe Stake\u201d) were held in a joint stakeholder\u2019s account pending the resolution of the Suit. The respondents subsequently requested for the release of certain sums of moneys from that account but the appellant refused to accede to the request.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"/>3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response, the respondents brought an application for interim payment of certain sums of money (\u201cthe Application\u201d). This appeal arose from the decision of the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) on the Application. In his decision, the Judge ordered an interim payment of $1,019,300 to the respondents (see <em>American International Assurance Co Ltd v Wong Cherng Yaw</em> <nobr>[2009] SGHC 89</nobr> (\u201cthe GD\u201d)). Before proceeding further, it would be apposite to summarise the salient facts of this dispute.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background facts</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"/>4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first and second respondents were agents of the appellant and sold ILPs to the third to tenth respondents. The sixth to tenth respondents subsequently assigned their ILPs to the first to fifth respondents. The respondents collectively invested a total of $1,059,300 under 21 ILPs with the appellant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"/>5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under each of the ILPs, premiums paid by the policyholder were used to invest in units in funds listed in a \u201cSchedule of Funds\u201d annexed to each of the contracts. The funds listed differed between different ILPs. The number of units in a fund which a policyholder could purchase with any given sum under an ILP depended on the price at which the units were to be issued. When a policyholder liquidated his or her units in the fund, the proceeds due to the policyholder were determined by the price at which the units were to be redeemed. Under the ILPs, policyholders were also entitled to switch between funds as many times as they wanted, chargeable at $25 for every switch after the first four switches which were free. These fund switches were done by the policyholders submitting a formal request to the appellant. The policyholder\u2019s right to switch funds was set out in each of the ILPs as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"center\"><b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FUND SWITCH</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[The policyholder] may, from time to time, instruct [the appellant] to switch all or any of the Units of a Fund via a Fund Switch in writing in such manner and subject to such conditions as [the appellant] may from time to time impose. [The appellant] reserve[s] the right to revise at any time in [its] discretion any minimum fund switch amount imposed and to terminate or suspend this Fund Switch facility. [The appellant] shall not be responsible for any losses arising from or attributable to [its] decision to terminate or suspend this facility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">...</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[The policyholder has] 4 free switches per policy year, and the switches thereafter shall be subject to a Fund Switch Fee of S$25 per switch payable by [the policyholder] through the cancellation of Units.

Any unused free switches will be forfeited at the end of the policy year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"/>6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through numerous fund switches over the course of two years from July 2006 to August 2008, the respondents were able to make large profits. Their investments peaked on 7\u00a0August 2008 with the ILPs valued at a total of $18,759,523.27, giving the respondents a paper gain of $17,700,223.27, representing a 1,671% rate of return.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"/>7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the third respondent, Mr\u00a0Lim Wee Chee, in his affidavit filed on 13\u00a0October 2008 on behalf of the other respondents, he purchased his first ILP effective from 24\u00a0March 2006 and incurred losses within the first few months. He started analysing the fund movements and their underlying markets. By keeping up with the trends of fund prices, he was able to take calculated risks by switching from one fund to another to avoid adverse fluctuations in prices and to ride on positive trends. He alone made more than 300 fund switches over the span of two years. The other respondents also made similar fund switches in reliance on his decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"/>8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 8\u00a0August 2008, the third respondent applied to withdraw $495,420 from one of his ILPs. The appellant refused to allow the withdrawal. Attempts by the third respondent and other respondents subsequently to partially withdraw or surrender their ILPs were similarly unsuccessful. Furthermore, the respondents\u2019 applications made from 25\u00a0August 2008 to 29\u00a0August 2008 to switch funds were rejected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"/>9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, the third respondent\u2019s solicitors wrote to the appellant on 3\u00a0September 2008 demanding payment of the partial withdrawal that the third respondent had sought. After an exchange of correspondence, the appellant commenced the Suit. The basis of the Suit, that emerged later, was that the appellant had made a mistake in valuing the funds by using one-day-old bid prices (unit prices) to effect the fund switches and this resulted in the respondents being given a larger share of the units or liquidated proceeds than what they should have been entitled to, at the expense of other policyholders. In support of the appellant\u2019s case, Mr\u00a0Martin Knight (\u201cMr\u00a0Knight\u201d), the appellant\u2019s vice-president of the Actuary Department, filed an affidavit on 21\u00a0November 2008, in which he explained the mistake and how it led to the respondents making enormous gains artificially from the switches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"/>10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appellant claims that the respondents had knowingly exploited the mistake <em>vis-\u00e0-vis</em> the bid prices. The appellant investigated the respondents\u2019 fund switching activities between March 2008 and May 2008 but the appellant\u2019s case is that it did not discover its mistake at that time. According to Mr\u00a0Knight\u2019s affidavit, the appellant only realised its mistake in late July 2008 when it looked into the large amounts being switched and the excessively high returns recorded under the respondents\u2019 ILPs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a id=\"Ftn_1_1\" href=\"#Ftn_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"/>11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its written submissions before the Judge, the appellant contended as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"/>(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the appellant had made a mistake in valuing the relevant funds by using one-day-old bid prices in determining the bid prices for the fund switches and that the respondents had been unjustly enriched by exploiting the appellant\u2019s mistake in determining the bid prices for the fund switches;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"/>(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the respondents had exploited the appellant\u2019s mistake, and thereby knowingly caused a loss of about $11,040,000 to the other policyholders;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"/>(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the respondents were liable as constructive trustees for the loss and damage caused to the other policyholders;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_d\"/>(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the respondents were liable to the appellant for damages for tortious conspiracy;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_e\"/>(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the first and second respondents were in breach of their fiduciary duties and contracts to the appellant in their capacity as agents of the appellant;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f\"/>(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the appellant was entitled to an account and an inquiry to trace and recover the units and/or the proceeds on liquidating the units;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g\"/>(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the appellant was entitled to recover the sums of $239,945.50 and $189,490.93 previously paid out to the second and fourth respondents respectively; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_h\"/>(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the appellant was entitled to an indemnity from the respondents for any liability that the appellant might incur to the other policyholders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"/>12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the Suit was filed on 9\u00a0September 2008, the respondents agreed with the appellant on 22\u00a0October 2008 to liquidate their positions in the ILPs they held on a \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d basis. As a result, the proceeds of liquidation amounting to $10,323,621.71, <em>ie</em>, the Stake, were put in a joint stakeholder\u2019s account pending the disposal of the Suit.

Instead, he invoked the court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction, and, in the alternative, O\u00a029 r\u00a02(4). We can immediately dismiss as irrelevant O\u00a029 r\u00a02 (which relates to the detention, custody or preservation of any property which is the subject matter of a cause or matter) since the parties have already placed the liquidated proceeds with a stakeholder on a \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d basis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>Order\u00a029 rule\u00a012(<em>c</em>)</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"/>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite counsel for the respondents\u2019 decision not to ground his submissions on O\u00a029 r\u00a011 or r\u00a012 of the Rules, the Judge considered the Application under O\u00a029 r\u00a012(<em>c</em>) and made an order for interim payment, which is the subject matter of this appeal. Order\u00a029 r\u00a012 provides as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>Order for interim payment in respect of sums other than damages (O. 29, r. 12)</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>12</b>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, on the hearing of an application under Rule 10, the Court is satisfied \u2014</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>a</em>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the plaintiff has obtained an order for an account to be taken as between himself and the defendant and for any amount certified due on taking the account to be paid;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>b</em>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the plaintiff\u2019s action includes a claim for possession of land and, if the action proceeded to trial, the defendant would be held liable to pay to the plaintiff a sum of money in respect of the defendant\u2019s use and occupation of the land during the pendency of the action, even if a final judgment or order were given or made in favour of the defendant; or</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>c</em>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that, <em>if the action proceeded to trial, the plaintiff would obtain judgment against the defendant for a substantial sum of money apart from any damages or costs</em>,</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">the Court may, if it thinks fit, and without prejudice to any contentions of the parties as to the nature or character of the sum to be paid by the defendant, order the defendant to make an interim payment of such amount as it thinks just, after taking into account any set-off, cross-claim or counterclaim on which the defendant may be entitled to rely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The Judge\u2019s application of Order\u00a029 rule\u00a012(<em>c</em>)</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"/>16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With reference to the judgment of Neill\u00a0LJ in <em>Schott Kem Ltd v Bentley</em> [1991] 1\u00a0QB 61 (\u201c<em>Schott Kem</em>\u201d), the Judge applied a two-stage test to determine whether to order an interim payment under O\u00a029 r\u00a012(<em>c</em>) of the Rules. Having regard to the evidence before him, he was satisfied that the respondents would obtain judgment for a substantial sum, after taking into account the claims of the appellant. He then decided that he was justified in exercising his discretion to order interim payment of $1,019,300 to the respondents. In the course of reaching his decision, the Judge also commented on the English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Shanning International Ltd v George Wimpey International Ltd</em> [1989] 1\u00a0WLR 981 (\u201c<em>Shanning</em>\u201d). The Judge read <em>Shanning</em> as having decided that any independent counterclaim was <em>also</em> a relevant consideration at the <em>first</em> stage (see the GD at <a href=\"#p1_23\">[23]</a>), and expressed his dissent from such approach. He took the view that, in an application under O\u00a029 r\u00a012(<em>c</em>), the court should consider, under the first stage, any defences and counterclaims which qualify as set-offs, but not <em>all</em> counterclaims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"/>17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, it may well have been unnecessary for the Judge to have disagreed with <em>Shanning</em>. In <em>Civil Procedure 2009</em>, vol\u00a02 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2009) (\u201cthe English White Book\u201d), the authors explained the effect of <em>Shanning</em> in this manner (at para\u00a015-103):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The application should be considered by the court in two stages (<em>Schott Kem Ltd v Bentley</em> [1991] 1\u00a0Q.B. 61; [1990] 3 All E.R. 850, CA). The court must first be satisfied that, if the action proceeds to trial, the claimant will obtain judgment for a substantial sum, and, if so, the court should then consider whether, in its discretion, it should order an interim payment. At the first stage the claimant must satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities, but to a high standard, that he will obtain judgment for a substantial sum; <em>the likelihood of a set-off or any other defence succeeding must be considered by the court</em>. At the second stage the rules also require \u2026 the court to take into account any set-off claimed by the defendant, <em>and any counterclaim arising out of some other transaction and not available as a defence</em> (<em>Shanning International Ltd v George Wimpey International Ltd</em> [1988] [<em>sic</em>] 1\u00a0W.L.R. 981; [1988] 3\u00a0All E.R. 475, CA). [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"/>18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The authors of the English White Book do not appear to read <em>Shanning</em> to hold that independent counterclaims should be considered by the court at the first stage. However, the authors of <em>Commercial Litigation: Pre-Emptive Remedies</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th\u00a0Ed, 2002, Looseleaf, Release\u00a09, April 2007) (Iain S\u00a0Goldrein\u00a0QC ed) hold a contrary view (see para\u00a0A6-185). There is also another English Court of Appeal decision, namely, <em>Smallman Construction Ltd v Redpath Dorman Long Ltd</em> (1988) 47\u00a0BLR 15, which expressed the view that independent counterclaims must be considered by the court at both the <em>first</em> stage and second stage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"/>19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not necessary for this court to decide what the true position under our O\u00a029 r\u00a012(<em>c</em>) is at present.

The Judge held that they were, because even after taking into account the appellant\u2019s cross-claims against the respondents\u2019 claims, there would still be a substantial sum left from the Stake representing the capital of their investments in the ILPs (their \u201ccapital investment\u201d). The respondents were entitled to recover their capital unless the appellant could show that it had a genuine claim on those moneys. As the appellant\u2019s claim was effectively based on the respondents\u2019 alleged unjust enrichment, the claim, even if successful, would not have an impact on the respondents\u2019 claim to the return of their capital investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"/>21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before us, the appellant argued that the Judge erred in his reasoning as the respondents\u2019 investments in the ILPs were not capital guaranteed. Counsel for the appellant also submitted that the amounts prayed for in the appellant\u2019s cross-claims could exceed the Stake. He referred to the affidavit filed on 21\u00a0November 2008 of Mr\u00a0Knight, who had estimated the loss suffered by the other policyholders (as a result of the dilution of their positions due to the respondents\u2019 fund switches) to be about $11m.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a id=\"Ftn_2_1\" href=\"#Ftn_2\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"/>22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Counsel also contended that the interim payment procedure in O\u00a029 r\u00a012 of the Rules was not appropriate where the factual issues were complicated or where difficult points of law arose, as in the present case (see the English White Book (<a href=\"#p1_17\">[17]</a> <em>supra</em>) at para\u00a015-95 citing <em>Schott Kem</em> (<a href=\"#p1_16\">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>), <em>Chiron Corporation v Murex Diagnostics Limited (No\u00a013)</em> (1996) 23\u00a0FSR 578 (\u201c<em>Chiron</em>\u201d) and <em>Bovis Lend Lease Ltd v Braehead Glasgow Ltd</em> (2000) 71\u00a0Con LR 208).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"/>23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are in agreement with this submission. This case does disclose, on the face of the pleadings, sufficient complex issues of fact and law to require a full trial to resolve them. However, this factor alone would not prevent the court from ordering an interim payment in respect of \u201cpart of a complex claim where (without venturing too far into disputed areas of fact or law) there is evidence establishing with reasonable certainty the minimum sum likely to be recoverable\u201d (English White Book at para\u00a015-113 citing <em>Chiron per</em> Robert Walker\u00a0J at 584). It is necessary to note that, in the present case, it is <em>not</em> the appellant\u2019s case that the respondents are not entitled to the return of their capital investment. The appellant\u2019s case is that there might be no capital to be returned, because of its cross-claims and, further, because the capital was not guaranteed. Its counsel submitted that its cross-claims might exceed the Stake. This submission is speculative because the only claim of the appellant that would affect the amount of the capital investment returnable to the respondents would be general damages which the appellant has claimed in respect of the alleged conspiracy to injure the appellant. But beyond recovering what the other policyholders have allegedly lost from the appellant\u2019s own mistake, it is difficult to see what loss the appellant itself has suffered on its own account. Accordingly, while it is relevant, we are not prepared to place too much weight on this submission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"/>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, as here, the respondents are entitled to recover their capital investment, which itself is a substantial sum, it is our view that the burden is on the appellant to satisfy the court why it should not order interim payment of any sum that is in law repayable to the respondents. The court should try to assess the irreducible sum that can be paid in the exercise of its discretion. The respondents should not be denied their own moneys to defend what appears to be a complex (and therefore costly) case on law and finance. Of course, it is possible that the court, in exercising its discretion to order interim payment, may err in paying out too much. The interim payment scheme under O\u00a029 of the Rules provides for such a contingency, as O\u00a029 r\u00a017 states as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>Adjustment on final judgment or order or on discontinuance (O.\u00a029, r.\u00a017)</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>17</b>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a defendant has been ordered to make an interim payment or has in fact made an interim payment, whether voluntarily or pursuant to an order, the Court may, in giving or making a final judgment or order, or granting the plaintiff leave to discontinue his action or to withdraw the claim in respect of which the interim payment has been made, or at any other stage of the proceedings on the application of any party, make such order with respect to the interim payment as may be just, and in particular\u00a0\u2014</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>a</em>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an order for the repayment by the plaintiff of all or part of the interim payment;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>b</em>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an order for the payment to be varied or discharged; or</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>c</em>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an order for the payment by any other defendant of any part of the interim payment which the defendant who made it is entitled to recover from him by way of contribution or indemnity or in respect of any remedy or relief relating to or connected with the plaintiff's claim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Order\u00a029 r\u00a017 shows that the role of the court in an application under O\u00a029 r\u00a012(<em>c</em>) is primarily to determine liability first. If the court makes a mistake in the amount awarded under an interim payment, it has wide powers under O\u00a029 r\u00a017 to make the necessary adjustment in the final judgment or order. The court will be mindful that, in making an interim payment award, it must take into account the applicant\u2019s ability to repay should a mistake in the amount awarded occur (see the English White Book at para\u00a015-106).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"/>25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We turn now to the facts on record. The appellant has conceded that the amount of money it can recover from the respondents, based on its claim for unjust enrichment by the respondents, would be the amount to which the respondents have been unjustly enriched. Mr\u00a0Knight made this point clear in his affidavit filed on 21\u00a0November 2008, where he said:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a id=\"Ftn_3_1\" href=\"#Ftn_3\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The [respondents\u2019] \u201cgains\u201d were made at the expense of other policyholders who held units in the Affected funds at relevant times during the Frequent Fund Switching Period (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAffected Policyholders\u201d).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">These gains are now comprised in: (a)\u00a0the amount of the Stake; and (b)\u00a0the sum of $429,436.43 (which includes the capital sum of $40,000) withdrawn by the second and fourth respondents under two ILPs. However, the Stake would also include the capital investment of the respondents which amounted to $1,019,300 (being the balance of the initial total investment of $1,059,300, after taking into account the $40,000 capital withdrawn earlier). The Judge ordered the sum of $1,019,300 to be paid out to the respondents because the appellant had conceded that the respondents were entitled to the return of their capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"/>26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before us, the appellant advanced two arguments that the Judge was wrong in ordering interim payment of the capital sum of $1,019,300. The first is that it has a claim for damages for conspiracy, and, if successful, it will be entitled to set off the damages against the capital sum in the Stake. The second is that the investments are not capital guaranteed, and therefore the capital sum might not be $1,019,300 at the material time (which has yet to be determined).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"/>27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the first argument, counsel admitted that he was unable to estimate what the damages were likely to be. We have earlier indicated that we are not persuaded of the prospect of the appellant being able to prove that it had suffered substantial loss personally, given that the real basis of the appellant\u2019s claim appeared to rest on unjust enrichment (the amount of which claim is now preserved in the Stake). However, counsel has also suggested that the appellant would have to incur considerable costs and expenses in pursuing the Suit in the form of expert and legal services. We do not think that costs and expenses are matters that the court is obliged to take into account at this stage of the proceedings or for the purposes of determining the amount of an interim payment order. They are speculative, as the appellant may not succeed in its claim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"/>28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is another way of looking at the relative rights of the appellant and the respondents with respect to their capital investment. The respondents are entitled to recover their capital investment (although the appellant has argued that the ILPs are not capital guaranteed). But subject to any such capital loss as may be proved and to any sum which might be awarded to the appellant on its claim for damages for conspiracy, the appellant has effectively been given a security for its claim on the respondents\u2019 capital investment. The position is analogous to that of the appellant having obtained a Mareva injunction to freeze the assets of the respondents to meet its claim. As pointed out by counsel for the respondents, even in a Mareva injunction scenario, the affected party would be entitled to withdraw sufficient funds from the \u201cfrozen\u201d funds to defray his legal and other expenses in order to defend the action against him. We think there is substance in this argument. Indeed, if the appellant had applied for a Mareva injunction in the circumstances of this case, we do not think that such an injunction would have been granted. There is no reason why the appellant should have the benefit of what is, in effect, a Mareva injunction in the light of the circumstances of this case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"/>29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the argument based on the potential loss of capital, the appellant has contended that, had the correct bid prices been applied at all material times, the value of the respondents\u2019 ILPs as at 31\u00a0July 2008 (being the last dealing day in which one-day-old bid prices were used for all the relevant funds) would have stood at $994,999 and would have dropped to $566,604 when the ILPs were finally liquidated on 22\u00a0October 2008. Like the Judge, we are also of the view that the relevance of these computations is dubious. What the true figure would have been is entirely speculative because any such figure would have to be based on the assumption that the respondents would have switched and continued to switch funds if the appellant had used the correct bid prices at all material times. It should be borne in mind that the appellant\u2019s case is that the respondents knew that the appellant had made a mistake in its terms of switching and that the respondents had taken advantage of the mistake. But when did this take place? Since the appellant is claiming that the respondents had been unjustly enriched by their fraudulent or tortious switches, the court will need to know the relevant date or dates from which the unjust enrichment is alleged to have started. The appellant has not identified the starting point of time but has only pleaded that the switching activities started sometime in July 2006 and continued until August 2008. Against this background of the appellant\u2019s claims and the pleadings, it is not necessary at this stage of the proceedings to decide whether counsel or the Judge is right. What we have on record are three figures that the appellant has produced in evidence, <em>viz</em>: (a)\u00a0$1,059,300 (less $40,000); (b)\u00a0$994,999 (as at 31\u00a0July 2008); and (c)\u00a0$566,604 (as at 22\u00a0October 2008).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"/>30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the appellant has failed to show <em>prima facie</em> that the amount that it is likely to be able to recover would be more than the Stake (after taking into account the respondents\u2019 capital investment), we consider it proper and reasonable to exercise our discretion in favour of the respondents and to order interim payment of as much money as is prudent, having regard to the relative strengths of the claims of the parties to the respondents\u2019 capital investment, and also the capacity of the respondents to repay any amount that might eventually turn out to be overpaid. In our view, we consider that a lump sum of $600,000 would be fair to both parties, as there is no evidence to suggest that each of the respondents would not be good for up to the amount of $60,000. We therefore propose to vary the Judge\u2019s interim payment order accordingly, subject to any order necessary under O\u00a029 r\u00a017 upon the final determination of the issues in the Suit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"/>31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before we conclude our judgment, we would like to make an observation on one aspect of the Judge\u2019s decision in order to clarify a matter which is obviously a matter of grave concern to the appellant. The Judge, in ordering interim payment, had also embarked on a construction of the provisions in the ILPs (see the GD at [46]\u2013[49]) that pertained to fund switching (\u201cthe Switching Provisions\u201d) and had come to the conclusion that the appellant had not made any mistake, as it had alleged, in allowing the respondents to switch funds applying one-day-old bid prices (see the GD at [46]\u2013[53]). However, as this interpretation would completely undermine the appellant\u2019s claims, the appellant has raised this issue for the decision of this court. Its contention was that the Judge\u2019s construction of the Switching Provisions was wrong. In our view, we regard the Judge\u2019s determination on the construction of the Switching Provisions as <em>obiter</em> as it was not necessary for him to embark upon this exercise since the order for interim payment could have been justified on the amounts conceded by the appellant as being recoverable by the respondents from their capital investment (see <a href=\"#p1_29\">[29]</a> above). In fact, the Judge had relied on this latter ground and the construction of the Switching Provisions was merely an alternative basis for the interim payment order made by him. We therefore do not propose to examine this issue at this stage of the proceedings. We have indicated to counsel for the appellant that this issue should be determined at the substantive hearing of the Suit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"/>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the above reasons, we order that the sum of $600,000 be paid to the respondents as interim payment. As the appeal has, in substance, been dismissed, costs are awarded to the respondents with the usual consequential orders.</p>\n\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><sup><a id=\"Ftn_1\" href=\"#Ftn_1_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>At para 20.7.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><sup><a id=\"Ftn_2\" href=\"#Ftn_2_1\">[note: 2]</a></sup>At para 8.4.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><sup><a id=\"Ftn_3\" href=\"#Ftn_3_1\">[note: 3]</a></sup>At para 8.4.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sometime\n\n  in early January 1996, Brentford Construction, which was carrying out construction work at\n\n  an adjacent lot to the estate, caused damage to some of the houses in the estate. As a\n\n  result of the damage, Chiu Teng had to carry out rectification works and sought to recover\n\n  the loss it suffered on account of the rectification works from Brentford. On 24 April\n\n  1998, Brentford was wound up by an order of court and the Official Receiver was appointed\n\n  as liquidator. In view of Brentford\u2019s winding up, Chiu Teng had to obtain leave of\n\n  court to commence proceedings against it. On 11 May 1999, an interlocutory judgment was\n\n  obtained with the consent of the Official Receiver. On 30 May, judgment for the sum of $\n\n  466,600.08 was granted to Chui Teng. Hartford who was informed of this action chose not to\n\n  get involved as it felt that it was not liable to Brentford under the policy. \n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Chiu Teng, in reliance of s 1(1) of the Third party (Rights against\n\n  Insurers) Act commenced the present action against Hartford seeking payment of the\n\n  judgment sum. In the court below, Harford raised two main lines of defence. The first line\n\n  related to policy defences which the court ruled was without any merits. The second line\n\n  of defence was that the judgment sum obtained by Chiu Teng against Brentford was not\n\n  binding on Hartford and that Chiu Teng should prove all over again the quantum of the\n\n  loss. In this defence, Hartford did not dispute Brentford\u2019s liability to Chiu Teng,\n\n  but only the reasonableness of the latter\u2019s claim. The trial judge held that Hartford\n\n  was, by virtue of the earlier judgment, estopped from challenging the extent of liability\n\n  or the quantum which the court had held Brentford to be liable to Chiu Teng. This was\n\n  because under the insurance policy, Brentford was entitled to be indemnified by Hartford\n\n  as to the judgment sum. Since under s1(1) of the Act, following the winding up of\n\n  Brentford, Chiu Teng stepped into the shoes of Brentford, Chiu Teng should similarly be\n\n  entitled to be indemnified by Hartford. Hartford appealed against the trial judge\u2019s\n\n  ruling that the earlier judgment obtained by Chiu Teng against Brentford was binding and\n\n  conclusive as against Hartford. It contended that estoppel does not apply in the present\n\n  case and that it is entitled to question the quantum of the loss suffered by Chiu Teng.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Held</strong>, dismissing the appeal :</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(1) A judgment is generally only binding as between the parties to the\n\n  action, except in the case of an express indemnity given by a third party to a party to\n\n  the action: see Mercantile Investment &amp; General Trust. At common law, Chiu Teng would\n\n  have no claim against Hartford, the insurer: Re Harrington Motor Co [1928] 1 Ch 105.\n\n  However, because of the winding up of Brentford, s 1(1) enables Chiu Teng to step into the\n\n  shoes of Brentford. Brentford\u2019s right to be indemnified in respect of the liability\n\n  is, under s 1(1), transferred to Chiu Teng. ( 25 \u2013 26)</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(2) It is not open to Hartford, who was notified of the previous\n\n  action, to reopen the question of quantum of loss. Judgment had already been obtained on\n\n  that. To permit such a challenge as to the extent of liability of Brentford to Chiu Teng,\n\n  and consequently the quantum thereof, would risk there being an inconsistent judgment and\n\n  the insured being indemnified less (or none at all) than what the policy provides. And as\n\n  by virtue of s 1(1), Chiu Teng stepped into the shoes of Brentford, Chiu Teng should be\n\n  indemnified by Hartford. There is no question of Chiu Teng being given any additional\n\n  advantage which would not be available to Brentford in any action instituted by Brentford\n\n  against Hartford. ( 24) </p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(3) Where an insurer forms the view that he is not liable to indemnify\n\n  his insured, then he has at least two options. The first is to refuse or withdraw cover in\n\n  respect of any defence to the pursuer\u2019s action. In that event, if the third party\n\n  proceeds with his action and secures decree against the person thought to be insured, the\n\n  amount of the decree will be determinative of the liability of the insured to the third\n\n  party unless and until that decree is reduced on the grounds of, for example, fraud or\n\n  collusion. The insurer cannot normally re-open the question of the amount of the liability\n\n  in circumstances where he has declined to enter the process and fund the defence to the\n\n  action or has withdrawn his instructions and funding in the course of the action. The\n\n  question of liability between the third party and the insured has to be litigated in an\n\n  action between those two parties and a decree in that action has to be seen as a final\n\n  determination of that liability so long as the decree stands unreduced. The second option\n\n  is for the insurer to offer to instruct the defence to the action but make it clear ab\n\n  ante, or at least as soon as possible, both to the third party and the insured, that his\n\n  position is to remain that he is not liable under the policy. The choice is entirely for\n\n  the insurer. If it chooses not to intervene, then, if a judgment is obtained against the\n\n  insured, it would have to indemnify the insured if the policy defences pleaded by it\n\n  should fail.

The issue which arose for consideration concerns the construction of s 1(1)\n\nof the English Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 1930 (the 1930 Act), which\n\nstatute was made applicable in Singapore by virtue of the Application of English Law Act\n\n(Cap 7A).\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nThe background</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The facts of the case are quite straightforward. The respondents,\n\nChiu Teng Construction Co Pte Ltd (\"Chiu Teng\"), were the main contractors of a\n\nhousing development located at the junction of Yio Chu Kang Road and Lentor Avenue known\n\nas \"The Countryside\" (the \"estate\"). Sometime in early January 1996,\n\nthe insured under the policy, Brentford Construction (S) Pte Ltd (\"Brentford\"),\n\nwas carrying out sheet-pile extraction works at an adjacent lot to the estate. These works\n\ncaused soil movement which resulted in damage to some of the houses in the estate. Because\n\nof that, rectification works had to be carried out by Chiu Teng, which included the\n\ninstallation of some 30 micropiles as foundation supports for the boundary walls and\n\nretaining walls of the affected houses. Chiu Teng\u2019s engineer had doubts whether the\n\nfrictional resistance of the existing foundation would be adequate to secure the\n\nstructures and thus advised that the micropiles be installed. The costs of this item alone\n\namounted to slightly more than 50% of the total expenses incurred by Chiu Teng in relation\n\nto the rectification works.</p>\n\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the terms of the policy, Hartford agreed to indemnify\n\nBrentford against \"such sums which Brentford shall become legally liable to pay as\n\ndamages\" consequent upon accidental loss or damage to property belonging to third\n\nparties occurring in direct connection with the construction or erection works carried out\n\nby Brentford. Hartford also agreed, in respect of a claim for compensation to which the\n\nindemnity applied, that it would, in addition, indemnify Brentford against all costs and\n\nexpenses of litigation which Brentford had to pay to the third party claimant.</p>\n\n<p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24 April 1998, Brentford was wound up by an order of court,\n\nwith the Official Receiver being appointed liquidator. Chiu Teng sought to recover the\n\nloss it suffered on account of the rectification works from Brentford. In view of\n\nBrentford\u2019s winding up, on 12 February 1999, leave of court was obtained by Chiu Teng\n\nto commence proceedings against it. A writ was duly issued on 16 March 1999. On 11 May\n\n1999, an interlocutory judgment was obtained with the consent of the Official Receiver. On\n\n30 May 2000, an assessment of damages was conducted. Witnesses were called on behalf of\n\nChiu Teng. The Official Receiver chose not to participate in the assessment. Judgment for\n\nthe sum of $466,600.08 was granted to Chiu Teng, with interest at 6% p.a. from the date on\n\nwhich the writ was served on Brentford (collectively referred to as \"the judgment\n\nsum\"). We should add that Hartford was informed of this action but chose not to get\n\ninvolved as it felt it was not liable to Brentford under the policy. For convenience, this\n\njudgment shall hereinafter be referred to as \"the earlier judgment\".</p>\n\n<p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 11 August 2000, in reliance on s 1(1) of the 1930 Act, Chiu\n\nTeng commenced the present action against Hartford seeking payment of the judgment sum.</p>\n\n<p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the court below, Hartford raised two main lines of defence. The\n\nfirst line related to policy defences (i.e., that the damage caused did not fall within\n\nthe scope of the policy), which the court below ruled were without any merits. Of course,\n\nif the court had held in favour of Hartford on these defences, then Chiu Teng, who stepped\n\ninto the shoes of Brentford, could have no better claim against Hartford. A related\n\ndefence, based on limitation, also failed. We need say no more on these policy defences\n\nbecause before us Hartford is not challenging these rulings of the court below.</p>\n\n<p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second line of defence was that the judgment sum obtained by\n\nChiu Teng against Brentford was not binding on Hartford and, that Chiu Teng should prove\n\nall over again the quantum of their loss. In this defence, Hartford did not dispute\n\nBrentford's liability to Chiu Teng, but only the reasonableness of the latter's claim and,\n\nspecifically, it said that it was wholly unnecessary for Chiu Teng to install the\n\nmicropiles and that the costs incurred thereby should be irrecoverable.</p>\n\n<p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge below, Woo Bih Li JC, also rejected this second line of\n\ndefence. He held that Hartford was, by virtue of the earlier judgment, estopped from\n\nchallenging the extent of liability or the quantum which the court had held Brentford to\n\nbe liable to Chiu Teng. It was unnecessary for Chiu Teng to establish all over again the\n\nreasonableness of its claim. His reasoning was simply this: under the policy, Brentford\n\nwas entitled to be indemnified by Hartford as to the judgment sum and as under s 1(1) of\n\nthe 1930 Act, following the winding up of Brentford, Chiu Teng stepped into the shoes of\n\nBrentford, Chiu Teng should similarly be entitled to be indemnified by Hartford.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nAppeal</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, the main contention of Hartford is that the judge below\n\nerred when he held that the earlier judgment obtained by Chiu Teng against Brentford was\n\nbinding and conclusive as against Hartford. It argued that such a decision would require\n\nan insurer to engage itself in legal proceedings even before it is established that the\n\ninsurer is liable to indemnify the insured in respect of the losses allegedly caused by\n\nthe insured to a third party. This could not be correct. Unnecessary costs would thereby\n\nhave to be incurred by the insurer and this, in turn, would have a detrimental effect on\n\ninsureds in general, as it could lead to an escalation of premiums payable.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nThe authorities</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The starting point for the consideration of the issue must be the\n\ncase <i>Parker v Lewis</i> [1873] 8 Chancery App 1035 where the facts were somewhat\n\ncomplicated. The case involved the directors of a bank and two related companies in a\n\nscheme to deceive the Stock Exchange by making it appear that one of the two companies had\n\nmoneys which it did not have and to also make it appear that the company had allotted\n\n40,000 shares which were paid for and which was not the case. The scheme was intended to\n\ndeceive all the persons, who might be induced by means of that sham, into taking up shares\n\nin the company. Shareholders of the bank brought an action against the directors of the\n\nbank for an indemnity. The substantive decision of the case concerned a procedural point\n\nas to the proper party to bring an action on behalf of the company. However, Mellish LJ\n\nexpressed the following <i>obiter dicta</i> as to what an indemnifier could dispute in a\n\ncase of an express contract of indemnity:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"I think that the law with reference to express contracts of\n\n  indemnity is, that if a person has agreed to indemnify another against a particular claim\n\n  or a particular demand, and an action is brought on that demand, he may then give notice\n\n  to the person who has agreed to indemnify him to come in and defend the action, and if he\n\n  does not come in, and refuses to come in, he may then compromise at once on the best terms\n\n  he can, and then bring an action on the contract of indemnity. On the other hand, if he\n\n  does not choose to trust the other person with the defence to the action, he may, if he\n\n  pleases, go on and defend it, and then, if the verdict is obtained against him, and\n\n  judgment signed upon it, I agree that at law that judgment, in the case of express\n\n  contract of indemnity is conclusive. But I apprehend it is conclusive on account of what\n\n  the law considers the true meaning of such a contract of indemnity to be. It is obvious\n\n  that when a person has entered into a bond, or bought land, or altered his position in any\n\n  way on the faith of a contract of indemnity, and an action is brought against him for the\n\n  matter against which he was indemnified, and a verdict of a jury obtained against him, it\n\n  would be very hard, indeed, if, when he came to claim the indemnity, the person against\n\n  whom he claimed it could fight the question over again, and run the chance of whether a\n\n  second jury would take a different view and give an opposite verdict to the first.\n\n  Therefore, by reason of that contract of indemnity, the judgment is conclusive; but in my\n\n  opinion it is conclusive because that is the meaning of the contract between the parties,\n\n  for it unquestionably is not the general rule of law that a judgment obtained by A against\n\n  B is conclusive in an action by B against C.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Post Office v Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society Ltd [</i>1967]\n\n1 All ER, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the need for an insured (and in turn the injured\n\nthird party who steps into the shoes of the insured under s 1 of the 1930 Act) to\n\nestablish that he is legally liable to pay compensation to the third party before an\n\naction against the insurers to seek indemnity may be made. In that case the public\n\nliability policy provided that the insurer \"will indemnify (the insured) against all\n\nsums which (the insured) shall become legally liable to pay as compensation in respect of\n\n\u2026 loss of or damage to property.\" The Post Office (the third party) sued the\n\ninsurers claiming for the loss of damage in the sum of about 839, as statutory assignees\n\nof the insured by virtue of s 1(1) of the 1930 Act. The Court of Appeal noted that while\n\nthe liability of the insured to the Post Office arose at the time of the accident, the\n\n\"rights\" of the insured against the insurers did not arise at that time but\n\nhaving regard to the scope of the policy, only when the insured\u2019s liability \"to\n\nthe injured person has been established\" and, that liability must be\n\n\"ascertained and determined to exist, either by judgment of the court or by an award\n\nin an arbitration or by agreement.\" Lord Denning MR specifically addressed the\n\nprocedural problem which would arise where the insured was a company and had been wound\n\nup, as follows:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"How is this to be done? If there is an unascertained claim for\n\n  damages in tort, it cannot be proved in the bankruptcy, nor in the liquidation of the\n\n  company; but the injured person can bring an action against the wrongdoer. In the case of\n\n  a company, he must get the leave of the court. No doubt leave would automatically be\n\n  given. The insurance company can fight that action in the name of the wrongdoer. In that\n\n  way liability can be established and the loss ascertained. Then the injured person can go\n\n  against the insurance company.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hartford relies on the case <i>Mercantile Investment &amp;\n\nGeneral Trust Co v River Plate Trust, Loan and Agency Co</i> [1894] 1 Ch 578 to contend\n\nthat estoppel does not apply in the present case and that it is entitled to question the\n\nquantum of the loss suffered by Chiu Teng. In that case, an English company purchased the\n\nundertaking and property of an American company and covenanted to indemnify the American\n\ncompany against its debts and obligations. Pursuant to a power of compromise contained in\n\na debenture trust deed given by the American company, a resolution was passed by a\n\nmajority of the debenture holders accepting, in lieu of the debentures, shares in the\n\nEnglish company. The Mercantile Company, which did not agree with the resolution on the\n\nground that the condition necessary for the exercise of the power had not existed,\n\nabsented itself from the meeting. It subsequently sued and obtained a judgment against the\n\nAmerican company for arrears of interest due on their debentures. The English company\n\nassisted the American companies in defence of that action and even paid the costs thereof.\n\nIn a second action, the Mercantile Company, suing on behalf of all the debenture holders,\n\nsought to enforce against the English Company and the lands assigned to them by the\n\nAmerican company, the charge on such lands purported to be given by the debentures. The\n\nlands were located in Mexico. Due to an omission to effect registration of the charge,\n\nwhich registration was essential, the debenture holders thus never acquired a valid charge\n\non the land according to the law of Mexico. </p>\n\n<p>13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Romer J held that the judgment obtained by the Mercantile Company\n\ndid not estop the English company from adducing evidence to show that through\n\nnon-registration of the charge under the debenture, circumstances had existed which were\n\nsufficient to bring the power of compromise into operation and the resolution was\n\ntherefore binding on the Mercantile Company.</p>\n\n<p>14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the decision in that case is distinguishable and\n\nthis can be gleaned from the following passage of Romer J (at 595):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"In that action the (Mercantile company) were only seeking to\n\n  enforce in this country a personal claim against the American Company; and the American\n\n  Company in their defence and counter-claim were seeking to free themselves and their\n\n  assets, including the land in question, from a personal claim and not from a claim\n\n  constituting, if established, a valid charge on the land. Nothing was decided in that\n\n  action which in any way bound the land,</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Lastly, it was said that, inasmuch as the American Company defended\n\n  with the knowledge and approval of the English Company, the latter would be estopped under\n\n  their covenant of indemnity from disputing the judgment as against the American Company\n\n  suing them on the express covenant of indemnity. That is quite true. But this is not an\n\n  action on the covenant of indemnity. The estoppel last referred to is only between the\n\n  party indemnifying and the party indemnified, and arises only by virtue of a term implied\n\n  in an express covenant of indemnity.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from the peculiar features in the case, it is important to\n\nnote that there was, then, no equivalent provision to s 1(1) of the 1930 Act which the\n\ncourt there had to consider. But it would be seen that Romer J held that estoppel would\n\nhave applied if the American company were to sue the English company on the indemnity. The\n\neffect of s 1(1) is to enable Chiu Teng to step into the shoes of Brentford. On the\n\nprinciple spelt out by Romer J, if Brentford were to sue Hartford, the latter would be\n\nestopped. And since under s 1(1) Chiu Teng stepped into the shoes of Brentford, Hartford\n\nshould similarly be estopped in the action by Chiu Teng.</p>\n\n<p>16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Malaysian case, <i>Tee Liam Toh v National Employer\u2019s\n\nMutual General Insurance Association Ltd </i>(unreported) (OM No 50 of 1963), is also\n\npertinent. There, the plaintiff who was the employer of an employee-driver, took out a\n\nworkman\u2019s compensation policy with the insurers. The driver, while loading some goods\n\ncollapsed and died of heart failure. The dependants of the driver claimed for\n\nworkmen\u2019s compensation. The employer disputed the claim. The arbitrator under the\n\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Ordinance ruled against the employer-plaintiff (first\n\narbitration). The plaintiff claimed for indemnity under the policy against the insurers\n\nwho resisted the claim. The dispute went before an arbitrator (second arbitration) who\n\nheld that the driver\u2019s death was due to natural causes and that the injury did not\n\narise out of or in the course of the employment. Accordingly, the insurers were held not\n\nliable to indemnify the employer-plaintiff and the latter in turn moved the High Court to\n\nhave the second award remitted for re-consideration or set aside. Ong J held that as the\n\nfirst arbitration was properly constituted and an award was given, the insurers were\n\nprecluded from raising the same question again before the second arbitration and they\n\nshould pay the employer-plaintiff in accordance with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation\n\npolicy unless they could show that the employer-plaintiff was in breach of any of the\n\nconditions of the policy. As there was an error on the face of the second award in not\n\ngiving effect to the estoppel, Ong J remitted the second award for re-consideration by the\n\narbitrator. In coming to his decision, Ong J had relied upon the views expressed by\n\nMellish LJ in <i>Parker v Lewis</i> (quoted in 10 above). He amplified his ruling as\n\nfollows:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"\u2026 with full notice of a claim against their insured, the\n\n  insurance company elected to lift not a finger to assist their insured or protect\n\n  themselves by defending the claim. Under condition three they had the right to take over\n\n  conduct of the defence against the claim put forward by the dependants of the deceased,\n\n  and, if dissatisfied with the decision, they should have appealed. Having left their\n\n  insured to carry the burden, they nevertheless subsequently insisted on raising the very\n\n  same questions before the arbitrator which had already been decided by a competent\n\n  tribunal against their insured. Of course, they are precluded by the decision of the\n\n  learned President, as arbitrator, from agitating these questions again.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should add that counsel for Hartford does not question the\n\ndecision in <i>Tee Liam Toh</i> but only seeks to distinguish it from the present case on\n\nthe basis that in the earlier action by Chiu Teng against Brentford, the latter did not\n\ndispute the quantum of claim of Chiu Teng, whereas in <i>Teo Liam Toh</i> the questions of\n\nliability and quantum were thrashed out in the first arbitration. It is therefore\n\nnecessary for us to determine whether this distinction is really valid in the context of s\n\n1(1).</p>\n\n<p>18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are two other cases cited by Hartford which we must refer\n\nto. The first is <i>Ben Shipping Co (Pte) Ltd v An Bord Bainne The C Joyce</i> [1986] 2 All ER 177. There, cargo owners claimed damages against the shipowners for damage to cargo\n\nand short delivery. The shipowners invited the charterers to take over the defence on the\n\nbasis that under the terms of the charterparty the ultimate responsibility for the loss of\n\nthe cargo would rest with the charterers. The charterers refused to accept the invitation\n\npresumably because they did not think they had to indemnify the shipowners. The shipowners\n\nsettled the claim and sought to be indemnified by the charterers. Bingham J (as he then\n\nwas) held that the charterers were not liable under the charterparty to indemnify the\n\nshipowners. However, he went on to express the view that, even if the charterers were so\n\nliable, they were not precluded from contesting the liability of the shipowners to the\n\ncargo owners and/or the reasonableness of the settlement of the claim. We think it highly\n\nrelevant to note the conclusion of Bingham J where he said (at p. 187):-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\" \u2026 to succeed in their estoppel claim, the shipowners must\n\n  establish as a matter of law that having given notice to the charterers of the claim made\n\n  against them (the shipowners) in South Africa, and the charterers having declined to\n\n  conduct the defence, and the shipowners having compromised the claim, they (the\n\n  charterers) are estopped from contesting the liability of the shipowners to the third\n\n  party in South Africa and the reasonableness of the compromise and the incurring of costs,\n\n  <u>even though there was no express contract of indemnity and the charterers bona fide and\n\n  on reasonable grounds challenged the shipowners\u2019 right to indemnity and the claim was\n\n  settled without immediate reference to the charterers.</u> I do not think any such\n\n  principle can be clearly found in the authorities relied on. Nor do I think it desirable\n\n  to attempt to lay down such a far reaching principle. It is of course good sense and\n\n  common practice for a defendant to give notice of a claim against him and any proposed\n\n  settlement to a person against whom he intends to seek indemnity or contribution, if such\n\n  person is not joined as a third party. This gives that person the opportunity to raise any\n\n  points or objections he wishes, and will make it somewhat harder for him to raise\n\n  arguments later which he could have raised at the time. It is, however, a large stride\n\n  from a commonsense tactical practice to a rule of law. The present case is a good example\n\n  of how unfairly such a rule could work. The charterers did not (it seems reasonable to\n\n  infer) believe they were bound to indemnify the shipowners against the South African\n\n  claim. <u>Even if one assumes that they were wrong in that belief, it remains the fact\n\n  that they need have had and in all probability had no knowledge at all of how the cargo\n\n  damage occurred. Having dissociated themselves from the proceedings they knew nothing of\n\n  the terms of settlement.</u> The rule contended for would present the charterers with a\n\n  choice between taking over the defence of a claim which they believed to be nothing to do\n\n  with them and thereafter (if that belief was falsified) finding themselves bound to\n\n  indemnify the shipowners against settlement of a claim even though the claim could be\n\n  shown to be ill-founded or the settlement unreasonable. The authorities may well support,\n\n  and I can see virtue in, a much more limited principle, but that would not avail the\n\n  shipowners here.\" (emphasis added).</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second is the recent Scottish case, <i>Cheltenhem &amp;\n\nGloucester plc v Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Co</i> (delivered on 30 May 2001)\n\nwhere the Inner House (Court of Session), overruling a decision of the Outer House and\n\nheld that the insurers were entitled to dispute the insured\u2019s liability to the third\n\nparty as part of a defence to a claim under the insurance policy bought by the insured,\n\neven if that liability had already been established by a court judgment. There, the\n\nplaintiffs sued a solicitor for professional negligence. The solicitor\u2019s insurers\n\ninvestigated the plaintiff\u2019s claim and, for a time, conducted the solicitor\u2019s\n\ndefence, before withdrawing from that proceeding in the belief that they could avoid\n\nliability under the policy. The solicitor did not thereafter defend the action and\n\njudgment was given against him. The Inner House held that, in those circumstances, the\n\ninsurers were entitled to dispute the insured\u2019s liability to the plaintiffs in the\n\naction brought by the plaintiffs under s 1(1) of the 1930 Act. The court, proceeding on\n\nthe basis that there was no authority on point, reasoned (at 10):-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"In other words, the pursuers\u2019 rights are co-extensive with,\n\n  but no greater than, St Clair\u2019s (the solicitor\u2019s) rights against the defenders.\n\n  That being so, the decree in the sheriff court action between the pursuers and St Clair\n\n  will be conclusive as to St Clair\u2019s liability in damages for the purposes of the\n\n  present action at the instance of the pursuers only if it would also be conclusive for the\n\n  purposes of an action against the defenders at the instance of St Clair. So, supposing\n\n  that St Clair had been found liable in damages to the pursuers in the sheriff court\n\n  action, would the defenders have been prevented from challenging that liability and its\n\n  amount in any proceedings which he brought against them to enforce the indemnity under the\n\n  insurance policy? In general terms, part, at least, of the answer is clear: the matter\n\n  would not be <i>res judicata</i>, since the parties to the two actions would be different\n\n  and the <i>media concludendi</i> would also be different. The existence of the sheriff\n\n  court decree would therefore give St Clair the necessary interest to sue the defenders but\n\n  it would not prevent them from reopening the matter in an action against them at his\n\n  instance. For this reason the existence of the sheriff court decree cannot, in itself,\n\n  prevent the defenders from reopening the matter in the present action where the pursuers\n\n  stand in St Clair\u2019s shoes.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Inner House also dealt with the prevailing problem which the\n\nenactment of the 1930 Act was intended to overcome as follows (at 12):-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Parliament solved the problem by enacting the provisions of\n\n  Section 1 which in effect assigned the insured\u2019s rights against the insurer to the\n\n  third party. But there is nothing in the terms of the 1930 Act or in the aims of the\n\n  legislation that would justify the inference that Parliament intended to give the third\n\n  party any additional advantage which would not be available to the insured in any action\n\n  at his instance against the insurer.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far as <i>Ben Shipping</i> case is concerned, it is clearly\n\ndistinguishable as it did not deal with an express obligation to indemnify but with a\n\nsupposedly implied obligation of indemnity. It must be confined to its fact situation as\n\nthe passage of Bingham J which we have cited at 18 above shows. There were also special\n\nfeatures there which seemed to have played a part in the overall determination of the\n\ncase. It would be noted that Bingham J did not rule that the indemnifier could never be\n\nbound. He recognised that the authorities could well support a \"much more limited\n\nprinciple.\"</p>\n\n<p>22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards <i>Cheltenhem &amp; Gloucester</i> case, we note that\n\nthe Inner House, in coming to its decision, had relied upon <i>Ben Shipping</i>. With\n\nrespect, we think insufficient consideration was given to the distinguishing factors in <i>Ben\n\nShipping</i> which we had identified above. </p>\n\n<p>23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for Chiu Teng further seeks to distinguish <i>Cheltenhem\n\n&amp; Gloucester</i> on the basis that the wording of the operative clause of the\n\nindemnity was different. There, it was stated that the insurers would \"indemnify the\n\ninsured against liability at law for damages and claimant\u2019s costs and expenses in\n\nrespect of a claim \u2026 made against the insured \u2026 by reason of any negligent act,\n\nneglect or omission on the part of the \u2026 insured \u2026 occurring or committed \u2026\n\nin good faith.\" In contrast, in our case, the insurer was to indemnify Brentford\n\nagainst \"such sums which Brentford shall become legally liable to pay as\n\ndamages.\" While the two clauses are indeed different, we do not think there is any\n\nreal difference in effect, since in this case and in <i>Cheltenhem &amp; Gloucester</i>\n\nthere is, in each instance, a judgment against the insured.</p>\n\n<p>24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is clear is that the Inner House seemed to be concerned with\n\nthe doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>. As we see it, the real point is one of contract. The\n\nquestion to ask is, following from the first judgment, is there a sum which Brentford is\n\nlegally liable to pay to Chiu Teng as damages. The answer is a definite yes. The wording\n\nof the policy is clear: the insurer (Hartford) shall indemnify the insured (Brentford)\n\nagainst such sums which Brentford shall become legally liable to pay as damages. This\n\ncondition is satisfied. It is not open to Hartford to challenge that judgment; they were\n\nnotified of the claim. To permit such a challenge as to the extent of liability of\n\nBrentford to Chiu Teng, and consequently the quantum thereof, would risk there being an\n\ninconsistent judgment and the insured being indemnified less (or none at all) than what\n\nthe policy provides. And as by virtue of s 1(1), Chiu Teng stepped into the shoes of\n\nBrentford, Chiu Teng should be indemnified by Hartford. There is no question of Chiu Teng\n\nbeing given any additional advantage which would not be available to Brentford in any\n\naction instituted by Brentford against Hartford.</p>\n\n<p>25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generally, and as stated by Romer J in <i>Mercantile Investment\n\n&amp; General Trust</i> (supra), a judgment is only binding as between the parties to the\n\naction, except in the case of an express indemnity given by a third party to a party to\n\nthe action. </p>\n\n<p>26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At common law, Chiu Teng would have no claim against Hartford,\n\nthe insurer: <i>Re Harrington Motor Co</i> [1928] 1 Ch 105. Now, because of the winding up\n\nof Brentford, s 1(1) enables Chiu Teng to step into the shoes of Brentford.\n\nBrentford\u2019s right to be indemnified in respect of the liability is, under s 1(1),\n\ntransferred to Chiu Teng. It is not open to Hartford to reopen the question of quantum of\n\nloss. Judgment had already been obtained on that. As stated by Devlin J in <i>West Wake\n\nPrice &amp; Co v Ching</i> [1957] 1 WLR 45 at 49, \"The essence of the main indemnity\n\nclauses is that the assured must prove a loss. The assured cannot recover anything under\n\nthe main indemnity clause or make any claim against the underwriters until they have been\n\nfound liable and so sustained a loss.\"</p>\n\n<p>27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We do not think it should make a difference whether the judgment\n\nobtained against the insured is after a trial or on admission, so long as notice was given\n\nto the insurer to defend the claim of the injured third party if it wished. Unlike the\n\ncharterers in <i>Ben Shipping</i>, who did not know how the loss occurred, here it is\n\nHartford who is raising the point that the installation of the micropiles was unnecessary\n\nafter judgment was given against Brentford. We would mention that Hartford\u2019s loss\n\nadjusters were kept informed by Chiu Teng\u2019s loss adjusters on the list of defects and\n\nthe proposed rectification works. Nothing was raised by Hartford\u2019s loss adjusters\n\nabout the need or otherwise of the micropiles. It is absurd to require an insured to\n\ncontest a claim, or the quantum thereof, if he does not have any basis to contest it.</p>\n\n<p>28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would, therefore, respectfully decline to follow the decision\n\nof the Inner House in <i>Cheltenhem &amp; Gloucester</i> and instead say that we agree\n\nwith the approach taken by the Outer House, which broadly followed the opinion expressed\n\nby Mellish LJ in <i>Parker v Lewis</i> (see 10 above). It said:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Where the insurer, on the other hand, forms the view that he is not\n\n  liable to indemnify his insured, then he still has at least two options. The first is to\n\n  refuse or withdraw cover in respect of any defence to the pursuer\u2019s action. In that\n\n  event, if the pursuer proceeds with his action and secures decree against the person\n\n  thought to be insured, the amount of the decree will be determinative of the liability of\n\n  the insured to the pursuer unless and until that decree is reduced on the grounds of, for\n\n  example, fraud or collusion. The insurer cannot normally re-open the question of the\n\n  amount of the liability in circumstances where he has declined to enter the process and\n\n  fund the defence to the action or has withdrawn his instructions and funding in the course\n\n  of the action. The question of liability between the pursuer and the insured has to be\n\n  litigated in an action between those two parties and a decree in that action has to be\n\n  seen as a final determination of that liability so long as the decree stands unreduced.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The second option is for the insurer to offer to instruct the defence\n\n  to the action but make it clear <i>ab ante, </i>or at least as soon as possible, both to\n\n  the pursuer and the insured, that his position is to remain that he is not liable under\n\n  the policy.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The choice is entirely for the insurer. If it chooses not to\n\nintervene, then, if a judgment is obtained against the insured, it would have to indemnify\n\nthe insured if the policy defences pleaded by it should fail. As regards the concern\n\nraised that if this court should uphold the decision of the court below, it could lead to\n\nan escalation in premiums, we would make three observations. First, this is not a legal\n\npoint. Secondly, a term which gives the insurer the right to conduct the defence of the\n\ninsured is commonplace in most insurance contracts and such a term is in the policy issued\n\nby Hartford to Brentford. Thirdly, while each insurer will set its own premium rates, in a\n\nfree and competitive economy, the market will ultimately dictate the acceptable levels.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nJudgment</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, the appellant\u2019s (Hartford\u2019s) appeal is\n\nhereby dismissed with costs.

These proceedings are yet another chapter in the long history of litigation between the parties, the background of which we have previously set out in <i>Murakami Takako v Wiryadi Louise Maria</i> <nobr>[2007] 4 SLR 565</nobr> (\u201c<i>Murakami Takako</i>\u201d) at [3]\u2013[5].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In these proceedings, the appellant, acting on behalf of the estate of her late father, Takashi Murakami Suroso (\u201cthe Testator\u201d), applied to include certain amendments which would expand her claim to include the following:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 moneys contained in two bank accounts with Westpac Bank in Australia (\u201cthe moneys in the Australian bank accounts\u201d);</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 five immovable properties and sale proceeds from three other immovable properties situated in Australia; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 four immovable properties and sale proceeds from one other immovable property situated in Indonesia.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge allowed only the amendments pertaining to the moneys in the Australian bank accounts. He held that the court had no jurisdiction over the claims to the specified foreign immovable properties (\u201cthe foreign immovable properties\u201d) and the sale proceeds from the other specified foreign immovable properties (\u201cthe other foreign properties\u201d), and that, even if the court had jurisdiction, he would have declined to exercise it on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The issues on appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondents have not appealed against the decision of the Judge to allow the amendments pertaining to the moneys in the Australian bank accounts and their counsel has confirmed that they are content to rest with that decision. Therefore, the issues that arise for our consideration pertain only to whether the Judge rightly disallowed the amendments with regard to the foreign immovable properties and the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge held that the appellant\u2019s claims to the foreign immovable properties and the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties (\u201cthe Claims\u201d) were caught by the rule in <i>The British South Africa Company v The Companhia de Mo\u00e7ambique</i> [1893] AC 602 (\u201cthe <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule\u201d), the effect of which is that the court has no jurisdiction to determine the title to, or the right to possession of, any immovable property situated outside the forum. The Judge considered one of the main exceptions to the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule, <i>viz</i>, that jurisdiction could be assumed where the claim was in equity (\u201cthe personal equities exception\u201d), and held that it did not apply on the facts of the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the words of a leading expert in the field (see Adrian Briggs, <i>Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments</i> (LLP, 4th\u00a0Ed, 2005) at para\u00a04.06), the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">... reflects the practical fact that only at the <i>situs</i></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">of the land can there be an effective determination of title. Even if an English court [in these proceedings, a Singapore court] were to hear the case, and were to choose and apply the law which a court at the <i>situs</i> would itself have applied, it is probable that its judgment will be ignored at the <i>situs</i> as one coming from a court with no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue. Acceptance of this fact is the pragmatic reason why the court has no jurisdiction to try questions of disputed title to foreign land. And because the issue is one where the court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the claim, the purported submission of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court is irrelevant: what the court lacks is subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[One] \u2026 exception [to the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule] is ancient and equitable in origin. According to the principle laid down in <i>Penn</i> v. <i>Lord\u00a0Baltimore</i> [(1750) 1\u00a0Ves\u00a0Sen 444; 27\u00a0ER 1132], though a court may have no jurisdiction to try a question of title to the land, this does not affect its jurisdiction to adjudicate on and enforce a contract, or fiduciary or other equitable obligation, between and binding on the parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although a vigorous assault was made on the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule in the House of Lords decision of <i>Hesperides Hotels Ltd v Muftizade</i> [1979] AC 508, the rule (as well as its exceptions, including the personal equities exception) was ultimately affirmed in that case (notwithstanding the court\u2019s acknowledgment of the various critiques of the rule itself). Indeed, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce was of the view that the nature of the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule was such that any possible reform would need to be effected via legislation instead of judicial decision (see <i>id</i> at 537).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to note \u2212 particularly in the context of the present proceedings and for reasons that will become apparent in the course of this judgment \u2212 that the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule is one of <i>subject-matter</i> <i>jurisdiction</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is equally important to note that the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule and the personal equities exception are part of Singapore law (see the decision of this court in <i>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 97</nobr> (\u201c<i>Eng Liat Kiang</i>\u201d) at 100\u2013103, [11]\u2013[19], where the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule was assumed to be (as also noted in the preceding paragraph) one relating to <i>jurisdiction</i>). The court, therefore, generally has no jurisdiction over claims to foreign immovable properties except for, <i>inter alia</i>, claims in equity with respect to equitable obligations. In this case, the Claims lie in equity; they are trust claims. It follows that the personal equities exception <i>prima facie</i> applies and the court has jurisdiction over the Claims. The crux of this appeal is therefore twofold, namely:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the Judge correctly found that the court did not have jurisdiction over the Claims; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if the court indeed has jurisdiction, whether the Judge rightly declined to exercise it on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addressing these issues, the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the foreign immovable properties and the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties will be considered together. We do not agree with counsel for the appellant that the claims to the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties are no different from the claim relating to the moneys in the Australian bank accounts. This argument ignores the different legal bases of the respective claims.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The basis of the appellant\u2019s claim to the moneys in the Australian bank accounts is the assertion that those were funds provided by the Testator. On the other hand, the success of the claims to the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties rests on the appellant demonstrating the Testator\u2019s interest, if any, in the other foreign properties before they were sold. This is because any interest which the Testator had in the said sale proceeds would have flowed from an interest in the other foreign properties. Therefore, in adjudicating on the claims to the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties, the court would necessarily have to consider the Testator\u2019s interest in those properties. This, in turn, raises the question of jurisdiction over those properties. We will therefore deal with the foreign immovable properties and the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties together.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The requirements for the assumption of equitable jurisdiction</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge held that the court could not assume equitable jurisdiction for two reasons. First, the dispute was not sufficiently connected to the forum so as to warrant equity\u2019s assistance. Second, the Judge commented, by way of <i>obiter dicta</i>, that it was also arguable that the appellant\u2019s equity had already been extinguished by the <i>lex situs</i>. We will consider these reasons in turn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Is a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum a prerequisite to the assumption of equitable jurisdiction?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In support of the proposition that a sufficient connection between the forum and the dispute was required before the court could assume equitable jurisdiction, the Judge relied (see the GD at [24]) on an extract from R\u00a0W\u00a0White\u2019s article, \u201cEquitable Obligations in Private International Law: The Choice of Law\u201d (1986) 11\u00a0Syd\u00a0LR 92 (\u201cWhite\u2019s article\u201d) at 106, which was cited at para\u00a01.18 of T\u00a0M\u00a0Yeo, <i>Choice of Law for Equitable Doctrines</i> (Oxford University Press, 2004) (\u201cYeo\u2019s book\u201d), the leading work in the field. The above extract from White\u2019s article reads as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A defendant could not reasonably be expected to conform to the principles of English equity if his connection with England were as tenuous as mere presence at the time of service. It seems that instead of applying choice of law rules to a dispute the Court insisted that there be a sufficient connection between the parties or the cause of action and England.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">This short extract from White\u2019s article does, at first blush, appear to suggest that, in England, the courts of equity would only assume jurisdiction where the dispute was sufficiently connected to the forum. With respect, however, this extract must be read in the context of White\u2019s article as a whole. When so read, it becomes clear that the learned author was referring in the extract set out in the preceding paragraph to the strict jurisdictional rules of the Court of Chancery which held sway in England <i>prior to</i> 1873. White sought to explain how these old jurisdictional rules also functioned as a <i>proxy</i> for choice of law analysis in the past. Put simply, the net result was a <i>conflation</i> of the rules of jurisdiction on the one hand and those relating to the choice of law on the other. The main issue before us in the present appeal is whether or not the old jurisdictional rules just referred to <i>continue to apply today.</i> The related issue as to whether or not there ought to be a conflation of jurisdictional rules and choice of law rules will (as we shall see) figure prominently when we consider the case law that was relied upon by the Judge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the former issue mentioned at the end of the preceding paragraph is concerned, White recognised \u2013 correctly, in our view \u2013 that, with the enactment of the Judicature Act 1873 (c\u00a066) (UK) (as well as subsequent developments), the strict jurisdictional rules applied by the Court of Chancery, which required a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum, were <i>abandoned</i>, there having been a fusion of the administration of justice by both the courts of common law and the Court of Chancery. The learned author explains this (very significant) development as follows (see White\u2019s article ([13] <i>supra</i>) at 104\u2013105):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">... The concept of jurisdiction applicable in the Court of Chancery was not based on mere presence and service, but upon a sufficient connection being shown between the dispute and the forum. That connection existed if the defendant were resident or domiciled in England, the cause of action arose there, or the subject matter of the dispute was situated there.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Court would not adjudicate upon foreign disputes not so connected with England. It was a natural refinement of this concept of jurisdiction that if it were inappropriate to decide the case in England and there was a competent tribunal to decide it in the natural foreign forum, the requisites of jurisdiction would be held to be lacking even though there was a connection with England (for example [the] defendant\u2019s residence in England) which in other cases would suffice to found jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery. The reluctance to deal with foreign disputes produced in <i>Doss v. Secretary of State for India</i> [(1874\u201375) LR\u00a019\u00a0Eq 509] a liberal doctrine of <i>forum conveniens</i> which was part of the concept of jurisdiction and which did not depend on a distinction between the existence of jurisdiction and the discretion to exercise it. <i>On the passing of the Judicature Act 1873 the principles on which the Court of Chancery and the Courts of Law exercised jurisdiction were different. The Judicature Act 1873 did not itself resolve this difference, but it would have been manifestly inconvenient if the English Court had exercised jurisdiction on principles which varied according to whether the cause of action was legal or equitable. The problem was resolved in favour of the common law principles without discussion.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Since the Judicature Act 1873 it has been uniformly held that mere presence suffices to found jurisdiction. None of the English cases has concerned an equitable cause of action. Nonetheless they have been decided in the belief that the principle of jurisdiction based on mere presence is a fundamental rule that applies to the entire jurisdiction of the English High Court.</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">...</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in England, <i>post</i>-1873, the jurisdiction of the courts of common law and that of the courts of equity were placed on an equal basis. Presence, submission or service of a writ or other originating process out of jurisdiction in accordance with the prevailing civil procedure rules was thenceforth sufficient for the courts to assume jurisdiction. <i>There was no longer any requirement that there had to be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before the court could assume equitable as well as common law jurisdiction.</i> This is also the position in Singapore today (see s\u00a016 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 2007\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d)).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once the court assumes equitable jurisdiction on any of the bases set out in s\u00a016 of the SCJA, it can act <i>in personam</i> against the defendant. The court can consider the personal equities exception and would (provided the exception is established on the facts before it) be free to issue an order which may indirectly affect foreign land. As has been observed in a leading textbook (see Sir\u00a0Peter North &amp; J\u00a0J\u00a0Fawcett, <i>Cheshire and North\u2019s Private International Law</i> (LexisNexis UK, 13th\u00a0Ed, 1999) at p\u00a0377):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The primary essential is that the defendant should be subject to the general jurisdiction of the court. This jurisdiction, as we have seen, is founded on his presence in England, but as regards the power to pronounce a decree in personam against him it is equally well founded by service of a claim form under Order\u00a011 [of the Rules of the Supreme Court (UK)]. Once the court is thus empowered to take cognizance of the matter, the doctrine that equity acts in personam may be freely and effectively applied. A decree may be issued which, though personal in form, will indirectly affect land abroad.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, with respect, the Judge was wrong to require that a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum be established before equitable jurisdiction could be assumed by the court. This represented the position taken by the Court of Chancery <i>prior to</i> 1873, which has long been <i>abandoned</i> even in England itself and which certainly does not represent the position in Singapore today.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should also deal with a related point which was referred to briefly above (at [14]) as this will (as we shall see) aid us in assessing the case law that was relied upon by the Judge in arriving at the conclusion that a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum was required before equitable jurisdiction could be assumed by the court. This point is that the Court of Chancery not only assumed jurisdiction according to a strict rule prior to 1873, but also did so (as White perceptively argues) as the result of a reluctance to apply <i>choice of law</i> rules to the dispute at hand (see White\u2019s article ([13] <i>supra</i>) at 106 and the extracts from Yeo\u2019s book ([13] <i>supra</i>) set out below). With respect, the Court of Chancery\u2019s stance no longer represents the modern approach under which issues of jurisdiction and issues of choice of law are treated by the courts as being conceptually as well as practically distinct. Indeed, as just alluded to, the failure to distinguish between these two distinct issues gives us a clue as to why the case law (in particular, the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Lightning v Lightning Electrical Contractors Limited</i> [1998] EWHC\u00a0Admin 431 (\u201c<i>Lightning</i>\u201d)) <i>appeared</i> to support the Judge\u2019s view that there had to be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before equitable jurisdiction could be assumed by the court. Before we turn our attention briefly to such case law, the following pertinent observation by Prof\u00a0Yeo should be noted (see Yeo\u2019s book at para\u00a01.19):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">While there may have been a historical link between jurisdiction and choice of law in the Chancery court, <i>in the modern context there is insufficient justification for linking jurisdiction and choice of law for equitable doctrines</i> \u2026 [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The learned author proceeded to give six persuasive reasons for the above observation, including the following (<i>id</i> at paras\u00a01.23 and 1.25):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1.23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... [T]he historical context is important. In tracing the historical development of English conflict of laws, Sack [A\u00a0N\u00a0Sack, \u201cConflict of Laws in the History of the English Law\u201d in <i>Law: A Century of Progress 1835\u22121935</i> (A\u00a0Reppy ed) (Oxford University Press, 1937) vol\u00a03 at p\u00a0342] noted the widespread use of jurisdiction as an early technique to limit the application of the law of the forum, <i>before</i> choice of law rules were developed. The <i>underdeveloped</i> rules for choice of law in respect of equitable doctrines must be borne in mind when considering the practice of the eighteenth-century courts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1.25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... [C]hanges of jurisdiction rules brought about by the Judicature Act 1873 put the jurisdiction of the courts of common law and equity <i>on an equal basis</i>. The broad bases upon which jurisdiction can be assumed today make application of the law of the forum even more unreasonable. Any slender links that existed between the Chancery court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction and the question of choice of law have <i>now been broken</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In this regard, we must respectfully disagree with the English High Court decision of <i>R\u00a0Griggs Group Ltd v Evans</i> [2005] Ch 153 in so far as it suggests (especially at [110]) that the personal equities exception to the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule is one which relates to choice of law instead of jurisdiction, although it might be argued that the learned judge in that case was involved <i>only</i> in a choice of law analysis (as opposed to the issue of jurisdiction).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning, now, to <i>Lightning</i>, the Judge, with respect, relied wrongly on this case as support for his view that there had to be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before the court could assume equitable jurisdiction. In <i>Lightning</i>, the court assumed equitable jurisdiction and applied English law to determine a trust claim to Scottish property. While the facts of that case disclosed, in <i>fact</i>, a close connection between the dispute and the forum, such a connection went only to the choice of law analysis and <i>not</i> to the issue of jurisdiction. The crucial passage in the judgment of Peter Gibson\u00a0LJ (with whom Henry and Millett\u00a0LJJ agreed) occurs at [23], and reads as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Lord [counsel for the defendant] said that these authorities [<i>ie</i>, the authorities considered at [18]\u2013[22] of <i>Lightning</i>] go only to the question of jurisdiction and do not go to the question of the applicable law. But, for my part, whilst that may be correct, it seems to me implicit that the English court not unnaturally regarded English law as applicable to the relationship between the parties before it in the absence of any event governed by the lex situs destructive of the equitable interest being asserted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We can, in fact, do no better than to adopt Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s perceptive observations on <i>Lightning</i> in general and the observations of Peter Gibson\u00a0LJ (<i>id</i> at [23]) in particular, as follows (see Yeo\u2019s book ([13] <i>supra</i>) at para 1.17):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Moreover, just because a court applied English law <b><i>after assuming jurisdiction</i></b> does not mean that it follows as a matter of law that English law was applicable. In <i>Lightning v Lightning Electrical Contractors Ltd</i>, Peter Gibson\u00a0LJ, said of the jurisdiction cases:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Counsel] said that these authorities go only to the question of jurisdiction and do not go to the question of the applicable law. But, \u2026 whilst that may be correct, it seems to me implicit that <i>the English court not unnaturally regarded English law as applicable to the relationship between the parties before it</i> in the absence of any event governed by the <i>lex situs</i> destructive of the equitable interest being asserted. (Emphasis added.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The emphasized words show <b><i>a separate choice of law analysis</i></b> focusing on the law governing the relationship of the parties, which usually happened to be English law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added in bold italics]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, this interpretation of <i>Lightning</i> underlies the analysis by another writer who argues that equitable obligations should not automatically be governed by the <i>lex fori</i> as such (see generally Adeline Chong, \u201cThe Common Law Choice of Law Rules for Resulting and Constructive Trusts\u201d (2005) 54\u00a0ICLQ 855 at 863\u2013866).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, the close connection between the dispute and the forum went only to the analysis of choice of law, and not jurisdiction, in <i>Lightning</i>. The same is true of <i>Webb v Webb</i> [1991] 1\u00a0WLR 1410, to which the Judge also referred. Consequently, the lack of a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum is not, in our view, a bar to the assumption of equitable <i>jurisdiction</i> by the court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Has the appellant\u2019s equity been extinguished by the</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">lex situs<em>?</em></span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we mentioned earlier (at [12] above), the Judge also observed, by way of <i>obiter dicta</i>, that it was arguable that the appellant\u2019s equity had already been extinguished by the <i>lex situs</i>. He was of the view that it was common ground between the parties that the communal property doctrine in Indonesian law was subject to the exception that spouses had full entitlement to properties acquired as gifts. The Judge thus observed that, if the first respondent had received the foreign properties as gifts, she would be fully entitled to those properties under Indonesian law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, we are unable to agree with these observations.</span> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">Even if the <i>lex situs</i> did apply for the purposes of determining whether the appellant\u2019s equity had been extinguished (which issue we need not decide), no evidence of Indonesian law was adduced in the court below to support the Judge\u2019s finding. The appellant also vehemently denied that it was common ground between the parties that, under Indonesian law, spouses were fully entitled to properties acquired as gifts. As such, although we recognise that the Judge\u2019s comments were strictly <i>obiter</i>, we find that there simply is no basis on the evidence to support these comments.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next issue that arises for our consideration is whether, although our courts do have jurisdiction over the Claims, we ought nevertheless to decline to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. We have previously stated that the relevant test in this regard is to determine whether there is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore which meets the ends of justice, having regard to the interests of the parties (see the decision of this court in <i>Murakami Takako</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>) at [49]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has been firmly established that the principles laid down in <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation\u00a0v Cansulex Ltd</i> [1987] AC 460 (\u201c<i>Spiliada</i>\u201d) apply (see, for example, the decisions of this court in <i>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT\u00a0Airfast Services Indonesia</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 776</nobr>, <i>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 253</nobr>, <i>PT\u00a0Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Limited</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 49</nobr>, <i>Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 377</nobr> (\u201c<i>Rickshaw</i>\u201d) at [12] and <i>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</i> <nobr>[2008] SGCA 36</nobr> (\u201c<i>CIMB</i>\u201d) at [25]). The principles set out in <i>Spiliada</i> were recently summarised in <i>CIMB</i> (at [26]) as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The gist of these principles is that, under the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, a stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden of establishing this rests on the defendant and it is not enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum. The defendant must also establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. The natural forum is one with which the action has the most real and substantial connection. In this regard, the factors which the court will take into consideration include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court concludes, at this stage of the inquiry (\u201cstage one of the <i>Spiliada</i> test\u201d), that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, at this stage, it concludes that there is some other available forum which <i>prima facie</i> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. In this connection, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case. For this second stage [of the] inquiry (\u201cstage two of the <i>Spiliada</i> test[\u201d]), the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of those special circumstances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the first stage of the analysis delineated in the above passage, the relevant factors are, <i>inter alia</i>, the general connecting factors and the choice of law (see <i>Rickshaw</i> at [15]). In the court below, the Judge was of the view that, as there was (in his view) a requirement that there be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before the court could assume equitable jurisdiction, the <i>lex fori</i> (here, Singapore law) ought to apply \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that the decision of this court in <i>Eng Liat Kiang</i> ([9] <i>supra</i>) appeared to be authority to the contrary (see the GD at [39]\u2013[40]). He nevertheless proceeded to hold that, in the light of the decision of this court in <i>Rickshaw</i>, the application of the <i>lex fori</i> in the context of the present proceedings would be unsuitable (see the GD at [41]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have, in fact, held above (at [18] and [22]) that there need not be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before the court can assume equitable jurisdiction. In any event, we have also held above (at [19]) that the issue of jurisdiction is separate and distinct from that relating to the choice of law. More importantly, as Prof\u00a0Yeo has very persuasively argued, the court can still proceed to engage in a choice of law analysis and apply a law other than the <i>lex fori</i> even after it has assumed equitable jurisdiction. We have previously endorsed Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s view in <i>Rickshaw</i>, as follows (<i>id</i> at [75]\u2013[76]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note, at the outset, that the principles relating to choice of law with regard to claims in equity are not entirely clear. We are therefore especially grateful to have the benefit of the views of the leading expert in the field in Singapore (and, indeed, the Commonwealth) as embodied in a very scholarly volume which, if we may say so, has justly received widespread praise: see T\u00a0M\u00a0Yeo, <i>Choice of Law for Equitable Doctrines</i> (Oxford University Press, 2004) (\u201c<i>Yeo</i>\u201d). Indeed, this is the seminal work in the field in the Commonwealth and is based on the author\u2019s doctoral thesis completed at Oxford University (a summary of his main theses can be found in Tiong Min Yeo, \u201cChoice of Law for Equity\u201d in ch\u00a07 of <i>Equity in Commercial Law</i> (Simone Degeling &amp; James Edelman eds) (Law Book Co, 2005)). There is in fact little by way of direct authority in this particular area of the law and the learned author does rely much on first principles. His views are therefore especially valuable in the circumstances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It used to be thought that the <i>lex causae</i> for claims in equity would generally be the <i>lex fori</i> (in these proceedings, Singapore law). The central insight of Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s book (referred to in the preceding paragraph) is the suggestion of a more nuanced approach. Put simply, there would not, <i>ipso facto</i>, be an automatic and blanket application of the <i>lex fori</i> in any and every situation of this nature. Instead, the nature and origins of the equitable obligations concerned would need to be closely examined in the context of their respective factual matrices. In our view, such an approach is undoubtedly sound. The adoption of the <i>lex fori</i> as the <i>lex causae</i> for <i>all</i> issues arising in equity would fail to recognise the disparate doctrines and causes of action arising in equity. Such an approach would be no different from a suggestion that all common law claims, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, should be governed by the <i>lex fori</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We also noted above (at [27]) that the Judge had, in any event, followed the above approach in <i>Rickshaw</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In these proceedings, the viability or otherwise of the Claims ultimately rests on whether or not the Testator had an interest in the foreign immovable properties as well as the other foreign properties (collectively referred to as \u201cthe disputed foreign properties\u201d), and this falls to be determined by the Testator\u2019s <i>lex domicilii</i>, which was Indonesian law. The question that arises for our consideration then is whether, given that the <i>lex causae</i> is Indonesian law, Indonesia is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore for the adjudication of the Claims.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant\u2019s claim that the Testator had an interest in the entire share of the disputed foreign properties requires the court to consider whether, under Indonesian law, those properties were excepted from being regarded as common marital assets such that the Testator had full entitlement to them. The matter is further complicated by the first respondent\u2019s counter-allegation that, on the contrary, she was fully entitled to the disputed foreign properties as gifts. These are issues which require a careful consideration of the scope of the communal property doctrine in Indonesian law. In addition, the appellant has also alleged a failure on the part of the first respondent to disclose to the Indonesian courts the disputed foreign properties as marital assets. The effect of such non-disclosure may or may not bring with it certain legal consequences under Indonesian law. In sum, the complexities raised by the Claims are, in our view, better dealt with by the Indonesian courts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are also other general connecting factors pointing to Indonesia as the clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum. Both the Testator and the first respondent were resident and married in Indonesia, and the present dispute arose out of ancillary proceedings in a divorce action commenced there as well. Further, the appellant had previously brought a claim relating to those of the disputed foreign properties situated in Indonesia (\u201cthe Indonesian properties\u201d) before the South Jakarta District Court. Her prior claim was dismissed merely on the ground of procedural defects (see <i>Takako Murakami v Louise Maria Wiryadi</i> Judgment No\u00a0924/Pdt.G/2006/PN.Jak.Sel. (3\u00a0October 2007) (unreported)). In particular, she failed to include, as parties to the action, the third parties in whose names the Indonesian properties were registered. Since the appellant\u2019s claim to the Indonesian properties has yet to be adjudicated on its merits, the appellant is not precluded from bringing another claim in Indonesia to those properties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as those of the disputed foreign properties situated in Australia (\u201cthe Australian properties\u201d) are concerned, the appellant also previously brought claims in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Gzell\u00a0J, in <i>Murakami v Wiryadi</i> <nobr>[2006] NSWSC 1354</nobr> (\u201c<i>Murakami</i>\u201d), stayed those proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. The learned judge applied the Australian approach to <i>forum non conveniens</i> as set out in the Australian High Court decisions of <i>Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay</i> (1988) 165\u00a0CLR 197 (\u201c<i>Oceanic Sun Line</i>\u201d), <i>Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited</i> (1990) 171\u00a0CLR 538 (\u201c<i>Voth</i>\u201d), <i>Henry v Henry</i> (1996) 185\u00a0CLR 571 and <i>CSR Limited v Cigna Insurance Australia Limited</i> (1997) 189\u00a0CLR 345 to the effect that the court may stay or dismiss proceedings if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the availability of the foreign tribunal, the forum is clearly inappropriate for the determination of the dispute (reference may similarly be made to the (also) Australian High Court decision of <i>Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang</i> (2002) 210\u00a0CLR 491).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the test applied in the Australian context to the issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is quite different from that set out in <i>Spiliada</i> ([26] <i>supra</i>), there would (on most occasions) be no difference in the actual result arrived at by the court (see, for example, <i>Oceanic Sun Line</i> at 251\u2013252 (<i>per</i> Deane\u00a0J) and 265\u2013266 (<i>per</i> Gaudron\u00a0J), <i>Voth</i> at 558 (<i>per</i> Mason\u00a0CJ and Deane, Dawson and Gaudron\u00a0JJ), <i>Eng Liat Kiang</i> ([9] <i>supra</i>) at 104, [23] and Peter Brereton, \u201c<i>Forum Non Conveniens</i> in Australia: A Case Note on <i>Voth</i> v. <i>Manildra Flour Mills</i>\u201d (1991) 40\u00a0ICLQ 895 at 897\u2013898; <i>cf</i>, however, <i>Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments</i> ([6] <i>supra</i>) at para\u00a04.20 (reference may also be made to Richard Garnett, \u201cStay of Proceedings in Australia: A \u2018Clearly Inappropriate\u2019 Test?\u201d (1999) 23\u00a0Melb\u00a0Univ\u00a0L\u00a0Rev 30)). That having been said, it is important to guard against simply equating the two tests because (if nothing else) their respective points of emphasis are quite different (see, for example, <i>Voth</i> at 558 <i>per</i> Mason\u00a0CJ and Deane, Dawson and Gaudron\u00a0JJ; the learned judges, however, also observed that, in applying the test under Australian law, \u201cthe discussion by Lord\u00a0Goff in <i>Spiliada</i> of relevant \u2018connecting factors\u2019 and \u2018a legitimate personal or juridical advantage\u2019 provide[d] valuable assistance\u201d (<i>id</i> at 564\u2013565) \u2013 observations which were also cited and applied by Gzell\u00a0J in <i>Murakami</i> at [39]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While we have previously rejected the Australian approach to <i>forum non conveniens</i> in favour of the test in <i>Spiliada</i>, which calls for a determination of whether there is another forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore (see, for example, the decision of this court in <i>Eng Liat Kiang</i> at 105, [26]), Gzell\u00a0J\u2019s observations in <i>Murakami</i> ([32] <i>supra</i>) are nevertheless helpful. This is because the factors which the learned judge considered would apply with equal force in the context of the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> as set out in <i>Spiliada</i>. In particular, Gzell\u00a0J noted that (see <i>Murakami</i> at [45]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The connecting factors ... do not favour New South Wales against Indonesia. [The appellant] is not resident in New South Wales and [the first respondent] and [the fourth respondent] do not live in Australia. The events [which are] the subject of complaint are just as much centred in Indonesia where the non-disclosure of the New South Wales assets is alleged to have occurred as in New South Wales where the assets were acquired.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The learned judge also noted (<i>id</i> at [46]), just as we have (see [29] above), that the <i>lex causae</i> was Indonesian law. He further commented (at [47] of <i>Murakami</i>) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If matters are to be determined in the New South Wales court expert evidence will be required. If the issues are to be determined in the Indonesian courts there is no need for experts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, Gzell\u00a0J was of the view (<i>id</i> at [52]) that \u201cit [was] in the interests of the parties that a proper resolution of the issues be made in proceedings to be commenced in Indonesia\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The factors and the arguments considered by Gzell\u00a0J in the preceding paragraph, although analysed in the context of the Australian approach to <i>forum non conveniens</i>, apply equally in the context of the approach of this court as embodied in <i>Spiliada</i> ([26] <i>supra</i>). Indeed, there is a considerable overlap between the factors and the arguments considered by Gzell\u00a0J in <i>Murakami</i> and those discussed above in the context of the present proceedings. There is, in fact, good reason to believe that this is one instance where there would be no difference in result regardless of whether the Australian approach or the approach in <i>Spiliada</i> is adopted (see also above at [33]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the point of enforceability of judgments, we also note that, if indeed the appellant obtains a favourable judgment in Indonesia, the judgment would undoubtedly be enforceable with regard to the Indonesian properties. As for the Australian properties, an Indonesian judgment is also likely to be enforceable in Australia, given Gzell\u00a0J\u2019s recognition that it is appropriate for the Indonesian courts to address the appellant\u2019s claim. These are important practical considerations which we cannot ignore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, the general connecting factors and the choice of law considerations point to Indonesia as constituting the clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum (as compared to Singapore) for the trial of the issues concerned. For that reason, although our courts have jurisdiction over the Claims, we should not exercise jurisdiction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based, therefore, on the conclusion which we have arrived at with regard to the issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, we dismiss the appeal with costs and affirm the Judge\u2019s decision to disallow the appellant\u2019s application to include the Claims in her statement of claim.

We heard the appeal and, not being persuaded that the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) was wrong in the exercise of his discretion or had misapplied the relevant principles, dismissed it. We now give our reasons.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dresdner is a foreign company with a registered office in England offering banking services, including the discounting of promissory notes. Its London branch (\u201cDresdner London\u201d) was the office that dealt with the purported transaction involving the Notes. CIMB is a Malaysian bank with branches in various places, including London and Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 6\u00a0May 2002, pursuant to a written agreement, Dresdner sought to purchase from CIMB the Notes,</span><a id=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 1]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">which had a nominal value of US$10m, for the amount of the Funds. The Notes, with a maturity date of 3\u00a0February 2004, were issued on 1\u00a0February 2002 by Innaria Sdn Bhd, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia (\u201cInnaria\u201d) to the order of V\u00a0V\u00a0Enterprise, Luyang, Sabah, Malaysia (\u201cV\u00a0V\u00a0Enterprise\u201d), and payable at Maybank Bhd, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. The Notes bore signatures that appeared to be those of two directors of Innaria, namely, Lye Kok Keng alias Harry (\u201cLye\u201d) and Mohamed Zulfikar bin Muzaffar (\u201cZulfikar\u201d). The Notes on their face also bore the guarantee of the Public Works Department of Sabah, Malaysia, with the alleged signatures of John Baptist Badai (\u201cBadai\u201d) and Lontou Ujum (\u201cUjum\u201d) against the signed stamp of a \u201cCommissioner for Oaths\u201d. The Notes were accompanied by a confirmation letter from Innaria stating <span class=\"Judg-1Char\">that the Notes \u201crelate to the financing of the import and installation of pipes under contract number JKR.JLN (S)\u00a0600 \u2013 1/5/6 Klt.16/144\u201d.</span></span><a id=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 2]</span></span></span></span></a><span class=\"Judg-1Char\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As with the Notes, this confirmation letter bore the signatures of Lye and Zulfikar of Innaria and those of Badai and Ujum of the Public Works Department of Sabah.

In the SWIFT communication there was an express instruction that the Funds be credited to CIMB Inanam as the beneficial customer. The next day, CIMB Singapore transferred the Funds over to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Hong Kong (\u201cHSBC Hong Kong\u201d) in favour of New Speed Technologies Ltd, pursuant to what appeared to be instructions issued by George Chau and Ahmad Bin HJ\u00a0Khamis of CIMB Inanam for the attention of Paul Ma, the assistant general manager of CIMB Singapore.</span><a id=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 4]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">That notification stated that CIMB Inanam had received such instructions from V\u00a0V\u00a0Enterprise. Before the Funds were remitted to Hong Kong, the general manager of CIMB Singapore, Raja Sulong Razak (\u201cRazak\u201d), confirmed with CIMB Inanam that the transfer should proceed.</span><a id=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 5]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Upon payment, Dresdner London obtained the Notes from the London branch of CIMB (\u201cCIMB London\u201d) and endorsed them over to DF Deutsche Forfait AG (\u201cDF\u201d). It also warranted to DF as to the legal existence of the Notes and the avals contained therein. Subsequently, DF resold the Notes to Siemens Financial Services GmbH (\u201cSFS\u201d) and similarly assigned the warranty over to SFS.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We pause here to mention that this series of transactions involving the Notes were brokered by an English company, Bon Pour Aval Limited (\u201cBPAL\u201d). Eventually, the Notes were dishonoured upon presentation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 9\u00a0November 2005, SFS sued Dresdner in Munich, Germany, on the warranty and on 18\u00a0August 2006 obtained a German judgment. Dresdner has filed an appeal against that decision and the determination of that appeal is now pending before the Superior Regional Court of Munich. We should hasten to add that there are further levels of appeal beyond the Superior Regional Court. The entire judicial process before the German courts is not likely to conclude before the end of 2009.</span><a id=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 6]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated earlier, the written agreement was executed on behalf of CIMB by George Chau. CIMB alleged that the agreement could not bind CIMB, and thus it was of no validity, because George Chau, acting alone, had no authority to execute the agreement. Moreover, the limit of George Chau\u2019s authority was expressly communicated to Dresdner by way of a fax dated 21\u00a0May 2002 from Ms\u00a0Andrea Francis (\u201cMs\u00a0Francis\u201d), a trade finance officer of CIMB London, to Ms\u00a0Amanda Callaghan (\u201cMs\u00a0Callaghan\u201d) of Dresdner London, which stated that two authorised signatories were required for the endorsement of promissory notes that exceeded US$10,000.</span><a id=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 7]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Here we should explain that earlier, on 15\u00a0May 2002, Yussof Bin Momin (\u201cMomin\u201d), a customer officer of CIMB Inanam, faxed a message to Ms\u00a0Callaghan confirming that George Chau was authorised to sign on behalf of CIMB and that his sole signature was sufficient and legally binding on CIMB in relation to the Notes.</span><a id=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 8]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">On\u00a020 May 2002, Ms\u00a0Callaghan wrote to Ms\u00a0Francis seeking confirmation that Momin had authority to act on behalf of CIMB and to issue the fax of 15\u00a0May 2002. On 21\u00a0May 2002, the Head of Customer Service of CIMB Inanam, Ms\u00a0Linda Sia Henry Sum (\u201cMs\u00a0Sum\u201d), and Momin jointly faxed a message to CIMB London and copied it to Ms\u00a0Callaghan, confirming that one signatory was sufficient for the transaction of the Notes and that George Chau was so authorised. Again Ms\u00a0Callaghan immediately sought confirmation of this 21\u00a0May 2002 fax from Ms\u00a0Francis. Later, on the same day, CIMB Inanam sent a fax to CIMB London for the attention of Ms\u00a0Francis asking her to confirm to Ms\u00a0Callaghan that Momin and Ms\u00a0Sum were legal and authorised signatories of CIMB Inanam. This led to Ms\u00a0Francis\u2019 fax of the same day stating that George Chau\u2019s sole signature was valid only for transactions up to US$10,000 and two signatories were required for transactions beyond that limit.</span><a id=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 9]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">On 23\u00a0May 2002, Ms\u00a0Mastulu Nurdin (\u201cMs\u00a0Nurdin\u201d), the Operations Manager of CIMB London, asked CIMB\u2019s headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (\u201cCIMB\u00a0KL\u201d) to verify the transaction for security purposes.</span><a id=\"_ftnref10\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 10]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Of course, this latter note was not communicated to Dresdner.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the Notes were dishonoured, an internal investigation was carried out by CIMB which came to the conclusion that \u201cthe Project was non-existent, the supporting documents to validate the issuance of the Notes were fictitious and the Notes were issued in furtherance of a fraud\u201d.</span><a id=\"_ftnref11\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 11]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the statement of claim in the present action, Dresdner averred that the agreement with CIMB relating to the purchase and sale of the Notes was valid. This was also Dresdner\u2019s position in the German proceedings. Further, Dresdner pleaded in the alternative that if the agreement were in fact not valid and binding, it was entitled to reclaim the money from CIMB on the ground that the money was paid under a mistake of fact and that, consequently, CIMB had been unjustly enriched. A second alternative basis of Dresdner\u2019s claim was that the payment was made pursuant to a consideration which had totally failed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now explain why Dresdner had applied for a temporary stay of the present action. In view of the pending German proceedings, Dresdner took the position that if it could successfully resist the claim by SFS, then it, having suffered no loss, would not have to continue with its claim against CIMB. Indeed the institution of the present action in Singapore against CIMB was entirely precautionary as otherwise limitation would have set in on 6\u00a0June 2008.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to Dresdner\u2019s application for a temporary stay, CIMB applied to have the present action permanently stayed on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, asserting that England was the more appropriate forum to adjudicate on the dispute between them because much of the negotiations relating to the purported sale and purchase of the Notes were conducted by staff of the London offices of the two parties. The defence of CIMB, as disclosed in its affidavits filed in support of its stay application, was that the \u201cagreement\u201d signed by George Chau was not valid or binding. It also alleged that it had changed its position in good faith, <i>ie</i>, it had, in good faith, remitted the Funds received from Dresdner to HSBC Hong Kong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Decisions below</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before the assistant registrar it was decided that Dresdner\u2019s application for a temporary stay should be heard prior to CIMB\u2019s application. Having ruled in that manner, the assistant registrar granted Dresdner\u2019s application and did not proceed to hear CIMB\u2019s application. On appeal, the Judge decided that both applications should be heard together. At the hearing before the Judge, in order to ensure that Dresdner would not subsequently revive the validity of the agreement as an issue, Dresdner gave an undertaking (\u201cthe Undertaking\u201d) that, for the purposes of this action, it would not take the position that the agreement was valid (see the Judge\u2019s grounds of decision (\u201cthe GD\u201d) in <i>Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd v CIMB Bank Bhd</i> <nobr>[2008] SGHC 59</nobr> at [136]\u2013[140]). The effect of the Undertaking was that Dresdner agreed with CIMB that George Chau had entered into the agreement without authority and that there was no such agreement.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, the Judge dismissed CIMB\u2019s application for a permanent stay and varied the temporary stay granted by the assistant registrar in that CIMB was granted liberty to take all essential steps for it to commence any intended third-party proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Factors taken into account by the Judge</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In considering the question of whether England was the more appropriate forum to adjudicate on the present action, the Judge examined the following factors which CIMB averred connected the present action with England:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the agreement was valid and enforceable;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the potential witnesses which both parties were likely to call in relation to the claim for unjust enrichment;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> whether Dresdner London made the payment as a result of a mistake; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the change of position of CIMB upon receipt of the payment and the involvement of its Singapore branch.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CIMB also underscored the fact that the London offices of both Dresdner and CIMB were more closely involved with the transaction than its Singapore office which merely received the payment and transferred it out to HSBC Hong Kong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge also considered the following issues or factors which, as alleged by Dresdner, connected the present action with Singapore:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether there was a failure of consideration for the payment of the Funds if the agreement was not valid;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether, in making the payment, Dresdner laboured under a mistake that the agreement was valid and binding;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether CIMB changed its position after receiving the payment;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether, in changing its position, CIMB acted in good faith;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the question of unjust enrichment and the proper law of the restitutionary obligations; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the question of third-party actions which CIMB intended to institute against HSBC Hong Kong and BPAL.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It would be apparent that some of these factors raised by Dresdner overlapped with those raised by CIMB.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to factors\u00a0(a), (b) and (c) (at [14] above), the Judge recognised that, in view of the fact that the negotiations leading to the purported agreement as well as the verification of the Notes and authorised signatories were carried out mainly by employees of both parties in London, the witnesses involved would be in London and so would the relevant documents. Thus these factors favoured London. However, the Judge also commented that as the potential witnesses of CIMB were still in its employment, there should not be too much difficulty in getting them to come over to Singapore to testify. Moreover, the relevant documents were also small in number.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for factor\u00a0(d) (at [14] above), the Judge noted that the Funds were received by CIMB Singapore which remitted them to HSBC Hong Kong in contravention of the express instructions contained in the SWIFT message (see [4] above). As regards CIMB\u2019s contentions that the broker, BPAL, could also have played a role in the remittance of the Funds to Hong Kong, that CIMB intended to take out third-party proceedings against BPAL and that consequently BPAL directors and staff, who were located in London, would be necessary witnesses, the Judge observed that in the light of the fact that there was reciprocal enforcement of judgments between Singapore and the United Kingdom, CIMB could bring third-party proceedings here against BPAL and he could not imagine that BPAL would ignore the third-party action so taken out here.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On factor\u00a0(a) (at [16] above), the Judge was of the view that that was primarily a question of law. As for factor\u00a0(b) (at [16] above), he observed that only Ms\u00a0Francis and George Chau of CIMB communicated with Ms\u00a0Callaghan of Dresdner London in relation to the payment. Therefore, only these three persons would really be able to shed any light on the issue of payment. Ms\u00a0Francis was still in the employment of CIMB so there should be no difficulty in getting her to come over to Singapore to testify; it was only a matter of some expense which was well within the means of CIMB. In his view, this was not a significant factor. George Chau had left CIMB\u2019s employment and his whereabouts were not known. The Judge rejected CIMB\u2019s argument that it would not be able to call the people from BPAL to be witnesses unless the trial was in London because, in his opinion, it was \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d for CIMB to expect that the employees of BPAL would testify on its behalf given that it intended to take third-party action against BPAL (see the GD at [68]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On factors\u00a0(c) and (d) (at [16] above), the Judge stated that the event of CIMB\u2019s change of position upon receiving the Funds occurred in Singapore. But he also noted that what took place at CIMB Inanam was also material as it was that branch which purportedly gave the instructions to the Singapore branch to transfer the payment to Hong Kong in favour of another party, New Speed Technologies Ltd. As for the question of good faith in the remittance of the Funds from CIMB Singapore to Hong Kong, the evidence on that would depend on those same witnesses. If there was anyone who aided George Chau in the scam, it would likely be someone at CIMB Singapore. Two crucial witnesses of CIMB in this regard would be George Chau and Paul Ma, both of whom had ceased to be in the employment of CIMB and whose whereabouts were unknown. But the last-known address of Paul Ma was in Singapore and that of George Chau was in Malaysia. The Judge observed that, in any event, the relevant evidence in this connection was to be found in Singapore and Malaysia, not England.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this juncture, we would refer to the remarks of the Judge on the general question of the location of the witnesses (at [82] of the GD):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Dresdner] took pains during the hearing to impress upon me that it will facilitate the attendance of its London witnesses before the Singapore court, if the permanent stay application is not granted. Similarly, [CIMB] informed me that it will facilitate the attendance of its Singapore and Malaysian witnesses before the English court, if the action were stayed. As some of these potential witnesses are located in England and others in Singapore and Malaysia, I will not regard the convenience and cost factor to be weighing distinctly in favour either of Singapore or England for the trial. It is a fairly neutral factor in my judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for factor\u00a0(e) (at [16] above), in view of the position taken by Dresdner as evidenced by the Undertaking (see [12] above), the Judge came to the conclusion that there was, in truth, no contract in existence between the parties. This was not a case of a failed contract, <i>ie</i>, it was not a case where the parties had entered into a contractual relationship which failed. Effectively, it was a case of George Chau having perpetrated a fraud on both CIMB and Dresdner. In the circumstances, the Judge held that there was no prior relationship to which reference might be made or which might contribute to the identification of the proper law of the obligation to make restitution. The choice of law stated in the purported contract could not be relevant to the determination of the proper law that should govern the restoration of the alleged unjust enrichment. The obligation to make restitution would be governed by the law of the country with which the obligation to make restitution had the closest and most real connection. On this test, and taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the Judge concluded that the place with the closest and most real connection with the obligation to restore the benefit of the alleged enrichment was Singapore and not England.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning to factor\u00a0(f) (at [16] above), the evidence suggested that CIMB was likely to make claims against HSBC Hong Kong and BPAL. On the claim against HSBC Hong Kong, the Judge noted that the governing law was likely to be Hong Kong or Singapore. It would certainly have nothing to do with England. As for the claim against BPAL, that claim would be either for negligence or breach of duty in respect of BPAL\u2019s failure to conduct due diligence on Innaria and the underlying project for which the Notes were issued, or for conspiracy, or both. Thus, the claim which CIMB was likely to bring against BPAL would be quite different, and indeed very wide-ranging, from the rather straightforward claim of unjust enrichment which Dresdner was making against CIMB. To link CIMB\u2019s claim against BPAL with the present action by Dresdner against CIMB would unnecessarily prolong the trial of the present action. The Judge accepted that if the nature of the third-party proceedings were to fall within the scope of O\u00a016 r\u00a01 of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2006\u00a0Rev Ed), it was generally convenient that all the proceedings should be tried in the same forum. However, without knowing the full facts of the third-party claim and the likely responses of BPAL, the Judge was inclined to the view, in a tentative way, that it was probably more appropriate to try the claim in England after the Singapore action had been disposed of. Therefore, the Judge gave very little weight to the third-party claim which CIMB would be making against BPAL.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, the Judge concluded that CIMB had not shown that London was the more appropriate forum to adjudicate on the present unjust enrichment claim by Dresdner against CIMB because (see the GD at [143]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CIMB\u2019s unjust enrichment occurred in Singapore;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dresdner\u2019s causes of action principally for restitution, payment under a mistake and for money had and received arose in Singapore;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CIMB\u2019s alleged change of position occurred in Singapore;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CIMB\u2019s state of mind, if and when it changed its position would, <i>inter alia</i>, be that of its employees in its Singapore branch.

Those principles have been adopted by this court in several cases such as <i>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast Services Indonesia</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 776</nobr>, <i>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 97</nobr>, <i>PT\u00a0Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises</i> (<i>Holdings</i>) <i>Limited</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 49</nobr> and <i>Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 377</nobr> (\u201c<i>Rickshaw Investments</i>\u201d).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The gist of these principles is that, under the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, a stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden of establishing this rests on the defendant and it is not enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum. The defendant must also establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. The natural forum is one with which the action has the most real and substantial connection. In this regard, the factors which the court will take into consideration include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court concludes, at this stage of the inquiry (\u201cstage one of the <i>Spiliada</i> test\u201d), that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, at this stage, it concludes that there is some other available forum which <i>prima facie</i> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. In this connection, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case. For this second stage inquiry (\u201cstage two of the <i>Spiliada</i> test), the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of those special circumstances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Application of the <i>Spiliada</i> test to this appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Relevant factors at stage one of the</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Spiliada <em>test</em></span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As in the court below, CIMB argued that the present action had the closest connection with England as the negotiations for the sale and purchase of the Notes were carried out by the staff of both parties from their London offices and thus the relevant witnesses would all be there. On the other hand, Dresdner contended that, as its claim was only for unjust enrichment, Singapore was the natural forum for the action and that CIMB had not established that England was the more appropriate forum for the action. Three main factors were canvassed before us by the parties:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the applicable law in relation to Dresdner\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the country where the witnesses of the parties and the relevant documents were located; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 third-party actions which CIMB intended to institute and whether they should be tried together with the present action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should, in this regard, add that CIMB also made the allegation that Dresdner did not make a mistake when it remitted the Funds to CIMB Singapore and sought to rely on the fact that Dresdner London was informed on 21\u00a0May 2002 that any transactions beyond the value of US$10,000 would require two signatories (see [7] above). To our mind, to suggest that Dresdner made the payment knowing full well and being conscious that the agreement to effect the transaction was invalid, or of no effect, was simply absurd. Someone in Dresdner obviously bungled, having overlooked the notification received from CIMB London. However, an oversight is no less a mistake. There was no suggestion by CIMB that any employee in Dresdner was acting in cahoots with George Chau. In our opinion, this was a non-issue. It seemed to us that this point was made to enable CIMB to assert that employees of both Dresdner London and CIMB London would be required to be called as witnesses with the hope that this, in turn, could tilt the balance in the consideration of the factors germane to the <i>forum non conveniens</i> issue.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Issue of applicable law</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The basic rule is that a contract is governed by the law chosen by the parties: see <i>James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd v Whitworth Street Estates</i> (<i>Manchester</i>) <i>Ltd</i> [1970] AC\u00a0583 at 603 <i>per</i> Lord Reid, and Rule\u00a0203(1) in <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th\u00a0Ed, 2006) (\u201c<i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i>\u201d) at para\u00a032R\u2011061. In relation to the present matter, it could not be disputed that Dresdner had sought to enter into a contract with CIMB to purchase the Notes and in that \u201cagreement\u201d there was a provision, cl\u00a06.5, expressly stating that the applicable law would be the law of England and that the parties would submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. However, the claim, that the \u201cagreement\u201d was not valid and binding on CIMB because the person who allegedly entered into the \u201cagreement\u201d on behalf of CIMB had no authority to do so, put a different complexion to this question. In fact, CIMB also highlighted the fact that after the signing of the \u201cagreement\u201d, it had notified Dresdner that any transaction above the sum of US$10,000 would require two signatories. Be that as it may, with Dresdner eventually accepting (in the Undertaking) CIMB\u2019s assertion that George Chau had no authority to enter into the \u201cagreement\u201d, the effect would be that there was no contract between the parties under which the payment could have been made by Dresdner. Thus, the question which confronted this court was whether the applicable law clause in the void or non-existent \u201cagreement\u201d could conceivably apply to the present claim by Dresdner against CIMB for the return of the Funds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our opinion, a distinction ought to be drawn between a case where the parties are agreed that there is no agreement at all, and a case where the parties are in dispute as to the existence or validity of the agreement (<i>eg</i>, due to fraud or misrepresentation). It is settled principle that, in the latter situation, the dispute as to the existence or the validity of the contract would be construed in accordance with the law that governs that contract as if the contract were valid: see <i>The Parouth</i> [1982] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 351 at 353 <i>per</i> Ackner\u00a0LJ, and Rules\u00a0203 and 206 of <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> (at paras\u00a032R\u2011061 and 32R\u2011154 respectively). Such a rule makes good practical sense because otherwise it would mean that a mere allegation on the part of the defendant that there was fraud would suffice to neutralise the effect of the jurisdiction or choice of law clause in the agreement. In <i>Ash v Corporation of Lloyd</i>\u2019<i>s</i> (1992) 9\u00a0OR\u00a0(3d) 755 (\u201c<i>Ash</i>\u201d), Carthy\u00a0JA said (at 758):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The plaintiffs argue that the exclusive jurisdiction clauses should be ignored because if there has been fraud in the circumstances surrounding the procurement of the contracts then the contracts are void <i>ab initio</i> and the clauses relating to forum are of no effect. I agree with McKeown\u00a0J., and with the authorities he cites, to the effect that an allegation that a contract is void <i>ab initio</i> does not make it so until a final judgment of the court. If the plaintiffs can commence an action with an allegation of fraud which would void the contract and thus vitiate a choice of jurisdiction clause from the outset, then they may succeed on the merits while enjoying their own choice of jurisdiction or fail on the merits while depriving the defendant of the contracted choice. These clauses are too important in international commerce to permit that anomalous result to flow.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(1) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rule\u00a0230 of</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Dicey, Morris and Collins</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> states in Rule\u00a0230 as follows (at para\u00a034R\u2011001):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The obligation to restore the benefit of an enrichment obtained at another person\u2019s expense is governed by the proper law of the obligation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proper law of the obligation is (<i>semble</i>) determined as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the obligation arises in connection with a contract, its proper law is the law applicable to the contract;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If it arises in connection with a transaction concerning an immovable (land), its proper law is the law of the country where the immovable is situated (<i>lex situs</i>);</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If it arises in any other circumstances, its proper law is the law of the country where the enrichment occurs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In stating the principles in the three clauses of Rule\u00a0230(2), <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> seems to have applied the \u201cmost closely connected\u201d test. The issue that concerned us was whether Dresdner\u2019s present claim against CIMB came under cl\u00a02(a) or 2(c) of Rule\u00a0230. This, in turn, depended upon whether the alleged obligation to refund the payment arose \u201cin connection with a contract\u201d.

Alternatively, it may refer to situations where there is, or was, an underlying contractual relationship between the parties. Furthermore, the word \u201ccontract\u201d in this context could mean a wide variety of things. It could refer to an existing contract, a previously valid contract which has been discharged or avoided, or it could even include purported contracts which were never effective.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, extensive debate has occurred as to whether it is logically justifiable to use the law of a failed \u201ccontract\u201d to determine the restitutionary consequences of its failure. If a contract is void, how can it have a governing law and how can one justify extending the ambit of that governing law to an unjust enrichment claim? One answer is that perhaps it is convenient and pragmatic to adopt that rule and, arguably, such an approach was probably in line with the expectation of the parties. This approach seems to be premised on the assumption that the choice of law clause can be regarded as separable from the contract itself. If the law applicable to a contract determines that it is void, it is not obviously desirable, or commercially sensible, for a different law then to be applied to determine the restitutionary consequences of this voidness (see discussion in Jonathan Harris, \u201cDoes Choice of Law Make Any Sense?\u201d (2004) 57\u00a0CLP\u00a0305 at 327).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the commentary on cl\u00a02(a), <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> gives the following illustrations as to the sort of situations to which the clause applies (at paras\u00a034\u2011020 and 34\u2011021):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Although the obligation to restore an unjust benefit does not arise <i>from</i> a contract, it may, and very frequently does, arise in connection with a contract. This is the case where a party seeks to recover money paid pursuant to an <i>ineffective</i> contract, e.g. by reason of a failure of consideration or as a repayment of money paid under an illegal contract or where he claims a <i>quantum meruit</i> for work done or services rendered under a contract which turned out to be void. \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 [T]he choice of law rule for dealing with the consequences of a contract being void, or being avoided, or being discharged for frustration, will be the law which governed the real or supposed contract and pursuant to which the avoidance or discharge was brought about.

If the parties have expressly chosen the law to govern the contract, it is realistic to suppose that, had they given the matter any thought, they will have expected this law also to deal with the remedial consequences if the contract is ineffective or has failed. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will, at this juncture, examine some of the cases upon which <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> relied to state the principles in cl\u00a02(a) and to make the commentary quoted at [34] above. In <i>Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour, Limited</i> [1943] AC\u00a032, where a contract between an English company and a Polish company to sell and deliver goods in Poland was frustrated by the German occupation of Poland, the House of Lords held that the part payment made in advance could be recovered by way of restitution or quasi-contract. It is important to note that, in this case, the parties did not dispute that English law was the proper law to apply in relation to the claim for a refund of the part payment. Furthermore, what we would underscore about the case is that there was a contract, a meeting of the minds, between the parties. Payment was made thereunder. The contract was frustrated because of the war.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, in <i>Etler v Kertesz</i> (1960) 26\u00a0DLR\u00a0(2d) 209, there was a claim for the refund of a payment made under a contract governed by Austrian law but the contract was illegal by that law. The Ontario Court of Appeal held that the claim would be subject to Austrian law. Again, we would emphasise that there was a meeting of the minds as far as the contract was concerned. There was an intention on the part of both parties in <i>Etler v Kertesz</i> to enter into the contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast, in <i>Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim</i> [1993] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 543 (\u201c<i>Hashim</i>\u201d), an employer brought a claim to recover sums of money received by an employee as bribes. While Evans\u00a0J (at 566) decided that cl\u00a02(a) applied, he based this conclusion on \u201cwider grounds\u201d such as where the employee was based and the location of the employer\u2019s headquarters. However, this case does not stand for the proposition that where there is no meeting of the minds to enter into a contract, cl\u00a02(a) ought to apply nonetheless to the restitutionary obligation (see also [59] below). In this regard, it may be noted that in <i>Kartika Ratna</i> <i>Thahir v PT\u00a0Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina)</i> <nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 257</nobr> (\u201c<i>Thahir</i>\u201d), this court was of the view that a claim for the recovery of bribes came within cl\u00a0(2)(c) rather than cl\u00a0(2)(a).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While it is true that in <i>Hashim</i> and in <i>Thahir</i> the bribes were not paid pursuant to the respective contracts of employment, and indeed it cannot be argued that such payments were contemplated under the employment contracts, it cannot be denied that it was the existence of the employment contracts that provided the opportunity for the offer and receipt of the bribes. Thus there was this special link between the payment of the bribes and the bribe recipients\u2019 employment. That, notwithstanding, the court in <i>Hashim</i> took into account factors that, in our view, were also relevant under cl\u00a02(c), while this court held, unequivocally, in <i>Thahir</i> that cl\u00a02(c) applied (see [39] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It seems to us that whether it is a case of an \u201cineffective contact\u201d or a case of \u201ccontractual failure\u201d, both situations presuppose that the parties <i>had intended</i> to enter into the contract but that, due to other circumstances or reasons, the contract had become void or ineffective or a contractual failure had arisen. Clearly, in such situations, the parties intended to enter into the contract, including the choice of law clause. Thus it would be logical to apply that same law to consequential restitutionary obligations following either the contract becoming ineffective or a contractual failure. The rationale for this is apparent from the following passage of Lord Denning\u00a0MR in <i>Mackender v Feldia\u00a0AG</i> [1967] 2\u00a0QB 590 (\u201c<i>Mackender</i>\u201d) at 598:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I can well see that if the issue was whether there ever had been any contract at all, as, for instance, if there was a plea of non est factum, then the foreign jurisdiction clause might not apply at all. But here there was a contract, and when it was made, it contained the foreign jurisdiction clause. Even if there was non-disclosure, nevertheless non-disclosure does not automatically avoid the contract. It only makes it voidable. It gives the insurers a right to elect. They can either avoid the contract or affirm it. If they avoid it, it is avoided in this sense, that the insurers are no longer bound by it. They can repudiate the contract or refuse to pay on it. But things already done are not undone. The contract is not avoided from the beginning but only from the moment of avoidance. In particular, the foreign jurisdiction clause is not abrogated. A dispute as to non-disclosure is \u201ca dispute arising under\u201d the policy and remains within the clause: just as does a dispute as to whether one side or the other was entitled to repudiate the contract: see <i>Heyman</i> v. <i>Darwins Ltd</i> [[1942] AC\u00a0356].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It seems to me that [counsel for the underwriters\u2019] argument (to the effect that non-disclosure strikes out the whole contract) is not well founded. The foreign jurisdiction clause is a positive agreement by the underwriters that the policy is governed exclusively by Belgian law. Any dispute under it is to be exclusively subject to Belgian jurisdiction. That clause still stands and is a strong ground why discretion should be exercised against leave to serve out of the jurisdiction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the same case, Diplock\u00a0LJ explained (at 603\u2013604) why when it is said that a contract has become void it does not mean that there was no contract at all:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The fallacy in the argument to the contrary is that when what is said to be a \u201cvoidable\u201d contract is said to be \u201cavoided,\u201d that does not mean that the contract never existed but that it ceases to exist from the moment of avoidance, and that upon its ceasing there may then arise consequential rights in respect of things done in performance of it while it did exist which may have the effect of undoing those things as far as practicable. It is sometimes sought to assimilate the concept of avoidance of a voidable contract to the concept of <i>non est factum</i> which prevents a contract from ever coming into existence at all. It is argued that innocent misrepresentation or, in the case of contracts of insurance, non-disclosure of material facts vitiates consent and makes the apparent consent of the party misled, no consent at all. But this is specious. What is really meant is that the party did in fact consent but would not have done so if he had then known then what he knows now.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in the present action for restitution by Dresdner, both parties were in agreement that there was no contract under which the payment was made. It would be noted that, at [32] above, we have quoted CIMB\u2019s submission which we repeat:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">At the very least, from Dresdner\u2019s perspective, there was a relationship (with CIMB) which was intended to be entered into \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Obviously CIMB saw the difficulties of its own argument because there could be a contract only if there were two parties, yet CIMB could only say that as far as Dresdner was concerned there was an intention to enter into the contract. It could not say that CIMB intended to enter into the contract. This is the bind which CIMB could not get away from. How could it be said that there was an agreement when its position was that George Chau was not authorised, and that there was no contract? The entire situation smacked of CIMB wanting to have its cake and eat it too. CIMB was taking wholly inconsistent positions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exception to the rule</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated (at [31] above), the rule is that where a contract becomes ineffective or fails, the law that would govern the consequential claims arising therefrom would be the law of that contract. We now turn to an apparent exception to the rule where the invalidity of the contract is founded on duress or fraud. <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> states at para\u00a034\u2011024:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]t does not follow that the law which governed the contract should invariably govern the claim for restitution. First, in a case in which the invalidity of the contract is founded on duress or on fraud, and it is alleged that the duress meant that the express choice of law was itself liable to be set aside, it will be inappropriate to apply the expressly chosen law, even if this is the law which determined the validity or invalidity of the contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prof\u00a0Harris also recognised duress or fraud as a possible exception when he stated in his article ([33] <i>supra</i> at 326):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[W]here a contract is void on the grounds of mistake, the mistake may relate to the subject matter of the contract; but the choice of law clause may not have been the subject of a mistake at all. If so, then it may legitimately be used in respect of a claim in restitution arising from the mistake. However, if the contract is set aside as the product of duress, it may be that the choice of law clause itself was also a product of duress. If that is the case, then there should be no question of the law specified by the clause being used in respect of any restitutionary claim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Prof\u00a0Harris also wrote (<i>id</i> at 327):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he question will arise whether the factor which led to the invalidity of the contract itself also \u2018infects\u2019 and invalidates the choice of law clause. If it does \u2018infect\u2019 the clause, then the clause cannot logically survive. But if it does not, then the clause, logically separable from the contract and not rendered invalid, therefore still stands. If so, it may logically be used to determine a claim in restitution arising out of the contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would be seen that the fact that a contract is void due to duress or fraud does not necessarily mean that everything in the contract will be thrown out of the window. This is because fraud or duress can take many forms. For example, fraud could give rise to the plea of <i>non est factum</i> in which case everything in the contract must be discarded because the victim was defrauded into thinking that the document he executed was of a wholly different nature. As there was no intention on the part of the victim to enter into any contract, it is difficult to visualise why any terms therein should still apply to restitutionary issues. On the other hand, fraud can relate purely to the condition of the subject matter of the contract, <i>ie</i>, a case of fraudulent misrepresentation. In this scenario, it is clear that the victim intended to enter into the contract, including the choice of law clause. The fact that the victim could have the contract declared void on the ground of fraud does not mean that the victim did not intend to enter into the contract or that there was no contract. In this situation, it is probably reasonable and logical to apply the choice of law clause to any restitutionary issues that may arise between the parties. Indeed, if the parties had thought about it at the time of the contract, they would likely have agreed to the choice of law. The same will be the position where duress is concerned, depending on whether the effect of the duress goes to the root of the consent, <i>eg</i>, when a person was being forced or coerced into signing an \u201cagreement\u201d when he never intended to. Where (in the admittedly rare case) it can be demonstrated, on the facts, that the fraud or duress directly impacted the decision of the victim to agree to the choice of law clause itself, then obviously we would think that that clause would also have no legal effect.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would hasten to add that a contract may be void for other reasons too. One example would be the case where there was a common and fundamental mistake as to the subject matter of the contract. In such a situation, it does not mean that the parties did not intend to enter into the contract or that there was never any contract between them. A contract rendered invalid or void for such a reason need not necessarily impugn the express choice of law clause and there is some rationale for contending that such a choice of law should still govern the consequential restitutionary claims. As <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> commented at para\u00a034\u2011024:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]f the contract is void on account of a common and fundamental mistake as to the subject matter of the contract, there may be no objection to giving effect to an express choice of law: the parties may have been clear in their intention that Ruritanian law should govern the contract and any consequences of its invalidity, even though they were mistaken as to the existence of the subject matter of the contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge ventured to suggest (at [93] of the GD) that the following three situations fall within cl\u00a0(2)(c):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where the signature to an alleged contract is forged and the party purported to be a signatory to the contract does not even know the forged contract exists until perhaps after the forgery of that party\u2019s signature is discovered; \u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where an employee, on a frolic of his own, enters into an alleged contract on behalf of his employer when clearly the employee has no real or apparent authority to do so; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where the defence of <i>non est factum</i> to a claim under an alleged contract is made out.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We agree. In the three situations it is clear that the victim or the employer never intended to enter into the contract. In line with what is stated at [46] above, the choice of law clause in the \u201ccontract\u201d should not <i>ipso facto</i> be treated as applicable to consequential restitutionary issues.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore a contract being void as such does not assist us in determining whether the choice of law clause in the contract has still a role to play in consequential restitutionary issues. This is because a contract could be void for a variety of reasons or circumstances. There is a need to examine the factual circumstances of each case to see the cause for the contract being void. If the contract is declared void because there was, in the full sense of the word, no meeting of the minds to enter into that particular contract, <i>eg</i>, where the defence of <i>non est factum</i> is applicable, then we cannot see any reason or logic to give effect to any of the clauses therein. A restitutionary claim arising from such a void contract is really a claim independent and outside the contract because there is no contract to speak of in the first place. Thus in the passage of <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> which we have quoted at [36] above, the word \u201cgenerally\u201d is used.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if we were to look at the question from a slightly different angle by using the \u201cinfection\u201d test suggested by Prof\u00a0Harris (see [45] above) to determine whether a choice of law clause could still survive and apply to a consequential restitutionary claim if the \u201ccontact\u201d is void, the answer would still be the same. If a \u201ccontract\u201d is void because there was no meeting of the minds to enter into the agreement at all, and in effect there was no contract, it is extremely hard to imagine why the lack of consent should only \u201cinfect\u201d the other clauses but not the choice of law clause. We cannot see any rationale for saving the choice of law clause in such circumstances. To do that will be an unwarranted exercise in mental gymnastics or creative thinking. In such circumstances, the true position will be that there is no prior relation between the parties to which reference may be made or which may contribute to the identification of the proper law of the obligation to make the restitution.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, it is of interest to note that <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i>\u2019 commentary on cl\u00a02(c) at para\u00a034\u2011030 alluded to another category of mistakes, <i>viz</i>, mistakes of fact, to which cl\u00a02(c) would apply:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where money is paid to, or a benefit is conferred upon, another person with whom <i>no prior contract, or supposed contract, exists</i>, and it is alleged that the money or the value of the benefit is recoverable, e.g. because of a mistake of fact, the enrichment is likely to be most closely connected with the country in which it occurred, and the obligation to restore it to be governed by the law of that country. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It seems to us that, in the light of the commentaries made in paras\u00a034\u2011020, 34\u2011021 and 34\u2011028 of the same textbook (quoted at [34] and [35] above), this reference to \u201csupposed contract\u201d at para\u00a034\u2011030 must be read to mean a contract which the parties intended to enter into but due to one reason or another has been held to be void or has become ineffective or has failed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this context, a somewhat controversial case is <i>Baring Brothers &amp; Co Ltd v Cunninghame District Council</i> <nobr>[1997] CLC 108</nobr> (\u201c<i>Baring Brothers</i>\u201d) where it was agreed that the contract in question \u2013 a forward rate agreement entered into between the plaintiff banks and the defendant district council \u2013 was <i>ultra vires</i> the defendant. Lord Penrose held that the consequential restitutionary issues arising under a void contract were to be separately characterised and governed by a separate choice of law rule. This flowed from the fact that a claim was made in restitution because there was no contract and a claim could not be made under contract. The Court of Session held that the choice of law relating to the restitutionary issues was to be determined on the basis of which law the critical facts relating to the claim in restitution had their closest and most real connection with. Lord Penrose said (at 123):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The restitutionary remedy is available only because there is no contract, and there was no contractual obligation at the date of the transfer of assets. <i>The proper law of the contract has exhausted its purpose</i> in dictating that conclusion, and it is not attractive to proceed then to give direct effect to a term of the contract, where there is an express choice of law ... when the contract has ceased to have any validity as between the parties. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Baring Brothers</i> has received academic criticism because it failed to differentiate between restitutionary claims which did not arise out of any contract and those which arose out of contracts which the parties intended to enter into but subsequently became void for one reason or another. We agree with Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s observations in T\u00a0M\u00a0Yeo, <i>Choice of Law for Equitable Doctrines</i> (Oxford University Press, 2004) at para\u00a09.22 that \u201c[w]here a contract is avoided <i>ab initio</i>, legally it does not mean that the contract never existed; it means that the parties are treated as if the contract never existed\u201d (see also the views of Lord Denning\u00a0MR and Diplock\u00a0LJ in <i>Mackender</i> ([41] <i>supra</i>) quoted at [41] and [42] above). Prof\u00a0Yeo made five points against <i>Baring Brothers</i>, of which his third and fourth points, in our opinion, confirm that the criticism of <i>Baring Brothers</i> need not concern us in the instant appeal where there is no \u201cunderlying contract\u201d to speak of (at para\u00a09.22):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Thirdly, to use the applicable law of the contract to govern the restitutionary obligation is not to equate restitutionary claims with contractual claims; the recourse to <i>the law of the underlying contract</i> reflects a policy choice to apply a single law to closely connected issues. Fourthly, in practice, the application of the proper law of the contract will meet <i>the reasonable expectations of the parties</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our decision on the applicable law</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverting to the present case, the \u201cagreement\u201d is void because of the fraud of George Chau, a fraud which he perpetrated against both Dresdner and CIMB. Both Dresdner and CIMB agreed that there was no contract between them because George Chau went on a fraudulent frolic of his own. Even taking the \u201cinfection\u201d approach advocated by Prof\u00a0Harris (see [45] above), this fraud must infect the entire \u201cagreement\u201d. The \u201cagreement\u201d, including the choice of law clause, could not have bound CIMB (if CIMB, contrary to its stand here, was minded to take that position). If the choice of law clause in the void contract could not apply to CIMB, the same should be the position <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> Dresdner. It would be contrary to all principles to suggest that the clause could be effective only against one party and not the other. Accordingly, we found the following argument of Dresdner (at paras\u00a085 and 86 of the respondent\u2019s case) both germane and persuasive and here we quote:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">CIMB cannot have its cake and eat it too. Here, it is CIMB who has alleged fraud on the part of its own employee. It is CIMB who is disavowing the Agreement. It cannot at the same time also insist on relying on the express choice of law therein.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The position can be simply tested in a different way. Assuming the choice of law clause is unfavourable to CIMB, would it be fair that it can be used against CIMB? Obviously not, as CIMB had never agreed to, or even seen, the terms of the Agreement, and both parties accept that the Agreement is invalid. If that is the case, CIMB cannot likewise take advantage of the choice of law clause in the Agreement.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would reiterate that this was not a case where fraud was alleged by one party but disputed by the other party. In such an event, as stated at [30] above, the mere allegation of fraud is not in itself sufficient to impugn the choice of law clause in the contract (see <i>Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank Ltd v Banco Ambrosiano Veneto SPA</i> <nobr>[2000] SGHC 188</nobr>, and <i>Ash</i> ([30] <i>supra</i>)). Neither was it a case where the parties intended to enter into the contract and the fraud related only to the subject matter of the contract (see [46] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even moving away from treating the present case as one involving fraud and, instead, treating it as purely one where there was no meeting of the minds between the parties to enter into the contract, the answer to the question of choice of law for the unjust enrichment claim should still be the same. If there was no contract between the parties, as alleged by CIMB and accepted by Dresdner, what basis is there to say that the choice of law clause in the non-existent contract should still have some lingering effect so as to apply to the restitutionary claim? We would reiterate that here we were not concerned with a contract which the parties intended to enter into but which subsequently failed or became ineffective.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, we held that the present action for unjust enrichment did not come within cl\u00a02(a) but came within cl<i>\u00a0</i> 2(c) of <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i>\u2019 Rule\u00a0230 (see [31] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Real and closest connection</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will next examine which country Dresdner\u2019s present claim for unjust enrichment is most closely connected with. At this juncture, it may be opportune to remind ourselves of the rationale behind cl\u00a02(c) and here we would quote <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> at para\u00a034\u2011030:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]n the absence of a prior relationship between the parties to which reference may be made, or which may contribute to the identification of the proper law of the obligation to make restitution, the law of the place where the enrichment occurred may be expected to be that which has the best claim to be applied to any obligation to restore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Naturally, in view of the diverse situations in which a restitutionary claim may arise, the place of enrichment may not always be the place with which the claim has the closest connection. <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> at para\u00a034\u2011031 gives the example of a case where there is a \u201cpre-existing relationship between the parties which, though not contractual, may justify giving weight to the law which governed that relationship in the search for the law with which the obligation to make restitution has its closest connection\u201d. A case where such an exception was applied was <i>Hashim</i> ([39] <i>supra</i>) which concerned the recovery of a bribe received by an employee in Switzerland. On appeal, the Court of Appeal, in <i>Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim</i> [1996] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s\u00a0Rep 589 at 597 (<i>per</i> Saville\u00a0LJ), held that the applicable law to govern the recovery of the bribe was that of Abu Dhabi, as it was in Abu Dhabi that the relationship of employer and employee was created, and it was also there that the building contract was awarded to the briber as a result of the dishonest abuse of the briber\u2019s and the bribe recipient\u2019s (<i>ie</i>, the employee\u2019s) relationship with the third party concerned (<i>ie</i>, the employer). In the circumstances, the court did not regard as significant the fact that the bribe was paid in Switzerland.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Singapore was the location at which CIMB was unjustly enriched. Singapore was also the place where CIMB allegedly \u201cchanged its position in good faith\u201d by remitting the money to HSBC Hong Kong. As far as the present action is concerned, these are basically the only two key issues which the court has to address and nothing else. Witnesses and documents relevant to these two key issues are in the main to be found here. As mentioned before, while Paul Ma\u2019s present whereabouts are not known, his last-known place of residence was Singapore. Razak is not presently in Singapore but in Johor which is certainly more proximate to Singapore than England. As for George Chau, whose present whereabouts are not known, indications are that he is a Malaysian and likely to be resident in Malaysia, and the comment on Razak is equally applicable to George Chau\u2019s position.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alternative argument on the applicable law</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would finally refer to one further argument put forward by Dresdner, which we thought had some merits. It was that even if English law were to be the applicable law, little weight should be given to this factor. For this argument, Dresdner relied on para\u00a012\u2011029 of <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins</i> which states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If the legal issues are straightforward, or if the competing fora have domestic laws which are substantially similar, the identity of the governing law will be a factor of rather little significance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This statement of principle was accepted by David Steel\u00a0J in <i>Marconi Communications International Ltd v PT\u00a0Pan Indonesia Bank Ltd TBK</i> [2004] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 594 (at [36]) and <i>Navigators Insurance Co Ltd v Atlantic Methanol Production Co LLC</i> [2004] Lloyd\u2019s Rep\u00a0IR 418 at [48].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reliance was also placed by Dresdner on <i>Amerco Timbers Pte Ltd v Chatsworth Timber Corp Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1975-1977] SLR 258</nobr> where this court, in relation to a contract governed by Indonesian law, said (at 264, [36]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There is no evidence before this court that Indonesian law differs from our law in any significant respect concerning matters relating to this claim or that there is likely to be any serious dispute on the application of Indonesian law to the issues in this case. Besides there is no material to show that a Singapore court would have any difficulty in applying Indonesian law should the need arise. There may be cases where complicated issues of law are likely to arise when the application of the law by a foreign court may not be desirable and at best avoided but there is no material before us to infer that this is one such case. That being so we would attach little weight to this factor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reason why, in the consideration of the question of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, the issue of applicable law is a relevant factor is because where a dispute is governed by a foreign law, the forum will be less adept in applying that law than the courts of the country of that law, and there could be savings in time and resources in litigating the dispute in the forum of the applicable law. However, such advantages will not be obtained in the instant case because Singapore law on unjust enrichment is similar, if not identical, to that prevailing in England. Singapore courts would be able to apply English law without the aid of foreign experts. On this basis, the applicable law factor, even if it were English law, would not be a factor of much significance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Witnesses</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to consider the other factors which are relevant to the consideration of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. We will first consider the factor relating to witnesses. CIMB contended that most of the witnesses they intended to call to testify were located in England. They listed the following main witnesses who were located in London:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ms\u00a0Francis, the person at CIMB London who liaised with Ms\u00a0Callaghan of Dresdner London on the purported transaction;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ms\u00a0Nurdin, the Operations Manager of CIMB London, who communicated with Ms\u00a0Raihan Kamaruddin of CIMB\u00a0KL in relation to Dresdner\u2019s request to verify the Notes signed by George Chau; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aziz Mohd Jaafar, the immediate superior of Ms\u00a0Francis.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Furthermore, CIMB strongly contended that the employees of BPAL, whom they intended to call to testify as to their roles in the transaction, were also located in London.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the employees of CIMB Singapore who had dealings with the matter, CIMB highlighted that only one was still in Singapore; two others who played more important roles were no longer here. Of the latter, one was Paul Ma, who received the instructions from CIMB Inanam to transfer the Funds received from Dresdner to HSBC Hong Kong. Paul Ma is no longer in the employment of CIMB and his whereabouts are unknown. The other was Razak, who contacted CIMB Inanam to obtain confirmation of the instruction to remit the Funds to HSBC Hong Kong. Razak is still in the employment of CIMB but stationed in a branch in Johor, Malaysia.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, CIMB made the point that even the witnesses of Dresdner who were involved in the transaction were mainly in London. Besides Ms\u00a0Callaghan, the two gentlemen who signed the agreement for Dresdner, Steven Loughe and Steve Hagopian, were both located there. One other person, a Shaun Little (\u201cLittle\u201d) of Dresdner London who communicated with BPAL, was also in London.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first thing we would underscore is that since it was common ground that there was in fact no agreement in existence between Dresdner and CIMB, all the evidence relating to the making of that agreement was no longer relevant or in issue. All that remained was for Dresdner to explain why the payment was made even though Dresdner was informed (after the agreement was signed by George Chau) that two signatories were required for transactions above US$10,000. On this aspect, only the evidence of Ms\u00a0Callaghan and Little, who were involved in concluding the \u201cagreement\u201d and effecting the payment, would be material and relevant. Dresdner had indicated that there would be no problem in securing the attendance of these two persons for trial in Singapore. We did not think that any CIMB officer would really be able to add anything on that. If at all anyone from CIMB could help, it would be George Chau and, perhaps, Ms\u00a0Francis, the latter being the person who liaised with Ms\u00a0Callaghan of Dresdner London on the agreement. But we think the relevance of Ms\u00a0Francis\u2019s evidence on this point would, at best, be minimal. In any case, Ms\u00a0Francis is still in the employment of CIMB, so there should be no problem in CIMB arranging for her to testify anywhere.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence relating to the steps taken by CIMB Singapore after the receipt of the Funds from Dresdner would be available in Singapore. The staff of CIMB Singapore would be able to testify on that, particularly Paul Ma and Razak. Paul Ma has to explain why he did not act in accordance with the instructions in the SWIFT message and how these instructions were reconciled with the memorandum from CIMB Inanam to re-transfer the Funds to Hong Kong,</span><a id=\"_ftnref14\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 14]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">which led him to write a handwritten note to Razak as follows:</span><a id=\"_ftnref15\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 15]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Remitter VV Enterprise was supposed to send funds to HK but came to us instead. Inanam Br[anch] agreed we charge nominal for retransfer to HK. Your approval pls.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned before, the last-known place of residence of Paul Ma was Singapore and that of Razak, Johor. The staff of CIMB Singapore whom Paul Ma instructed to transfer the Funds to HSBC Hong Kong was one Ms\u00a0Roshida, who is in Singapore. This part of the events, which is at the heart of the present action by Dresdner against CIMB, has nothing to do with England. In considering the location of witnesses as a factor, the court must bear in mind the issues in the action. Only witnesses whose evidence is potentially material and relevant to the issues in the action should be reckoned. The witnesses whom CIMB identified, and who are in England, would not be able to help in relation to the material issues of the action. Moreover, location of witnesses is only really significant in relation to third-party witnesses who are not in the employ of the party as it could give rise to issues of compellability (see <i>Rickshaw Investments</i> ([25] <i>supra</i>) at [19]). Thus this factor as to the location of witnesses required to prove or defend the claim for restitution, points more to Singapore as being the more natural forum to hear the substantive dispute. We repeat, Paul Ma, Razak and George Chau are key witnesses and they have nothing to do with England. Paul Ma is presumably in Singapore. George Chau is probably in Sabah, Malaysia. Razak is in Johor. Plainly, it would be more convenient, and less expensive, for witnesses to travel from Malaysia to Singapore. We are conscious that in this technologically advanced age, the convenience of witnesses who may be located in a different jurisdiction should also be considered against the easy availability of video conferencing (see <i>Peters Roger May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</i> <nobr>[2006] 2 SLR 381</nobr> at [26] and [27]). Thus the question of the compellability of the witnesses assumes greater importance and, on this score, bearing in mind the issues raised in the present action, we were inclined to hold that it favoured a trial in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Third party claims</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We accept the proposition that a multiplicity of <i>closely</i> related proceedings continuing simultaneously before different courts in different jurisdictions is obviously undesirable.

In <i>Myers</i>, the plaintiff purchaser sued the defendant vendors for misrepresentation and breach of the implied covenants for title in a registered property transferred to him on the ground that he was not given notice of the variation of a sub-lease which gave only the sub-lessee the right to determine the sub-lease. The defendants served a third-party notice on their solicitors. It would be apparent that the main action and the third-party claim were inextricably linked. If the defendants were held liable to the plaintiff, the defendants would be entitled to claim indemnity or contribution from the third party who was the firm of solicitors acting for the defendants in the transaction. The duty of the third party to the defendants essentially mirrored the duty of the defendants to the plaintiff. Goff\u00a0J held that even if he were wrong in his view that there was sufficient similarity to bring the case within O\u00a016 r\u00a01(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI\u00a01965 No\u00a01776) (UK), it could still fall within r\u00a01(1)(<i>c</i>) (both sub-clauses of O\u00a016 were <i>in pari materia</i> with the corresponding sub-clauses in the Rules of Court (at [70] above)).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dresdner\u2019s claim against CIMB is for restitution on the ground of unjust enrichment. However, from the affidavits filed by CIMB it was clear that its third-party claim against BPAL would be for negligence or failure to exercise due diligence and/or for conspiracy to defraud. The issues in the present action by Dresdner and in the potential third-party claim by CIMB against BPAL would be very different and so would the evidence required to substantiate those claims. Nothing can better illustrate the differences between the two claims than to quote <i>in extenso</i> what CIMB alleged in its affidavit against BPAL:</span><a id=\"_ftnref16\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 16]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BPAL London was the arranger of the transaction and took for itself a large fee (approximately US$695,000) yet appears to have carried out almost no due diligence. BPAL failed to investigate Innaria and the underlying Innaria contract and failed to identify that the underlying transaction was completely fictitious. CIMB will say that this was clearly negligent, and further that BPAL\u2019s failure to investigate the transaction properly was so striking that it can be inferred that BPAL must have acted recklessly (i.e. it failed to ask obvious questions about the transaction for fear that it might find out the truth \u2013 that the transaction was a fraud)[.]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BPAL knew that none of the other parties to the transaction was in a position to carry out due diligence \u2013 CIMB charged no fee for their part and [Dresdner] charged only $21,000. They therefore must have known that the other parties to the transaction were relying on them to carry out the necessary checks. This emphasises BPAL\u2019s negligence (or recklessness) in relation to \u2026 whether the transaction was genuine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were irregularities in relation to various documents connected with the transaction which a reasonable person in the position of BPAL would have investigated further. For example, an approval letter dated 14 March 2002 purportedly from Malaysia\u2019s Central Bank was sent to Innaria in English and then a later letter from Malaysia\u2019s Central Bank dated 10 May 2002 was in Bahasa Malaysia and needed to be translated into English. Again, CIMB will say that BPAL\u2019s failure to properly investigate this and other irregularities is evidence of negligence and recklessness as to the genuineness of the transaction on the part of BPAL.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BPAL also co-ordinated the actions of George Chau, the employee of CIMB who was found by an internal investigation to have acted fraudulently in endorsing the notes without authority. They must have known that he was acting without authority, or failed to enquire, which would be evidence of negligence and recklessness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Innaria [was] a dormant company without its own premises at the time of issuing the Notes. BPAL failed to investigate Innaria\u2019s financial position and ability to meet its financial obligations under the Notes or was willfully blind to evidence which showed Innaria\u2019s true financial position. Had BPAL properly investigated Innaria\u2019s financial position, it would have been obvious that Innaria was not in a position to make payment under the Notes and that Innaria\u2019s claims to be [a] sub-contractor in a US$200 million government project were false. Again, an honest and careful party in BPAL\u2019s position would have asked questions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Notes with which this dispute is concerned are not the only ones arranged by BPAL. They also arranged other fraudulent schemes including a second tranche of Innaria promissory notes for US$15m (that were never paid because the fraud was identified by CIMB), and notes for other Malaysian entities (named Safire and Citra Pedoman) that were later found to be fraudulent. It is difficult to believe that BPAL can have arranged all of these transactions without knowing that they involved frauds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What we see here are two very distinct claims which are based on very different allegations of fact with nothing in common except that they each involved the Notes. Our case here is unlike that in <i>Myers</i> ([71] <i>supra</i>)<i>.</i> It is also different from <i>Firststate Pte Ltd v Raviland Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 589</nobr> (\u201c<i>Firststate</i>\u201d) which was cited by CIMB and we need only quote from the appellant\u2019s case to show that there is no parallel between <i>Firststate</i> and the present action against CIMB:</span><a id=\"_ftnref17\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 17]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The case of <i>Firststate</i> \u2026 involves the [defendant] alleging fraud in [its] counterclaim against the plaintiff. The [defendant] also claimed against proposed third parties (individuals who were corporate officers of the plaintiff) in using the plaintiff company as a vehicle for fraud.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would be noted that in <i>Firststate</i> the defendant alleged fraud against both the plaintiff and the proposed third parties, the latter being the officers of the plaintiff. Clearly the main action and the proposed third party action were inextricably linked and the defendant was relying on very much the same facts in both the proceedings. This would not be the situation in the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another case relied upon by CIMB was <i>Baring</i> <i>Futures (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Deloitte &amp; Touche</i> <nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 312</nobr> (\u201c<i>Baring Futures</i>\u201d). In that case, Barings plc, an English company, and Barings Securities Ltd (\u201cBSL\u201d), an indirect subsidiary of Barings plc, commenced an action in the English High Court against five defendants for negligence or breach of contract in the audit and reporting of the accounts of Barings Futures (Singapore) (\u201cBFS\u201d), a Singapore company that was an indirect subsidiary of BSL. BFS\u2019s auditors during the material time were Deloitte &amp; Touche Singapore (\u201cD&amp;T\u201d) and Coopers &amp; Lybrand Singapore (\u201cC&amp;L\u201d). Among the five defendants in the English action were representative defendants of D&amp;T and representative defendants of C&amp;L. One month later, the liquidators of BFS commenced an action in Singapore against D&amp;T and C&amp;L. D&amp;T applied to stay the Singapore action on the ground that London was the <i>forum conveniens</i> to hear BFS\u2019s claim. D&amp;T indicated that it would join BFS as a third party in the English action for the purposes of, <i>inter alia</i>, contribution and to ensure that BFS, D&amp;T and the plaintiffs in the English action would be bound by the same decision. If its application for a stay of the Singapore action failed, D&amp;T would join Barings plc, BSL and Coopers &amp; Lybrand London as proper and necessary parties to the action commenced by BFS in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In granting a stay in <i>Baring Futures</i>, Lai Kew Chai\u00a0J recognised that the two actions raised many common factual questions and added (at [2]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[O]nly by bringing all the principal players together before one forum for adjudication could the responsibility be justly, sensibly and more efficiently ascertained and distributed between those concerned \u2026 This approach would avoid the potential disaster of inconsistent verdicts which could be given if similar disputes with overlapping facts involving the same or different parties were litigated before two courts in two different jurisdictions \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Again, it would be seen that <i>Baring Futures</i> was quite a different sort of a case because there, very much the same facts were germane for both the main action and the third party proceedings. However, the issues in the present action in Singapore would not be similar to those which would be raised in the contemplated third-party action by CIMB against BPAL. There is no danger of there being \u201ctwo sets of litigation involving substantially the same parties over substantially the same underlying transactions\u201d as was the case in <i>Baring Futures</i> (at [25])<i>.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A third case relied upon by CIMB was <i>IPCO International Construction Ltd v S\u00a0T\u00a0Kay &amp; Co</i> <nobr>[1998] SGHC 198</nobr> (\u201c<i>IPCO</i>\u201d) but this case could hardly be of assistance to CIMB because the circumstances in <i>IPCO</i> were again quite distinct. There, when the Singapore action was commenced by the plaintiff, proceedings had already been commenced in the Philippines by the third party, a company incorporated in the Philippines, against the Singapore defendant and where the defendant had also joined the plaintiff as a third party. The defendant and the third party then separately applied to stay the Singapore action in the light of the existing action in the Philippines. Their applications were granted and the court noted that the main dispute in the case was really between the plaintiff and the third party, and that the defendant was caught in the middle. The following passages of the High Court in <i>IPCO</i> (at [36] and [41]), which were quoted by CIMB, deserve to be considered carefully:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In my judgment, one had to consider the entire circumstances of the case and the nature of the proceedings. In this case, the matters involving the third party and the plaintiffs were inextricably linked with the dispute between the [plaintiff] and the [defendant] \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 In my judgment, the entire proceedings involving all three parties should properly be before the same Court. I regarded the third party proceedings as an integral and inseparable part of the main action. The defendants in the third party proceedings were not claiming for any contribution or indemnity from the third party. Therefore, it would not be right to stay the third party proceedings in favour of the Philippines proceedings but allow the action between the [plaintiff] and the [defendant] to be tried in Singapore. Multiplicity of closely related proceedings continuing simultaneously before different courts in different jurisdictions was obviously undesirable. Concurrent litigation involving the same parties and the same issues leads to unnecessary expense and inconvenience to the parties, quite apart from the very real risk of conflicting decisions being handed down.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would also add that even if Dresdner were to succeed against CIMB for unjust enrichment, it would not follow that CIMB would succeed against BPAL. CIMB has to prove negligence or breach of duty or conspiracy on the part of BPAL. There will be no question of \u201cinconsistent\u201d judgments arising. If CIMB\u2019s third-party claim were to be heard together with the present action, it would only prolong the trial and much of it would have nothing to do with Dresdner; it would be making Dresdner sit through the hearing of issues which do not concern it. A joint hearing would cause hardship to Dresdner with the net result that it would only add to costs and prolong the time that Dresdner would need to spend on the case. Here it would be useful for us to refer to <i>Chatsworth Investments Ltd v Amoco</i> (<i>UK</i>) <i>Ltd</i> [1968] Ch\u00a0665 where Cross\u00a0J made these comments (at 676) and whose decision, including his views on this point, was upheld on appeal:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span class=\"Judg-quote-1Char\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Finally, looking at this case from the broader standpoint of the exercise of discretion, I think that, even if contrary to my opinion it falls within the wording of Ord.\u00a016, r.\u00a01(1)(<i>b</i>), it would not be right to allow the question of the enforceability of the later agreement to be tried in the same action as the question of the enforceability of the earlier agreement. To do so would be a hardship both to the plaintiffs and to the third parties, since it might add considerably to the costs and the time spent, and there would not, as far as I can see, be any compensating advantage. The third parties know nothing of the circumstances in which the earlier agreement was entered into, and if they did give the undertaking to which I have referred, that is all that the defendants can reasonably require.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CIMB made the bare assertion at para\u00a0156 of the appellant\u2019s case that its conspiracy and contribution claims (based on negligence and/or breach of duty) against BPAL raised issues which related to the circumstances involving the mistaken payment and its defence of change of position. CIMB did not show the basis for such an assertion. No sufficient explanation was given as to the link between the present action and the third-party claim against BPAL. None of the allegations which CIMB made against BPAL (quoted at [72] above) indicate any such linkage. CIMB also made the point that in relation to the Notes, Dresdner was BPAL\u2019s \u201cclosing Bank\u201d. However, CIMB did not explain what \u201cclosing bank\u201d meant or entailed. It also did not explain why, just because Dresdner was the \u201cclosing bank\u201d of BPAL, that provided the link to the present action by Dresdner. It seemed to us that all these allegations of supposed links were made so that Dresdner\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment would appear more complex than it really is. There was just a lot of smoke generated and nothing else.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, no action has yet been commenced anywhere by CIMB against BPAL. As regards the third-party claim by CIMB against HSBC Hong Kong, no particulars as to the basis of claim have yet been disclosed. It is of interest to note that whereas CIMB emphasised its third-party claim against BPAL in seeking to establish that England was the more appropriate forum, it said very little as regards its third-party claim against HSBC Hong Kong, presumably because the claim against HSBC Hong Kong had no connection whatsoever with England.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We must emphasise, and this seemed to have been overlooked by CIMB, that the real test to determine whether a third-party action should be heard together with the main action is not that of connection alone but whether they are inextricably linked and the third-party action is an integral and inseparable part of the main action. This has not been shown to be the case here.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another point raised by CIMB is that if the trial of the action by Dresdner were to be held in Singapore, CIMB would not be able to compel BPAL\u2019s employees to testify here. First, we could not see what relevant evidence BPAL\u2019s employees could give in relation to the present action for unjust enrichment. Second, as we perceived it, with a third-party action hanging over the head of BPAL, we, like the Judge, did not think it realistic for CIMB to expect co\u2011operation from BPAL. And if, in fact, BPAL was prepared to co\u2011operate, there should be no difficulties in either getting those employees of BPAL to come to Singapore to be witnesses or obtaining their evidence through video link, if at all they had anything to say on the material issues.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Exercise of discretion</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear that in determining whether or not to grant a stay of proceedings, the judge will be exercising a discretion. Such an exercise of discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate court unless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of principle, or he had taken into account matters which he ought not to have taken into account or had failed to take into account matters which he ought to have taken into account, or his decision is plainly wrong (see <i>The Abidin Daver</i> [1984] AC\u00a0398 at 420 <i>per</i> Lord Brandon of Oakbrook).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the end of the day, weighing the various connecting factors is not a numbers game. We would point out that it is the legal significance of those factors in order to achieve the ends of justice which would be decisive. In our opinion, all that had occurred between the two London offices of Dresdner and CIMB were not in issue in the present action. The matters that are at the heart of the unjust enrichment claim all occurred in Singapore and it is Singapore which has the most and closest connection with the claim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of the foregoing, we did not think that CIMB had demonstrated that England was clearly the more appropriate forum to hear the present action brought against it by Dresdner. At best, even taking the position that English law is the applicable law for the restitution claim, we did not think, given the cause of action, that the relevant factors clearly point to England being the more appropriate forum to hear the dispute between the parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Stage two of the</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Spiliada <em>test</em></span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In case we were wrong in the determination of stage one of the <i>Spiliada</i> test, we come next to stage two of the <i>Spiliada</i> test (see [26] above). Dresdner argued that it would be severely prejudiced if its action were not heard in Singapore because it would be deprived of the opportunity to subpoena essential witnesses who would be required to demolish CIMB\u2019s defence of change of position in good faith. Here, quite clearly, Dresdner had in mind witnesses such as Paul Ma, Razak and Ms\u00a0Roshida.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The crucial question is, how does this weigh against CIMB\u2019s contention that if the main action were to be held here, it would not be able to subpoena BPAL\u2019s employees, who were in London, as well as its London employees who had left its employment, to testify? In any event, as stated in [83] above, and bearing in mind the third-party proceeding hanging over the head of BPAL, it would not be likely that BPAL\u2019s employees would co\u2011operate. If BPAL did not wish to co\u2011operate, it would be foolhardy for CIMB to call BPAL\u2019s employees to testify. If, on the other hand, BPAL were prepared to co\u2011operate, then the question of the compellability of BPAL\u2019s employees would become academic.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As submitted by Dresdner, the facts and issues in CIMB\u2019s claim against BPAL in negligence and conspiracy would be very different from those needed to prove the claim in the present action. There would be no common factual questions and no inextricable link between the present action and the third-party claim by CIMB against BPAL. The Judge thought that the appropriate forum to hear the action by CIMB against BPAL was probably England (at [127] of the GD). We agree, but ultimately in the present action, whether or not Dresdner would be able to succeed in its claim against CIMB would in fact depend on whether Dresdner could show bad faith when CIMB Singapore transferred the Funds to HSBC Hong Kong. For this critical question, the evidence would be here in Singapore. Thus, even if it were shown that the present action and the proposed CIMB\u2019s third-party claim against BPAL are intricately linked (which we do not think is the case), and that, contrary to what we hold, England is the more appropriate forum to hear the action, we were, for the aforesaid reasons, of the opinion that justice required that the action be nevertheless heard in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, we affirmed the Judge\u2019s decision that the present action would be temporarily stayed pending the completion of the German proceedings. In the meantime, CIMB could proceed with its intended third-party actions. In the result, CIMB\u2019s appeal was dismissed with costs with the usual consequential orders.</span></p>\n\n<div><br clear=\"all\"/>\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at pp 97\u2013110.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 2]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at pp 106\u2013108.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 3]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at pp 94\u201395.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 4]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at pp 172.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 5]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Datin Norhayati Hashim\u2019s 3rd affidavit filed on 10 December 2007 at para 24(b), Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at p 165.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn6\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 6]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Simon Jonathan Leifer\u2019s affidavit filed on 26 October 2007 at para 19, Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at p 247.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn7\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref7\" name=\"_ftn7\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 7]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at p 127.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn8\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref8\" name=\"_ftn8\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 8]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at p 122.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn9\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref9\" name=\"_ftn9\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 9]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at p 127.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn10\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref10\" name=\"_ftn10\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 10]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at p 129.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn11\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref11\" name=\"_ftn11\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 11]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Datin Norhayati Hashim\u2019s 1st affidavit filed on 9 November 2002 at para 16, Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol II at p 76.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn12\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref12\" name=\"_ftn12\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 12]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">At para\u00a057 of the respondent\u2019s case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn13\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref13\" name=\"_ftn13\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 13]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">At paras 71 and 73 of the appellant\u2019s case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn14\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref14\" name=\"_ftn14\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 14]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle vol.

We dismissed the appeal and now give the reasons for our decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</i> <nobr>[2007] 4 SLR 100</nobr> (\u201c<i>Spandeck</i>\u201d), this court set out the applicable test in Singapore for ascertaining the existence of a duty of care in cases involving claims for pure economic loss (\u201ccases of pure economic loss\u201d) and cases involving claims for personal injuries and/or physical damage (collectively, \u201ccases of physical damage\u201d). The present appeal raises the issue as to what the applicable principles are for ascertaining whether a duty of care exists <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> cases involving psychiatric illness or nervous shock (collectively referred to as \u201cpsychiatric harm\u201d in these grounds of decision).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the focus of the hearing for the present appeal was on the decision of the Judge as to the question of whether the respondent had negligently caused the first appellant to suffer physical injuries, the second appellant\u2019s claim that the respondent had caused her to suffer clinical depression entailed a consideration of the applicable principles for ascertaining whether a duty of care exists in cases of psychiatric harm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><strong>The facts</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first appellant (the first plaintiff in the proceedings below), Ngiam Kong Seng, was the owner and the rider (at the material time) of motorcycle licence plate No\u00a0AZ\u00a03210\u00a0S (\u201cthe Motorcycle\u201d). The second appellant (the second plaintiff in the court below), Quek Sai Wah, is the wife of the first appellant. The respondent (the second defendant in the proceedings below), Lim Chiew Hock, was the driver of taxi licence plate No\u00a0SHA\u00a09997\u00a0P (\u201cthe Taxi\u201d).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first appellant, while riding the Motorcycle towards Ang Mo Kio, was involved in a traffic accident (\u201cthe Accident\u201d), which was allegedly caused by the respondent (who was then driving the Taxi), on 27\u00a0January 2004 at about 3.19pm along the Central Expressway. As a result of the Accident, the first appellant sustained severe injuries which rendered him a tetraplegic. The first appellant is now dependent for the rest of his life on a caregiver \u2013 the main caregiver being the second appellant \u2013 for activities relating to daily living and mobility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the time of the Accident, the first appellant was 61 years old, and was working for the Port of Singapore Authority as an operations supervisor. He was due to retire a year later. The second appellant was 59 years old at the material time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both immediately after and during the period following the Accident, the respondent represented himself to be a helpful bystander who had rendered assistance to the first appellant. The second appellant was, accordingly, led to believe that the respondent was a good Samaritan and developed feelings of gratitude towards him. The inquiries by the appellants\u2019 solicitors eventually led to the second appellant being told that the respondent had been involved in the Accident. She subsequently suffered from major depression and suicidal tendencies resulting from, she claimed, having been \u201cbetrayed\u201d (see the GD at [12]) by the respondent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants eventually started an action in negligence against the owner of the Taxi, CityCab Pte Ltd (the first defendant in the proceedings below), and the respondent. The claim against CityCab Pte Ltd was withdrawn before the trial in the High Court. The first appellant alleged that at the material time, the Taxi had collided into the rear of the Motorcycle, causing him to be flung backwards and onto the road. It was argued that the collision had been caused by the respondent\u2019s negligence, which was particularised to include, <i>inter alia</i>, driving at an excessive speed, failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to steer a safe and proper course, and failing to maintain a safe distance from the Motorcycle. The second appellant alleged that she had suffered from clinical depression as a result of:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the respondent\u2019s failure to inform her of the severity of the first appellant\u2019s injuries and of his (the respondent\u2019s) involvement in the Accident; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the respondent\u2019s conduct in causing her to believe that he had been a helpful bystander at the time of the Accident.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In his defence, it was argued by the respondent that the Accident had not been caused by a collision between the Taxi and the Motorcycle, but had instead occurred after the Motorcycle had \u201cself-skidded\u201d<a id=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 1]</span></span></a>. The respondent was adamant that the Taxi had not hit the Motorcycle, and argued that even if there had been a collision between the two vehicles, it would have taken place after the Motorcycle had self-skidded. The respondent denied that the Accident had been caused or contributed to by his negligence, and argued that it had been caused or contributed to instead by the negligence of the first appellant in riding the Motorcycle. In so far as the second appellant\u2019s claim was concerned, the respondent argued that if the second appellant had indeed suffered the loss, damage and expense alleged, these would have been caused solely or partly by the negligence of the first appellant. The respondent also argued that the second appellant\u2019s claim should fail as she had not witnessed the Accident; nor had she been of sufficient proximity in time or space to the scene of the Accident such as would result in her alleged psychiatric problems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the trial, in so far as the appellants\u2019 case was concerned, both appellants testified, along with their eldest son, Ngiam Peng Hong. They also adduced expert testimony from medical practitioners on the mental state of the second appellant. In so far as the respondent\u2019s defence was concerned, the respondent testified, along with an independent witness, his passenger at the material time, Ms\u00a0Maureen Andrew (\u201cMs\u00a0Andrew\u201d), as well as an accident reconstruction expert. The Traffic Police investigating officer who had investigated the case, Staff Sergeant\u00a0Andy Foo (\u201cMr\u00a0Foo\u201d), was also called upon by the respondent to testify as an independent witness. (At the time of the trial, Mr\u00a0Foo had already resigned from the Singapore Police Force to become an insurance agent.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><strong>The decision below</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Liability was the only issue which had to be determined in the court below. For the first appellant\u2019s claim, the Judge had to consider whether the respondent, on the facts, was \u201cresponsible for the first [appellant\u2019s] condition\u201d (see the GD at [74]). This issue was also described as follows (see the GD at [26]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">What was common ground was that the first plaintiff [<i>ie</i>, the first appellant] lost control of the [M]otorcycle. What was in dispute was why he lost control. Was it because the [T]axi rear-ended the [M]otorcycle as the first plaintiff asserted? Or, as the second defendant [<i>ie</i>, the respondent] was to contend, \u2026 was [it] because the [M]otorcycle self-skidded due to the wet and slippery road and not because of any impact with the [T]axi[?]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge found the evidence of the first appellant to be inconsistent with regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, which part of the Motorcycle had been hit and how he had fallen off the Motorcycle. The Judge found the respondent\u2019s evidence, in contrast, to be consistent. Moreover, the evidence of the independent witnesses (Ms\u00a0Andrew and Mr\u00a0Foo), as well as other evidence including, <i>inter alia</i>, evidence of the absence of damage to the vehicles concerned supported the respondent\u2019s case. The Judge, accordingly, came to the conclusion that the respondent\u2019s version of the events should be accepted and that the first appellant\u2019s claim should therefore be dismissed (see the GD at [75]\u2013[83]).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the second appellant was concerned, the Judge was of the view that the second appellant\u2019s case hinged on the first appellant\u2019s case, and, therefore, since the first appellant\u2019s claim had been dismissed, the second appellant\u2019s claim must, as a consequence, fail <i>in limine</i> (see the GD at [87]). The Judge also held that even if the respondent had been found to be liable to the first appellant, the second appellant\u2019s claim would still have been rejected on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that (see the GD at [87]\u2013[90]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the claim had no basis in law and was too remote;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the depression suffered by the second appellant had been caused by her inability to cope with her new burden of being the first appellant\u2019s primary caregiver, rather than by the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the claim had merely been an afterthought.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><strong>The first appellant\u2019s case on appeal</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before this court, the first appellant argued that the decision of the Judge on the facts \u2013 that the respondent was not responsible for the Accident \u2013 should be overturned. The law on whether an appellate court should overturn a finding of fact by a trial judge is clear and need not be elaborated upon, save to state that a trial judge\u2019s finding of fact must be plainly wrong before it will be overturned by an appellate court. We rejected the first appellant\u2019s arguments on appeal as there was no basis for finding that the Judge\u2019s decision was plainly wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only witness who firmly testified that the Accident had been caused by the respondent was the first appellant himself. However, there were inconsistencies in his evidence, as correctly pointed out by the Judge. Even if we had disregarded the inconsistencies, more evidence would have been needed to establish the first appellant\u2019s claim on a balance of probabilities as the Motorcycle had (allegedly) been hit in the rear, meaning that the first appellant could not have actually witnessed any collision as he would, in all likelihood, have been looking ahead (thus facing the opposite direction) and not behind at the alleged point of contact between the Motorcycle and the Taxi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only other eyewitnesses of the Accident who testified were the respondent and Ms\u00a0Andrew. Of great significance was the fact that the evidence of Ms\u00a0Andrew, an independent witness, not only did not contradict the respondent\u2019s evidence, but also did not support the first appellant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of even greater significance was the lack of objective evidence in support of the first appellant\u2019s case. The Traffic Police accident reports and the post-accident pictures of the Motorcycle and the Taxi revealed that there had been no damage to the rear of the Motorcycle and the front of the Taxi. The only \u201cdamage\u201d that the first appellant could point to was a semi-circular black mark (which was described in the appellants\u2019 written submissions as an \u201cimprint\u201d<a id=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[note: 2]</span></span></a>) located on the left side of the Taxi just below the left wing mirror. It was contended that this was proof that the Taxi had struck the storage box at the rear of the Motorcycle (\u201cthe rear box\u201d). Having examining photographs of the imprint, we agreed with the accident reconstruction expert\u2019s view, which was in fact consistent with common knowledge of the forces of nature, that it would have been physically impossible for the imprint to have been created by the Taxi hitting the rear box. The shape of the imprint was such that in order for the semi-circular arch to have been created, the rear box must have made contact with the Taxi initially at a point lower than the crest of the curve, with the point or area of contact then going up to the crest before going down again. In other words, the Motorcycle would have had to first fall, make contact with the Taxi, and then rise and fall again. This would be against the laws of gravity. Other than the rear box, only the tyres of the Motorcycle could possibly have caused the imprint on the Taxi, but we found this suggestion implausible. For one, as the accident reconstruction expert testified, the imprint was not consistent with the height of the front wheel of the Motorcycle, based on height measurements taken of that wheel and of the left side of the Taxi. As for the likelihood of the Motorcycle\u2019s rear tyre having caused the imprint, we likewise found this highly unlikely as that tyre was surrounded (or, loosely speaking, \u201cprotected\u201d) by protruding objects such as the exhaust pipes, the rear foot rest, the rear box and the rear suspension. If there had indeed been contact between the Motorcycle and the Taxi, these protrusions at the rear of the Motorcycle, rather than the rear tyre itself, would have come into contact with the Taxi first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the foregoing reasons, we came to the conclusion that the first appellant had failed to establish his case on a balance of probabilities and, accordingly, dismissed the appeal as far as he was concerned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><strong>The second appellant\u2019s case on appeal</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second appellant argued that the Judge had erred in holding that her claim for damages for clinical depression should fail and challenged the latter\u2019s reasons for this decision. In our view, before considering the substantive merits of the second appellant\u2019s arguments, it would be appropriate, first, to set out the applicable principles relating to the ascertainment of liability in the context of claims in negligence for psychiatric harm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><strong>The law relating to claims in negligence for psychiatric harm</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>Overview</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The general position in Singapore with respect to liability for negligence in cases of <i>pure economic loss</i> and cases of <i>physical damage</i> has now been settled by the recent decision of this court in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>). Briefly stated, the position in Singapore follows, in the main, the two-stage test laid down by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Anns</i> <i>v Merton London Borough Council</i> [1978] AC\u00a0728 (\u201c<i>Anns</i>\u201d), where the learned law lord observed, as follows (at 751\u2013752):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[I]n order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situation, <i>it is not necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty of care has been held to exist.</i> Rather the question has to be approached in two stages. First one has to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suffered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter \u2013 in which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly, if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of persons to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it may give rise \u2026 [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More specifically, Chan Sek Keong\u00a0CJ, delivering the judgment of the court in <i>Spandeck</i>, observed thus (at [73]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b><i>In our view, a coherent and workable test can be fashioned out of the basic two-stage test premised on proximity and policy considerations, if its application is preceded by a preliminary requirement of</i></b> <i>factual</i> <i><b>foreseeability. We would add that this test is to be applied</b> incrementally</i>, <b><i>in the sense that when applying the test in each stage, it would be desirable to refer to decided cases in analogous situations to see how the courts have reached their conclusions in terms of proximity and/or policy.</i></b> As is obvious, the existence of analogous precedents, which determines the current limits of liability, would make it easier for the later court to determine whether or not to extend its limits. However, the absence of a factual precedent, which implies the presence of a novel situation, should not preclude the court from extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking into account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate liability against a tortfeasor. <b><i>We would admit at this juncture that this is basically a restatement of the two-stage test in Anns, tempered by the preliminary requirement of factual foreseeability. Indeed, we should point out that this is the test applied in substance by many jurisdictions in the Commonwealth</i></b>: see, for example, the Canadian case of <i>Cooper v Hobart</i> (2001) 206\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th)\u00a0193; the New Zealand case of <i>Rolls-Royce New Zealand Ltd v Carter Holt Harvey Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] 1 NZLR 324</nobr> \u2026 [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In a similar vein, the learned Chief Justice summarised the applicable law in Singapore at the end of the judgment in <i>Spandeck</i> in the following terms (at [115]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">To recapitulate: A <i>single</i> test to determine the existence of a duty of care should be applied regardless of the nature of the damage caused (<i>ie</i>, pure economic loss or physical damage). It could be that a more restricted approach is preferable for cases of pure economic loss but this is to be done within the confines of a single test. <b><i>This test is a two-stage test, comprising of, first, proximity and, second, policy considerations. These two stages are to be approached with reference to the facts of decided cases although the absence of such cases is not an absolute bar against a finding of duty. There is, of course, the threshold issue of factual foreseeability but since this is likely to be fulfilled in most cases, we do not see the need to include this as part of the</i></b> <i>legal <b>test for a duty of care.</b></i> [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court in <i>Spandeck</i> did not need to consider what ought to be the applicable legal rules and principles with respect to liability in the sphere of <i>psychiatric harm</i>. That particular issue, however, arises in the present appeal in relation to the second appellant and raises an important (and related) question: To what extent is the two-stage test laid down in <i>Spandeck</i> applicable in the sphere of psychiatric harm? By way of a brief overview of the answer to this question, which will be elaborated upon in more detail in a moment, this same two-stage test applies in cases of psychiatric harm as well, although specific criteria would apply in this particular context.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The law relating to liability in negligence for psychiatric harm has had a lengthy and (to a large extent) chequered history (see, generally, Peter R\u00a0Handford, <i>Mullany and Handford\u2019s Tort Liability for Psychiatric Damage</i> (Lawbook Co, 2nd\u00a0Ed, 2006), especially at ch\u00a01). It is clear, however, that a significant legal watershed occurred when the leading decision of the House of Lords in <i>McLoughlin v O\u2019Brian</i> [1983] 1\u00a0AC 410 (\u201c<i>McLoughlin</i>\u201d) was delivered in 1982 (this was followed in subsequent decisions, notably, the (also) House of Lords decisions of <i>Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police</i> [1992] 1\u00a0AC 310 (\u201c<i>Alcock</i>\u201d) and <i>White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police</i> [1999] 2\u00a0AC 455 (\u201c<i>White</i>\u201d)). The next major landmark in this area of the law (also laid down by the House of Lords) was the decision in <i>Page v Smith</i> [1996] AC\u00a0155 (\u201c<i>Page</i>\u201d). As we shall see, the decisions in <i>McLoughlin</i> and <i>Page</i>, whilst seminal in their own right, have engendered difficulties which require clarification (in the case of the former) and even rejection (in the case of the latter) in the context of what the position in Singapore ought to be. We will elaborate upon these observations in due course.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is apposite, in the meantime, to note that there is a dearth of case law in Singapore with regard to claims in negligence for psychiatric harm. Indeed, there appears to be only one significant decision which has analysed the duty of care in this area of the tort of negligence in any detail \u2013 the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Pang Koi Fa v Lim Djoe Phing</i> <nobr>[1993] 3 SLR 317</nobr> (\u201c<i>Pang Koi Fa</i>\u201d), where the principles laid down in <i>McLoughlin</i> were applied. These principles were also applied in the Malaysian High Court decision of <i>Jub\u2019il bin Mohamed Taib Taral v Sunway Lagoon Sdn Bhd</i> <nobr>[2001] 6 MLJ 669</nobr>. There is an older Malaysian High Court decision, <i>Zainab Binti Ismail v Marimuthu</i> <nobr>[1955] MLJ 22</nobr>, where <i>Bourhill v Young</i> [1943] AC\u00a092 (\u201c<i>Bourhill</i>\u201d) and <i>Hambrook v Stokes Brothers</i> [1925] 1\u00a0KB 141 (\u201c<i>Hambrook</i>\u201d) were cited. There is also a more recent decision (also of the Singapore High Court), <i>Man Mohan Singh s/o Jothirambal Singh v Dilveer Singh Gill s/o Shokdarchan Singh</i> <nobr>[2007] 4 SLR 843</nobr>, where there was some discussion of the issue (an appeal against the High Court\u2019s decision is currently pending before this court).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would be appropriate, in our view, if we examine \u2013 in greater detail \u2013 the decisions of the House of Lords in both <i>McLoughlin</i> and <i>Page</i> before setting out what we consider the law in Singapore ought to be with regard to liability in negligence for psychiatric harm and how this legal framework relates to the approach and principles laid down in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>The decision in</em> McLoughlin</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>The decision itself</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the law preceding the House of Lords\u2019 decision in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) was not by any means a legal vacuum (see, for example, the (earlier) House of Lords decision of <i>Bourhill</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>)), as alluded to earlier (above at [23]), <i>McLoughlin</i> was a major landmark in the law relating to liability for negligence that had inflicted psychiatric harm on the victim/plaintiff. It represented a detailed (and up-to-date) analysis of the law and laid down further guidelines for the courts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fact situation in <i>McLoughlin</i>, which is important to note, was as follows. There was a tragic and horrendous road accident which involved the plaintiff\u2019s husband (\u201cMr\u00a0McLoughlin\u201d), who was driving, and three of her children. Another child (\u201cthe fourth child\u201d), travelling in a following car, was (fortunately) not involved in the accident. The collision was between the car driven by Mr\u00a0McLoughlin and a lorry driven by the first defendant (and owned by the second defendant). That particular lorry had, in fact, been in a collision with another lorry driven by the third defendant (and owned by the fourth defendant). It was admitted that the accident to the car driven by Mr\u00a0McLoughlin was caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0McLoughlin suffered bruising and shock. One child, a son aged 17 (\u201cthe first child\u201d), suffered injuries to his head and his face, cerebral concussion, fractures of both scapulae as well as bruising and abrasions. Another child, a daughter aged seven (\u201cthe second child\u201d), suffered concussion, a fracture of the right clavicle, bruising, abrasions and shock. A third child, a daughter who was nearly three years old (\u201cthe third child\u201d), was so seriously injured that she died almost immediately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff herself (\u201cMrs\u00a0McLoughlin\u201d) was at home at the time of the accident. This was about <i>two miles</i> from the scene of the accident. The person driving the car in which the fourth child (a son aged 11) was travelling reported the accident to Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin about <i>an hour or so later</i>. He told her that he thought that the first child was dying, and that he did not know the whereabouts of Mr\u00a0McLoughlin or the condition of her daughter. <i>He then drove her to the hospital</i> <i>to which her children and Mr\u00a0McLoughlin had been taken</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">30<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the hospital</i>, Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin met the fourth child (who had been in the other car, thereby escaping injury), who told her that the third child was dead. Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin was then taken down a corridor and, through a window, she saw the second child, who was crying, with her face cut and covered with dirt and oil. She could also hear the first child shouting and screaming. She was then taken to Mr\u00a0McLoughlin, who was sitting with his head in his hands and who was dishevelled and covered in mud and oil. He began sobbing when he saw Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin. The latter was then taken to see the first child, whose left face and left side were covered entirely. He appeared to recognise Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin, but then lapsed into unconsciousness. Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin was then taken to see the second child, who had by then been cleaned up. The latter was too upset to speak and simply clung on to Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin. As Lord\u00a0Wilberforce put it (see <i>McLoughlin</i> at 417):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">There can be no doubt that these circumstances, witnessed by the appellant [<i>ie</i>, Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin], were distressing in the extreme and were capable of producing an effect going well beyond that of grief and sorrow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin subsequently brought proceedings against the defendants. It is important to note that it was <i>assumed</i> by the trial judge that Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin was a person of reasonable fortitude and had indeed suffered the condition complained of, which was described by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce as \u201csevere shock, organic depression and a change of personality\u201d, with \u201c[n]umerous symptoms of a physiological character \u2026 manifested\u201d (<i>ibid</i>). The type of psychiatric harm which Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin claimed she had suffered is a not unimportant point, simply because a <i>threshold</i> requirement (as described by Lord\u00a0Bridge of Harwich in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) at 431) which must be satisfied before there can be recovery for psychiatric harm is that the claimant must have suffered from <i>a recognisable psychiatric illness</i> (though <i>cf</i> the terminology utilised in Australian legislation at [113] below).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge gave judgment in favour of the defendants, holding that they owed no duty of care to Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin because it was not reasonably foreseeable that she would suffer nervous shock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The English Court of Appeal affirmed the decision at first instance, albeit on somewhat different grounds. This was well-summarised by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce, as follows (<i>id</i> at 417):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Stephenson\u00a0L.J. took the view that the possibility of injury to the appellant by nervous shock <i>was</i> reasonably foreseeable and that the respondents [<i>ie</i>, the defendants] owed the appellant a duty of care. However, he held that considerations of policy prevented the appellant from recovering. Griffiths\u00a0L.J. held that injury by nervous shock to the appellant was \u201creadily foreseeable\u201d but that the respondents owed no duty of care to the appellant. The duty was limited to those on the road nearby. Cumming-Bruce\u00a0L.J. agreed with both judgments. [emphasis in original]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin then appealed to the House of Lords. Lord\u00a0Wilberforce set out, in succinct fashion, the fundamental issue in the case, as follows (<i>id</i> at 417\u2013418):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The critical question to be decided is whether a person in the position of the appellant, i.e. one who was not present at the scene of grievous injuries to her family but who comes upon those injuries at an interval of time and space, can recover damages for nervous shock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The House of Lords held in favour of Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin and therefore allowed the appeal. The leading judgment was, in fact, delivered by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce. Significantly, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce had earlier also laid down the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>). The observations made by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) will be set out in full not only because (as just mentioned) he delivered the leading judgment, but also because it is important, in our view, to clarify any terminological uncertainty that might be generated (particularly if we compare Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s observations in <i>McLoughlin</i> with his formulation of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>). Indeed, we shall demonstrate that Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s approach in <i>McLoughlin</i> towards ascertaining whether a defendant owed a duty of care was consistent with his approach in <i>Anns</i> and, consequently, with the approach that this court adopted in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>)<i>.</i> In order to proceed in the clearest way possible, we propose to divide Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s observations (which are important, albeit relatively lengthy) into three parts. Before proceeding to do so, however, we should note that two other law lords in <i>McLoughlin</i> arrived at the same result by adopting what was, in our view, a <i>much broader</i> approach. In particular, Lord\u00a0Bridge and Lord\u00a0Scarman applied a \u201cpure\u201d test of reasonable foreseeabilty without more (reference may also be made to the views of Thomas\u00a0J in the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision of <i>van Soest v Residual Health Management Unit</i> <nobr>[2000] 1 NZLR 179</nobr>, which may, in turn, be contrasted with the views of the other four judges in the same case, who adopted Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s approach in <i>McLoughlin</i> instead). With respect, the approach taken by Lord\u00a0Bridge and Lord\u00a0Scarman in <i>McLoughlin</i> is, in our view, too broad. As we shall see in a moment, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce added three factors which served to constrain the otherwise extensive liability that might result if a \u201cpure\u201d test of reasonable foreseeability alone were applied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s observations in</em> McLoughlin <em>(in three parts)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the <i>first part</i> (\u201c<i>Part\u00a01</i>\u201d) of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), Lord\u00a0Wilberforce observed thus (at 420\u2013421):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[A]t the margin, the boundaries of a man\u2019s responsibility for acts of negligence have to be fixed <i>as a matter of policy</i>. Whatever is the correct jurisprudential analysis, it does not make any essential difference whether one says, with Stephenson\u00a0L.J., that there is a duty but, as a matter of policy, the consequences of breach of it ought to be limited at a certain point, or whether, with Griffiths\u00a0L.J., one says that the fact that consequences may be foreseeable does not automatically impose a duty of care \u2026 [and] does not do so in fact where policy indicates the contrary. This is an approach which <i>one</i> <i>can see very clearly from the way in which Lord\u00a0Atkin stated the neighbour principle</i> in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> [1932] A.C.\u00a0562, 580: \u201cpersons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected. \u2026\u201d This is saying that <i>foreseeability must be accompanied and limited by</i> the <i>law\u2019s judgment</i> as to persons who ought, <i>according to its standards of value or justice</i>, to have been in [the defendant\u2019s] contemplation. <b><i>Foreseeability</i></b>, which involves a hypothetical person, looking with hindsight at an event which has occurred, is a formula adopted by English law, not merely for defining, but also for limiting, the persons to whom [a] duty may be owed, and the consequences for which an actor may be held responsible. <i>It is <b>not merely an issue of fact</b> to be left to be found as such</i>. When it is said to result in a duty of care being owed to a person or a class, <i>the statement that there is a \u201cduty of care\u201d denotes a conclusion into the forming of which considerations of policy have entered</i>. <b><i>That foreseeability does not of itself, and automatically, lead to a duty of care is, I think, clear</i>.</b> I gave some examples in <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</i> [1978] A.C.\u00a0728, 752, <i>Anns</i> itself being one. I may add what Lord\u00a0Reid said in <i>McKew</i> v. <i>Holland &amp; Hannen &amp; Cubitts (Scotland) Ltd.</i> [1969] 3\u00a0All\u00a0E.R. 1621, 1623:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">\u201cA defender is not liable for a consequence of a kind which is not foreseeable. But it does not follow that he is liable for every consequence which a reasonable man could foresee.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b><i>We must then consider the policy arguments</i></b>. In doing so we must bear in mind that cases of \u201cnervous shock,\u201d and the possibility of claiming damages for it, are not necessarily confined to those arising out of accidents on public roads. To state, therefore, a rule that recoverable damages must be confined to persons on or near the highway is to state not a principle in itself, but only an example of a more general rule that <i>recoverable damages must be confined to those within sight and sound of an event caused by negligence or, at least, to those in close, or very close, <b>proximity</b> to such a situation</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Wilberforce then proceeded, in the <i>second part</i> (\u201c<i>Part\u00a02</i>\u201d) of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i>, to enunciate what he viewed to be the \u201c<i>policy</i> arguments <i>against</i> a wider extension\u201d [emphasis added] (<i>id</i> at 421) of liability, as follows (<i>ibid</i>):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>The policy arguments against a wider extension</i> can be stated under <i>four heads.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>First, it may be said that such extension may lead to a proliferation of claims, and possibly fraudulent claims</i>, to the establishment of an industry of lawyers and psychiatrists who will formulate a claim for nervous shock damages, including what in America is called the customary miscarriage, for all, or many, road accidents and industrial accidents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>Secondly, it may be claimed that an extension of liability would be unfair to defendants, as imposing damages out of proportion to the negligent conduct complained of</i>. In so far as such defendants are insured, <i>a large additional burden will be placed on insurers, and ultimately upon the class of persons insured \u2013 road users or employers</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>Thirdly, to extend liability beyond the most direct and plain cases would greatly increase evidentiary difficulties and tend to lengthen litigation</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>Fourthly</i>, it may be said \u2013 and the Court of Appeal agreed with this \u2013 that <i>an extension of the scope of liability ought only to be made by the legislature, after careful research.</i> This is the course which has been taken in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The whole argument has been well summed up by Dean Prosser (<em>Prosser</em><em>,</em><em>Torts</em>, 4th\u00a0ed. (1971), p.\u00a0256):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">\u201cThe reluctance of the courts to enter this field even where the mental injury is clearly foreseeable, and the frequent mention of the difficulties of proof, the facility of fraud, and the problem of finding a place to stop and draw the line, suggest that here it is the nature of the interest invaded and the type of damage which is the real obstacle.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Since he wrote, the type of damage has, in this country at least, become more familiar and less deterrent to recovery. <i>And some of the arguments are susceptible of answer. Fraudulent claims can be contained by the courts, who, also, can cope with evidentiary difficulties. The scarcity of cases which have occurred in the past, and the modest sums recovered, give some indication that fears of a flood of litigation may be exaggerated \u2013 experience in other fields suggests that such fears usually are. If some increase does occur, that may only reveal the existence of a genuine social need: that legislation has been found necessary in Australia may indicate the same thing.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in the <i>third part</i> (\u201c<i>Part\u00a03</i>\u201d) of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i>, the learned law lord observed as follows (<i>id</i> at 421\u2013422):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><b><i>But, these discounts accepted, there remains</i></b>, in my opinion, just because \u201cshock\u201d in its nature is capable of affecting so wide a range of people,<b><i>a real need for the law to place some limitation upon the extent of admissible claims. It is necessary to consider three elements inherent in any claim: the class of persons</i></b> <i>whose claims should be recognised</i>; the <b><i>proximity</i></b> <i>of such persons</i> <b><i>to the accident; and the means by which the shock is caused.</i></b> As regards the class of persons, the possible range is between the closest of family ties \u2013 of parent and child, or husband and wife \u2013 and the ordinary bystander. Existing law recognises the claims of the first: it denies that of the second, either on the basis that such persons must be assumed to be possessed of fortitude sufficient to enable them to endure the calamities of modern life, or that defendants cannot be expected to compensate the world at large. In my opinion, these positions are justifiable, and since the present case falls within the first class, it is strictly unnecessary to say more. <i>I think, however, that it should follow that other cases involving less close relationships must be very carefully scrutinised. I cannot say that they should never be admitted. The closer the tie (not merely in relationship, but in care) the greater the claim for consideration.</i> <b><i>The claim, in any case, has to be judged in the light of the other factors, such as proximity to the scene in time and place, and the nature of the accident.</i></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>As regards <b>proximity</b> to the accident, it is obvious that this must be close in both time and space. It is, after all, the fact and consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence that must be proved to have caused the \u201cnervous shock.\u201d Experience has shown that to insist on direct and immediate sight or hearing would be impractical and unjust and that under what may be called <b>the \u201caftermath\u201d doctrine</b> one who, from <b>close proximity</b>, comes very soon upon the scene should not be excluded.</i> In my opinion, the result in <i>Benson</i> v. <i>Lee</i> [1972] V.\u00a0R.\u00a0879 was correct and indeed inescapable. It was based, soundly, upon</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">\u201cdirect perception of some of the events which go to make up the accident as an entire event, and this includes \u2026 the immediate aftermath \u2026\u201d (p.\u00a0880.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The High Court\u2019s majority decision in <i>Chester</i> v. <i>Waverley Corporation</i> (1939) 62\u00a0C.L.R. 1, where a child\u2019s body was found floating in a trench after a prolonged search, may perhaps be placed on the other side of a recognisable line (Evatt\u00a0J. in a powerful dissent placed it on the same side), but, in addition, I find the conclusion of Lush\u00a0J. [in <i>Benson v Lee</i>] to reflect developments in the law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Finally, and by way of reinforcement of \u201caftermath\u201d cases, I would accept, by analogy with \u201crescue\u201d situations, that a person of whom it could be said that one could expect nothing else than that he or she would come immediately to the scene \u2013 normally a parent or a spouse \u2013 could be regarded as being within the scope of foresight and duty. Where there is not immediate presence, account must be taken of the possibility of alterations in the circumstances, for which the defendant should not be responsible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>Subject only to these qualifications, I think that a strict test of <b>proximity</b> by sight or hearing should be applied by the courts.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>Lastly, as regards communication, there is no case in which the law has compensated shock brought about by communication by a third party.</i> In <i>Hambrook v. Stokes Brothers</i> [1925] 1\u00a0K.B. 141, indeed, it was said that liability would not arise in such a case and this is surely right. It was so decided in <i>Abramzik</i> v. <i>Brenner</i> (1967) 65\u00a0D.L.R. (2d)\u00a0651. <i>The shock must come through sight or hearing of the event or of its immediate aftermath. Whether some equivalent of sight or hearing, e.g. through simultaneous television, would suffice may have to be considered.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s observations considered</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">39<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part\u00a01</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) (reproduced above at [36]) is instructive in several ways. In its most <i>general</i> sense, this portion of the learned law lord\u2019s judgment not only reaffirms his earlier views in <i>Anns</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) at 751\u2013752 (reproduced above at [20]), but also (and more importantly) supports and is consistent with the views of this court in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>), as reproduced above at [21]. These views constitute, in fact, the <i>general foundation</i> upon which a duty of care in claims in negligence for non-physical injury (including psychiatric harm) is based. Briefly, these views include the following:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court needs to draw clear <i>boundaries to (or place limits on)</i> liability in negligence for non-physical injury in order to ensure that such liability does not become indeterminate and/or arbitrary. As Prof\u00a0Tan Keng Feng aptly points out (see Tan Keng Feng, \u201cLiability for Psychiatric Illness \u2013 The English Law Commission\u201d (1999) 7\u00a0Tort Law Rev 165 (\u201cLiability for Psychiatric Illness\u201d)), there is <i>no</i> difficulty in so far as <i>physical</i> injury is concerned as the <i>very nature</i> of the injury <i>itself</i> constitutes the necessary boundary or limitation (which he terms the \u201cphysical impact limit\u201d (<i>id</i> at 166)). It should also be noted that this court in <i>Spandeck</i> was of the view (at [64] and [70]\u2013[72]) that there should not be different tests for determining whether a duty of care exists in cases of physical injury on the one hand and cases of non-physical injury on the other. Most importantly, perhaps, such boundaries or limits are drawn by the court as a matter of <i>policy</i>. <i>However</i>, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s reference to \u201cpolicy\u201d in <i>McLoughlin</i> will (as we shall see below) require some <i>clarification</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mere <i>factual</i> foreseeability, whilst a necessary condition or prerequisite to establish a duty of care, is <i>not</i> (<i>in and of itself</i>) sufficient (see <i>Spandeck</i> at [75]\u2013[76]).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Proximity</i> between the plaintiff and the defendant is <i>also</i> a <i>condition or prerequisite</i> which must be satisfied in order to establish a duty of care (<i>id</i> at [77]) and, to this end, <i>policy</i> arguments must be considered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before proceeding to consider <i>Part\u00a02</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> in more detail <i>and</i> in its <i>context</i>, an important clarification of the learned law lord\u2019s use of the concept of \u201c<i>policy</i>\u201d (at, <i>inter alia</i>, 421) is not only instructive, but also necessary in order to avoid the very real confusion that would otherwise result. Indeed, the danger of such confusion reminds us of the famous (and oft-cited) words of Burrough\u00a0J in the leading English decision of <i>Richardson v Mellish</i> (1824) 2\u00a0Bing 229; 130\u00a0ER 294 (at 252; 303) that public policy is:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[A] very unruly horse, and when once you get astride it you never know where it will carry you. It may lead you from the sound law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It is, of course, true that the ebullient Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR was, in comparison, more sanguine when he observed in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Enderby Town Football Club Ltd v Football Association Ltd</i> [1971] Ch\u00a0591 (at 606) that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">With a good man in the saddle, the unruly horse can be kept in control. It can jump over obstacles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It is, nevertheless, clear that the concept of \u201cpublic policy\u201d is not an easy one and the court must be vigilant to ensure that it is properly conceived as well as properly applied. In the specific context of the present appeal, let us elaborate on how possible confusion can, in fact, be avoided.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The key to avoiding the possible confusion referred to in the preceding paragraph is to recognise that there are <i>different conceptions</i> of the <i>concept</i> of \u201c<i>policy</i>\u201d. Indeed, the concept of \u201c<i>public</i> policy\u201d referred to in that very same paragraph is but <i>one</i> conception of the concept of \u201cpolicy\u201d.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we shall illustrate in a moment, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce was, in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), referring to <i>two different conceptions</i> of the concept of \u201c<i>policy</i>\u201d.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>first</i> conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d does <i>not</i> refer to \u201c<i>public</i> policy\u201d as such. It is, rather, a reference to the <i>factors</i> that must be taken into account as between <i>the parties</i> to a negligence action (which constitute, in our view, an example of \u201c<i>legal</i> policy\u201d [emphasis added] as referred to in the House of Lords decision of <i>McFarlane v Tayside Health Board</i> [2000]\u00a02\u00a0AC 59 at 108, <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Millett). In particular, these factors will ensure that there is sufficient <i>proximity</i> between the parties. Indeed, as this court emphasised in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i> at [77]), <i>proximity</i> is the key <i>legal</i> focus in so far as the <i>first stage</i> of the two-stage test established therein is concerned. Looked at in this light, we would respectfully suggest that it is preferable (from both theoretical as well as practical points of view) <i>to avoid the use of the term \u201cpolicy\u201d altogether</i> when discussing <i>legal</i> policy and to refer, instead, to the concept of \u201c<i>proximity</i>\u201d. In other words, the term \u201cpolicy\u201d should be reserved exclusively for use in the context of \u201c<i>public</i> policy\u201d.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>second</i> conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d refers, as just mentioned, to \u201c<i>public</i> policy\u201d. Put simply, this particular conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d does <i>not</i> refer to the relationship between <i>the parties</i> as such (which, as we have emphasised in the preceding paragraph, is more appropriately characterised as well as analysed under the rubric of \u201c<i>proximity</i>\u201d), but refers, instead, to <i>broader societal</i> considerations. It is <i>this</i> particular conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d that constitutes the <i>second</i> stage of the two-stage test laid down by this court in <i>Spandeck</i>. In <i>Spandeck</i> itself, Chan\u00a0CJ elaborated upon this particular conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d, as follows (at [83]\u2013[85]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Assuming a positive answer to the preliminary question of factual foreseeability and the first stage of the legal proximity test, a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care arises. Policy considerations should then be applied to the factual matrix to determine whether or not to negate this duty. Among the relevant policy considerations would be, for example, the presence of a contractual matrix which has clearly defined the rights and liabilities of the parties and the relative bargaining positions of the parties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also recognise that the obvious objection to utilising policy as the overarching determinant of liability is its potential to result in arbitrary decisions. Although it is generally recognised that public policy is an unruly horse (<i>per</i> Burrough\u00a0J in <i>Richardson v Mellish</i> (1824) 2\u00a0Bing 229 at 252; 130\u00a0ER 294 at 303), it cannot be <i>completely</i> ignored. The danger is <i>not</i> with judges deciding cases based on policy considerations but rather with judges deciding cases based <i>solely</i> on them. We agree with [Prof\u00a0Tan Keng Feng, \u201cThe Three-Part Test: Yet Another Test of Duty in Negligence\u201d (1989) 31\u00a0Mal\u00a0L\u00a0Rev 223 at 228] that \u201c[t]he truth lies somewhere in between pure principle-based decisions and policy-based decisions\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is obviously impossible to decide cases <i>in vacuo</i>, exclusive of the interests and the context of the community for which the decisions are made\u201d. In our view, it is inescapable that some measure of public policy must be considered but it must not be the sole determinant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would also caution that when applying policy considerations to negate the imposition of a duty of care, the courts must be careful to differentiate such considerations from the requirement of proximity in the first stage of the test we have articulated. The courts must, as far as possible, avoid giving the impression that there remain \u201cunexpressed motives\u201d behind their finding for or against a duty. The courts must also not have litigants believe, as J\u00a0A\u00a0Smillie put it in \u201cThe Foundation of the Duty of Care in Negligence\u201d (1989) 15\u00a0Monash U\u00a0L\u00a0Rev\u00a0302 at 302, that \u201cnone of [the tests articulated by the courts] is truly explanatory of judges\u2019 reasoning or provides a helpful framework for analysis of the duty question\u201d. If there is truly a <i>pertinent and relevant</i> policy consideration involving value judgments which reflect differential weighing and balancing of competing moral claims and broad social welfare goals, we feel that it would be better if the courts were to articulate these concerns under the requirement of policy considerations, rather than subsume these concerns within the proximity requirement, which may then lead to an overall distortion of the legal test to determine the existence of a duty of care. In this respect, we agree with Nicholas J\u00a0Mullany when he notes in \u201cProximity, Policy and Procrastination\u201d (1992) 9\u00a0Aust Bar Rev 80 at 83 that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">Judges should openly express the true premises of their decisions and, if recovery is considered to be undeserved, in the light of greater moral, social, economic, administrative or philosophical public perceptions, then these reasons and not others inherently uncertain in nature, should be expressed as the true foundation for denial of recovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce did <i>not</i>, with respect, distinguish between the two conceptions of \u201cpolicy\u201d referred to earlier (above at [43]\u2013[44]). For example, in <i>Part\u00a01</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> (reproduced above at [36]), the learned law lord was, in point of fact, referring to the <i>first</i> conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d, <i>viz</i>, <i>legal</i> policy (or, to use the preferred term (see [43] above), <i>proximity</i>). <i>However</i>, in <i>Part\u00a02</i> of his judgment in the same case (reproduced above at [37]), Lord\u00a0Wilberforce appeared to be referring to aspects of the <i>second</i> conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d, <i>viz</i>, <i>public</i> policy, instead. That <i>Part\u00a02</i> of his judgment <i>follows immediately from Part\u00a01</i> of the same judgment serves only to exacerbate the confusion in so far as the various conceptions of \u201cpolicy\u201d are concerned. It is admitted, however, that because the line between the universal and the particular (see the correlation between the two as pointed out by this court in <i>Spandeck</i> at [28]) is, by its very nature, not always clear (and may even be blurred), the opportunities for confusion are (unfortunately) multiplied. Nevertheless, a clear reading of <i>Part\u00a02</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> does, in fact, suggest (on <i>balance</i>) that it was the <i>second</i> (and <i>broader</i>) aspect of (<i>public</i>) \u201cpolicy\u201d that the learned law lord was referring to. That this is the correct interpretation to adopt is <i>confirmed</i>, <i>in no uncertain terms</i>, <i>by Part\u00a03</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment in the same case \u2013 to which our attention must now turn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">46<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part\u00a03</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment (reproduced above at [38]) is, in fact, the <i>most important</i> part of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>). It is, indeed, <i>this</i> particular part of the judgment that is cited most often. This is not surprising in view of the fact that the learned law lord set out in <i>Part\u00a03</i>, in detail, the \u201cthree elements\u201d (<i>id</i> at 422) which the court ought to consider in every claim founded on negligence that has resulted in <i>nervous shock</i>. Indeed, as already noted (above at [24]), these three elements were considered and applied by the <i>Singapore</i> High Court (in <i>Pang Koi Fa</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>)).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Part\u00a03</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i>, the three elements referred to are clearly part of the first (and <i>narrower</i>) conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d, <i>viz</i>, <i>legal</i> policy, which (as we have noted above at [43]) relates to the issue of <i>proximity</i> between <i>the parties</i> themselves. The learned law lord, in fact, <i>expressly stated</i> that this was so. He referred to the concept of \u201cproximity\u201d no fewer than five times in this part of his judgment. Indeed, he stated at 422 (see the passage reproduced above at [38]) that \u201c[t]he claim \u2026 ha[d] to be judged in the light of the other factors, such as <i>proximity</i> to the scene in time and place, and the nature of the accident\u201d [emphasis added]. It is also extremely significant, in our view, that <i>Part\u00a03</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment <i>follows immediately from Part\u00a02</i> of the same judgment, where (as we noted above at [45]) there is a clear reference to the <i>second</i> (and <i>broader</i>) conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d, <i>viz</i>, <i>public</i> policy. Indeed, the contrast between the second and the first conceptions of \u201cpolicy\u201d, <i>as embodied within Part\u00a02 and Part\u00a03 (respectively)</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i>, could not be clearer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The upshot of the above analysis is that the apparent \u201cpolicy\u201d factors referred to by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> are, <i>in substance</i>, factors that relate to <i>proximity</i> between <i>the parties</i> instead. There would remain residuary \u201cpolicy\u201d factors that are, in our view, \u201ctrue\u201d policy factors inasmuch as they relate to <i>public</i> policy and thus fall within the purview of the <i>second</i> conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d. It will be seen that both these aforementioned stages of legal analysis \u2013 <i>ie</i>, consideration of, first, proximity, followed by public policy \u2013 <i>correspond precisely to the two-stage test set out by this court</i> in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>) (reproduced above at [21]). In other words \u2212 and this is an extremely important point \u2013 the two-stage test laid down in <i>Spandeck</i> is <i>equally</i> applicable to a situation where there is a claim in negligence for psychiatric harm. There is therefore no need for a <i>separate</i> legal regime governing such a claim. It will be explained, further, <i>why</i> the two-stage test in <i>Spandeck</i> <i>should</i> be the legal approach that is to be adopted in <i>all</i> types of claims in negligence in <i>the Singapore context</i> in so far as establishing a legal duty of care on the part of the defendant is concerned. At this stage, it will suffice to state that such an approach, whilst simple, is by no means simplistic. On the contrary, it brings certainty to a much vexed (albeit extremely important) area of the law of tort that has engendered many difficulties, both confused and confusing, across Commonwealth jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>A comparison of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s observations in</em> McLoughlin <em>and in</em> Anns</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this juncture, it remains for us to consider the possibility that, as a result of the approach which Lord\u00a0Wilberforce took in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), the two-stage test which he laid down in <i>Anns</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) at 751\u2013752 (reproduced above at [20]) must now be reinterpreted as referring to <i>factual</i> foreseeability at the <i>first</i> stage, followed (at the <i>second</i> stage) by \u201c<i>policy</i>\u201d considerations in the <i>narrower</i> (and <i>first</i>) conception of \u201cpolicy\u201d, which (as we saw above at [43] and [45]) relates to <i>proximity</i>. We do not, however, think that this is what the learned law lord intended or meant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the first place, our analysis earlier (above at [42]\u2013[47]) clearly demonstrates that Lord\u00a0Wilberforce was referring to <i>two separate and distinct</i> conceptions of \u201cpolicy\u201d in <i>McLoughlin</i>. This, in all likelihood, means that he similarly had these two distinct conceptions of \u201cpolicy\u201d in mind when enunciating his two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, and on an even more important as well as closely-related note, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce referred, in <i>his very formulation</i> of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> itself, to the requirement, at the <i>first</i> stage, of \u201ca sufficient relationship of <i>proximity</i> or neighbourhood\u201d [emphasis added] (see <i>Anns</i> at 751).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thirdly, at least one subsequent House of Lords decision has adopted the interpretation of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment which we have advocated. In <i>Alcock</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), the court treated the three factors enunciated by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) as falling within the sphere of <i>proximity</i> instead (<i>viz</i>, the first stage of the two-stage test set out in <i>Anns</i> (reproduced above at [20]) and in <i>Spandeck</i> (reproduced above at [21])). Amarjeet Singh\u00a0JC put it well in <i>Pang Koi Fa</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>), as follows (at 326, [33]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The additional consideration applied by their Lordships [in <i>Alcock</i>] was that of the \u2018relationship of proximity\u2019 according to the three proximities applied by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <em>McLoughlin</em>, <i>but unlike Lord\u00a0Wilberforce, their application of the three proximities was not a consideration of policy which limits the classes of cases where liability may be established.</i> Instead, their considerations of the three proximities were as a means of conditioning the duty of care, a further limitation to the existence and scope of the duty. In other words, <i>instead of considering the proximities as limitations to the classes where as a matter of policy, recovery may be permitted, the proximities were legal requirements defining the classes wherein recovery may be permitted, barring the additional considerations of justice and reasonableness</i>. As <i>legal</i> requirements, the threshold for their fulfilment is thus a <i>legal</i> threshold, and the extension of liability would be on an incremental basis by analogy with established categories, rather than on general principles of reasonable foreseeability. The parameters of the scope of the duty to avoid inflicting nervous shock had thus been redefined. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, and on the equally important level of general principle and development of the law in this difficult area, the approach which this court adopted in <i>Spandeck</i> (reproduced above at [21]) serves, simultaneously, to reconcile the <i>substance</i> of what appear to be rather inconsistent approaches (particularly under English law).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is, in the circumstances, <i>highly unlikely</i> that Lord\u00a0Wilberforce was referring to only <i>factual</i> foreseeability (<i>instead of proximity</i>) in the <i>first</i> stage of his two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>. If he was (and, as just mentioned, we do not think that this was the case in the first place), we must, respectfully, <i>disagree</i> with such an approach. However, it is vitally important to point out that, <i>even if</i> the <i>first</i> stage of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> is taken as referring to <i>factual</i> foreseeability <i>only</i>, <i>nothing</i> of <i>substance</i> would turn on it because, as this court explained in <i>Spandeck</i>, there must, in principle as well as in logic, justice and fairness, be a <i>holistic and integrated</i> analysis of the relevant factual matrix <i>both</i> from the perspective of <i>proximity</i> (as between <i>the parties</i>) <i>and</i> from the perspective of <i>public</i> policy (on a <i>broader societal</i> level). The latter may operate to exclude a duty of care for the purposes of the tort of negligence <i>even if</i> the situation concerned passes legal muster under the former (inasmuch as there is otherwise <i>proximity</i> between the parties in law).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>), this court was clearly aware of the possible difficulties surrounding the meaning of the first stage of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>. As Chan\u00a0CJ put it (<i>id</i> at [34]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">It is well known that there is some controversy regarding the meaning of the first stage of the test: Did it relate only to the <i>factual</i> issue of reasonable foreseeability <i>or</i> did it introduce the <i>legal</i> conception of proximity \u2026 ? [emphasis in original]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The response to the question posed in the preceding paragraph was clear and unambiguous to this court. Chan\u00a0CJ observed thus (<i>id</i> at [75]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">As we mentioned earlier (see [34] above), there is <i>some controversy</i> in relation to <i>the interpretation of the first stage</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s test in <i>Anns</i>, <i>ie</i>, whether it refers to mere factual foreseeability or legal foreseeability or proximity. <i>In our view, factual foreseeability is too wide a criterion to be effective as a legal control mechanism if all that it means is that the defendant ought to have known that the claimant would suffer damage from his (the defendant\u2019s) carelessness. If this is the approach to be adopted, it would be fulfilled in almost all cases, because the two parties are likely to be in some degree of physical relationship in the relevant case.</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>Summary of our analysis of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s observations in</em> McLoughlin</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, a close analysis of the observations of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) (in the context of his earlier enunciation of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>)) reveals that his statements of principle in both of these cases are consistent with what this court decided in <i>Spandeck</i> (which adopted a two-stage test, with (legal) foreseeability or proximity as the focus at the first stage and (broader) public policy as the focus at the second stage) to the extent that the three factors set out in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of the learned law lord\u2019s judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> are an integral part of the <i>first</i> stage of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>, which formed the basis of the (likewise) two-stage test laid down in <i>Spandeck</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to consider the second major House of Lords decision, <i>viz</i>, <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>The decision in</em> Page</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>The decision itself</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The decision in <i>Page</i> was another major legal landmark in the law relating to liability in negligence for psychiatric harm. In that case, the House of Lords drew a clear distinction <i>between primary and secondary victims</i>. This distinction had, in fact, been drawn in earlier cases (for instance, <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Oliver of Aylmerton in <i>Alcock</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) at 407). However, <i>Page</i> not only brought this distinction to the fore, but also elaborated upon it in some detail. More importantly, the House of Lords held in <i>Page</i> that where the plaintiff was the <i>primary</i> victim, he or she was entitled to recovery against the defendant <i>even when</i> the <i>psychiatric</i> harm suffered was <i>not reasonably foreseeable</i> by the latter <i>\u2013 provided that physical</i> injury to the plaintiff (which he or she <i>apprehended</i> <i>and</i> which need <i>not</i> have <i>actually occurred</i>) <i>was foreseeable and the apprehension of such physical injury resulted in the psychiatric harm</i>. Indeed, in <i>Page</i> itself, <i>physical</i> injury, whilst <i>foreseeable</i>, did <i>not</i>, in fact, <i>actually occur</i>. <i>Nevertheless</i>, it was held (consistent with the general principle just set out) that the plaintiff in that case (\u201cMr\u00a0Page\u201d) was <i>entitled to recover</i> against the defendant in that case (\u201cMr\u00a0Smith\u201d) for the <i>psychiatric</i> illness that ensued as a consequence of the collision between their cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is significant, in our view, that the decision in <i>Page</i> was <i>not a unanimous one</i>. Indeed, it was a decision based on the barest of majorities \u2013 three to two. As we shall see in a moment, the two dissenting judgments were not unpersuasive. More importantly, perhaps, we find, with respect, significant difficulties with the decision of the majority. Looked at in this light, it is important to proceed to consider these judgments in more detail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of factual background, there was, in <i>Page</i>, a motor accident in July 1987. Mr\u00a0Page was driving his car along a road when Mr\u00a0Smith, driving in the opposite direction, cut across his (Mr\u00a0Page\u2019s) path whilst entering a side road. A collision occurred in which Mr\u00a0Page sustained <i>no</i> <i>physical injury</i>. There was also no physical injury sustained by either Mr\u00a0Smith, his wife or his child, who were passengers in his car. Put simply, this was <i>a minor</i> motor accident (although there was considerable damage to both vehicles). However, Mr\u00a0Page had, for a very long time, suffered from a condition known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (\u201cME\u201d) (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome). He had suffered a particularly severe attack of ME some four months earlier (in March 1987) as a result of a viral infection. Prior to the accident, he had been recovering from that attack and had hoped to return to work in September 1987. Mr\u00a0Page brought an action against Mr\u00a0Smith for damages for personal injuries caused by the latter\u2019s negligence. He argued that his condition (relating to ME) had become chronic and permanent as a result of the accident and that he would never be able to work again. According to Mr\u00a0Page, he had felt exhausted three hours after the accident and had taken to his bed, whereupon the exhaustion continued and his condition became chronic and permanent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The House of Lords, as mentioned earlier (above at [59]), found in favour of Mr\u00a0Page, but only (as was noted above at [60]) by a bare majority of three to two. We turn now to consider the various judgments delivered by the court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning, first, to the judgments delivered by the majority, the leading judgment was delivered by Lord\u00a0Lloyd of Berwick (with whom Lord\u00a0Ackner and Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson agreed). The learned law lord drew a (crucial) distinction between a primary victim on the one hand and a secondary victim on the other. In <i>Page</i>, the facts related to a <i>primary</i> victim and the basic issue before the court was whether or not the <i>foreseeability</i> of <i>physical</i> injury (<i>as opposed to psychiatric</i> injury) to Mr\u00a0Page was sufficient to enable him to recover damages for nervous shock (bearing in mind that there had been <i>no actual physical</i> injury to Mr\u00a0Page himself).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Lloyd was of the view that \u201c[t]hough the distinction between primary and secondary victims [was] a <i>factual</i> one, it ha[d] \u2026 important <i>legal</i> consequences\u201d [emphasis added] (<i>Page</i> at 184). However, in our view, with respect, this merely <i>factual</i> distinction does <i>not, in and of itself,</i> translate into a <i>legal</i> distinction in the absence of <i>a normative legal justification</i>. Lord\u00a0Lloyd did observe that foreseeability of <i>psychiatric</i> harm was relevant only <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> <i>secondary</i> victims. However, in so far as <i>primary</i> victims were concerned, since foreseeability of <i>physical injury</i> was sufficient to found a duty of care on the part of the defendant, <i>and</i> given the fact that no distinction ought to be drawn between physical and psychiatric injury (given the expansion in the state of medical knowledge), there was no need for a plaintiff who was a primary victim to demonstrate (further) that <i>psychiatric</i> injury was also foreseeable. This last-mentioned legal control mechanism ought only to apply to <i>secondary</i> victims. In the learned law lord\u2019s words (<i>id</i> at 190):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">There is no justification for regarding physical and psychiatric injury as different \u201ckinds\u201d of injury. Once it is established that the defendant is under a duty of care to avoid causing personal injury to the plaintiff, it matters not whether the injury in fact sustained is physical, psychiatric or both.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning, next, to the judgments delivered by the minority, Lord\u00a0Keith of Kinkel was of the view (<i>id</i> at 169) that \u201c[r]easonable foreseeablility being the test, there [was] no logical ground for distinguishing between the two classes of claimants [<i>ie</i>, primary victims and secondary victims]\u201d. Lord\u00a0Jauncey of Tullichettle, who was the other dissenting judge, observed thus (<i>id</i> at 171\u2013172):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">When a plaintiff suffers damage as a result of the negligent act of another he must establish foreseeability of the general type of damage before he can succeed. The fact that personal injury is a likely consequence will not support a claim for pure economic loss. In the normal personal injury case arising from a factory or road accident the foreseeability of such injury arising from the negligent act seldom requires to be addressed since it is self evident from the circumstances. However that is not to say that the need for it is dispensed with. It is by no means impossible that a plaintiff could be directly involved in an accident caused by a negligent act where the circumstances required specific proof that injury was foreseeable. In <i>Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co. Ltd. (The Wagon Mound)</i> [1961] A.C.\u00a0388, 426, the judgment of the Board contained the following observations:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">\u201cTheir Lordships conclude this part of the case with some general observations. They have been concerned primarily to displace the proposition that unforeseeability is irrelevant if damage is \u2018direct.\u2019 In doing so they have inevitably insisted that the essential factor in determining liability is whether the damage is of such a kind as the reasonable man should have foreseen. This accords with the general view thus stated by Lord\u00a0Atkin in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> [1932] A.C.\u00a0562, 580: \u2018The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of \u201cculpa,\u201d is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay.\u2019 It is a departure from this sovereign principle if liability is made to depend solely on the damage being the \u2018direct\u2019 or \u2018natural\u2019 consequence of the precedent act. Who knows or can be assumed to know all the processes of nature?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">If therefore a plaintiff who is directly involved in an accident [is] require[d] to establish that the physical injuries sustained by him were the foreseeable consequences of a negligent act it is not easy to see in principle why such a plaintiff who suffers merely nervous shock and its consequences should not [be] require[d] to prove that it [<i>ie</i>, nervous shock] was similarly foreseeable. As a matter of common sense physical injuries are far more likely to result from an impact accident than is nervous shock causing subsequent illness. While it is not uncommon for a severe physical injury to give rise to some degree of psychiatric illness it is not the law that such illness is presumed to be a foreseeable consequence of every physical injury, rather \u2026 each case depend[s] on its own circumstances. If therefore the foreseeability of psychiatric illness consequent upon physical injury [is] require[d] to be established independently of the foreseeability of the physical injury why should the position be different where there was at the most a risk of physical injury which never eventuated?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">The learned law lord also observed, later in his judgment, thus (<i>id</i> at 175):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[F]oreseeability of injury is necessary to determine whether a duty is owed to the victim. Unless such injury can be foreseen the victim is not a neighbour within the celebrated dictum of Lord\u00a0Atkin in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> [1932] A.C.\u00a0562 and cannot recover.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>Criticisms of the majority\u2019s approach</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As alluded to earlier (above at [60]), we find, with respect, the decision of the majority in <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) to be problematic for a number of reasons. Indeed, many of them are to be found in the characteristically perceptive judgment of Lord\u00a0Goff of Chieveley in the House of Lords decision of <i>White</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>). Whilst the learned law lord dissented in that particular decision, his criticisms of <i>Page</i> (being, strictly speaking, <i>obiter dicta</i>) were not commented on adversely by his brethren.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Goff was of the view that there were three broad grounds of criticism in respect of the majority\u2019s decision in <i>Page</i>. His observations in this regard merit (because of their importance) extensive quotation, as follows (<i>White</i> at 475\u2013476):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">In summary the basic grounds of criticism appear to be threefold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There has been no previous support for any such approach, and there is authority in England and Australia to the contrary. \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The approach favoured by Lord\u00a0Lloyd [in <i>Page</i>] appears to be inconsistent not only with the adoption by Viscount\u00a0Simonds in <i>The Wagon Mound No.\u00a01</i> [1961] A.C.\u00a0388, 426, of Denning\u00a0L.J.\u2019s statement of principle [in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>King v Phillips</i> [1953] 1\u00a0QB 429], but also with the actual reasoning of the Privy Council in that case [<i>ie</i>, <i>The Wagon Mound No.\u00a01</i>]. There a particular type of damage to property, viz. damage by fire, was differentiated from other types of damage to property for the purpose of deciding whether the defendant could reasonably have foreseen damage of that particular type, so as to render him liable in damages in tort for such damage. That differentiation was made on purely common sense grounds, as a matter of practical justice. On exactly the same grounds, a particular type of personal injury, viz. psychiatric injury, may, for the like purpose, properly be differentiated from other types of personal injury. It appears to be in no way inconsistent with the making of that common sense judgment, as a matter of practical justice, that scientific advances are revealing that psychiatric illnesses may have a physical base, or that psychiatric injury should be regarded as another form of personal injury. Moreover the absence of any previous challenge to the general application of the principle stated by Denning\u00a0L.J., and adopted by Viscount\u00a0Simonds, perhaps provides the strongest endorsement of that common sense judgment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The majority in <i>Page v. Smith</i> [1996] A.C.\u00a0155 may have misunderstood the so-called eggshell skull rule. In the course of his opinion, Lord\u00a0Lloyd said, at p.\u00a0187:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-3\"><span class=\"Judg-quote-2Char\">\u201cWe now know that the plaintiff escaped without external injury. Can it be the law that this makes all the difference? Can it be the law that the fortuitous absence of actual physical injury means that a different test has to be applied?</span>\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">These rhetorical questions Lord\u00a0Lloyd answered in the negative. Yet the effect of the \u201ceggshell skull\u201d rule, i.e. the rule that a wrongdoer must take his victim as he finds him, is that the absence (or, more accurately, the presence) of physical injury to the plaintiff, may make all the difference. Lord\u00a0Lloyd said, at p.\u00a0193:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-3\">\u201cThere is nothing in <i>Bourhill v. Young</i> [[24] <i>supra</i>] to displace the ordinary rule that where the plaintiff is within the range of foreseeable physical injury the defendant must take his victim as he finds him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">However, it appears from the passage from Lord\u00a0Wright\u2019s opinion in <i>Bourhill v. Young</i> [1943] A.C.\u00a092, 109\u2013110 \u2026 [<i>viz</i>, Lord\u00a0Wright\u2019s statement that \u201cif the wrong is established the wrongdoer must take the victim as he finds him\u201d] that that is not the ordinary rule. The maxim only applies where liability has been established. The criticism is therefore that Lord\u00a0Lloyd appears to have taken an exceptional rule relating to compensation and treated it as being of general application, thereby creating a wider principle of liability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">I recognise that the impact of this new statement of principle [in <i>Page</i>] is likely to be relatively slight, in that it does no more than extend liability for psychiatric damage to those cases where physical damage is reasonably foreseeable (though none is suffered) but psychiatric damage is not. In any event, however, this situation does not arise in the present appeals, since none of the claimants was within the range of foreseeable physical injury; and your Lordships do not therefore have to form a view about the validity of the criticisms which I have summarised above. Your Lordships can therefore proceed on the basis that, for the purposes of the present appeals, the relevant test is, as in the past, the test of foreseeability of psychiatric damage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would gratefully adopt the reasoning of Lord\u00a0Goff set out in the preceding paragraph, and add some observations of our own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leaving aside the issue of precedent (which was Lord\u00a0Goff\u2019s first point, and a not unimportant one at that), the basic difficulty centres on the issue of <i>characterisation</i>. The basic thrust of the approach of the majority in <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) was as follows. The court ought not now to distinguish between physical injury on the one hand and psychiatric harm on the other. In the premises, if physical injury was foreseeable, then even if no actual physical injury resulted, the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for any psychiatric injury inasmuch as such injury would be considered as part of the <i>extent</i> of the <i>physical</i> injury suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence pursuant to the \u201ceggshell skull rule\u201d.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, the premises upon which the majority in <i>Page</i> based their arguments are flawed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst there ought not now to be an artificial distinction between physical injury on the one hand and psychiatric harm on the other in relation to the applicable test for determining whether a duty of care exists, it is clear that there nevertheless ought still to exist a distinction from the perspective of <i>legal control mechanisms to prevent a floodgate of litigation ensuing</i>. In other words, physical injury in the conventional sense (which excludes psychiatric harm) delimits, by its <i>very nature</i>, the extent of liability owed by the defendant concerned to potential plaintiffs. Put simply, the danger of a floodgate of litigation ensuing is minimal or non-existent where physical injury is concerned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contrast the situation where physical injury occurs, however, with two other situations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first relates to cases of <i>pure economic loss</i>. This court in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>) has dealt with (the legal rules and principles relating to) this particular type of loss comprehensively (see above at [21]).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second, which is one of the important issues in the present appeal, relates to negligence that results in <i>psychiatric harm</i>. <i>Not unlike pure economic</i> loss, the <i>potential reach</i> of a negligent act or statement that may cause <i>psychiatric harm</i> is potentially <i>open-ended</i>. <i>Unlike</i> the situation where <i>physical illness or injury</i> is caused (where the extent of the damage is <i>necessarily limited in space and time</i>, as noted above at [71]), this is <i>not</i> the situation with regard to <i>psychiatric harm</i> (and explains the increasingly stringent approach adopted by the House of Lords, particularly in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), <i>Alcock</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) and <i>White</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>)). In this regard, the following observations by Prof\u00a0Tan Keng Feng in Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, <i>Discussion Paper on Liability for Negligently Inflicted Psychiatric Illness</i> (22\u00a0August 2000) (\u201c<i>Discussion Paper</i>\u201d) at pp\u00a02\u20133 should also be noted (a similar passage by the same author also appears in \u201cLiability for Psychiatric Illness\u201d ([39] <i>supra</i>) at 167):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The most cogent reason, however, for limiting liability for psychiatric illness is the fear of opening the floodgates of litigation. \u2026 <i>Non-impact psychiatric illness undoubtedly induces wider claims than impact physical damage</i>. It is better to accept some inevitable arbitrariness in drawing a line somewhere on \u2026 liability for psychiatric illness than to endure unmanageable chaos [resulting] from \u2026 unfettered recovery [for] such damage. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Tony Weir, in his review of Nicholas J\u00a0Mullany &amp; Peter R\u00a0Handford, <i>Mullany and Handford\u2019s Tort Liability for Psychiatric Damage: The Law of \u201cNervous Shock\u201d</i> (Lawbook Co Ltd, 1993) <em>at <nobr>[1993] CLJ 520</nobr>, stated, in a similar vein, thus (at 521):</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><em>Vulnerability to physical lesion is pretty standard throughout the population \u2013 a force which wounds you would wound me, too \u2013 but the range of psychic liability is very great indeed \u2013 a quite minor accident can throw one person into a serious decline \u2026 and leave another wholly unaffected.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, the majority of the court in <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) was, with respect, in error when it <i>equated</i> physical injury with psychiatric harm <i>for the purposes of formulating legal control mechanisms</i>. As we have just seen, given the <i>nature</i> of each type of injury, the respective <i>legal control mechanisms</i> ought to be <i>different</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It may, however, be argued that the legal control mechanism <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> psychiatric harm <i>is</i> different inasmuch as the majority of the court in <i>Page</i> had distinguished between primary victims on the one hand and secondary victims on the other. <i>However</i>, the question that then arises is this: <i>Why should such a distinction be drawn if both categories of victims have suffered the same type of injury,</i> viz<i>, psychiatric harm?</i> The answer, presumably, would be that a primary victim who suffers both physical injury and psychiatric harm ought to be subjected to fewer legal preconditions with regard to recovery because both types of injury ought to be treated as being the same. <i>However</i>, for the reasons we have given earlier (above at [70]\u2013[74]), this answer is, in fact, flawed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More important, perhaps, is the issue of <i>substantive justice</i> \u2013 or, as Lord\u00a0Goff put it in <i>White</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) at 475 (see the quotation set out above at [67]), \u201cpractical justice\u201d. Put simply, there is, in our view, no reason grounded in policy, principle or justice and fairness as to why a primary victim should be treated more favourably than a secondary victim; from this perspective, there is a powerful reason for doing away with the distinction between primary victims and secondary victims. Let us elaborate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The law, as originally formulated, has moved (in the context of damages for psychiatric harm) from allowing recovery by a primary victim only to extending recovery to a secondary victim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the English High Court decision of <i>Dulieu v White &amp; Sons</i> [1901] 2\u00a0KB 669 (\u201c<i>Dulieu</i>\u201d), the plaintiff was permitted to recover for nervous shock which was caused by her apprehension of physical injury as a result of the negligent conduct of the defendant. What engendered controversy was Kennedy\u00a0J\u2019s <i>dictum</i> in that case (at 675) to the effect that the shock concerned must arise from <i>reasonable fear of immediate personal injury</i> <i>to oneself</i>. This <i>dictum</i> was, in fact, <i>rejected</i> by the majority of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Hambrook</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>). In <i>Hambrook</i>, the plaintiff\u2019s wife had <i>not herself been in any personal danger</i>. However, she had just parted with her three children (a daughter and two sons), having (as was her habit) accompanied them part of the way to school. Shortly thereafter, she witnessed a lorry, which the defendants\u2019 servant had negligently left unattended, charging down the steep incline (where she was standing) and rapidly round the bend in the direction of where she had left her children. Although her children were not within her sight, the plaintiff\u2019s wife became very anxious for their safety. She inquired of bystanders what had happened and discovered that a little girl who wore spectacles had been taken away injured. This fit the description of her daughter. She became agitated, tearing her hair and screaming. She then rushed to the school and found her two sons there. However, her daughter was missing. She went to the hospital, where she found her daughter, who had been knocked down by the lorry and had suffered serious injuries. The plaintiff\u2019s wife was three or four months pregnant at that time. As a result of what happened, she suffered a serious nervous shock and, as a consequence, a severe haemorrhage as well. She recovered partially, but then suffered a relapse. She was operated on and a dead foetus was removed. Unfortunately, she died a few days later. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants under the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 (c\u00a093) (UK) in respect of the death of his wife to recover damages for the loss of her services as manageress of his restaurant. Although the defendants admitted the negligence alleged by the plaintiff, they argued that the shock alleged to have been sustained by the deceased wife was too remote. The majority of the court, however, held in favour of the plaintiff, although (unlike the situation in <i>Dulieu</i>) there had been no reasonable fear of personal injury to the plaintiff\u2019s wife herself. The majority\u2019s observations are particularly apposite and merit quotation in full.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, Bankes\u00a0LJ observed, in <i>Hambrook</i>, as follows (at 151):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Accepting the line of reasoning illustrated by these authorities [which included, <i>inter alia</i>, <i>Dulieu</i>], it follows that what a man ought to have anticipated is material when considering the extent of his duty. Upon the authorities as they stand, the defendant ought to have anticipated that if his lorry ran away down this narrow street, it might terrify some woman to such an extent, through fear of some immediate bodily injury to herself, that she would receive such a mental shock as would injure her health. <i>Can any real distinction be drawn from the point of view of what the defendant ought to have anticipated and what, therefore, his duty was, between that case and the case of a woman whose fear is for her child, and not for herself? Take a case in point as a test. Assume two mothers crossing this street at the same time when this lorry comes thundering down, each holding a small child by the hand. One mother is courageous and devoted to her child. She is terrified, but thinks only of the damage to the child, and not at all about herself. The other woman is timid and lacking in the motherly instinct. She also is terrified, but thinks only of the damage to herself and not at all about her child. The health of both mothers is seriously affected by the mental shock occasioned by the fright. Can any real distinction be drawn between the two cases? Will the law recognize a cause of action in the case of the less deserving mother, and none in the case of the more deserving one? Does the law say that the defendant ought reasonably to have anticipated the non-natural feeling of the timid mother, and not the natural feeling of the courageous mother? I think not.</i> In my opinion the step which the Court is asked to take, under the circumstances of the present case, necessarily follows from an acceptance of the decision in <i>Dulieu v. White &amp; Sons</i>, and I think that <i>the dictum of Kennedy\u00a0J</i>., laid down in quite general terms in that case, <i>cannot be accepted as good law applicable in every case</i>. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atkin\u00a0LJ observed, in the same case, thus (<i>id</i> at 157):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">I can find <i>no principle to support</i> the self-imposed restriction stated in the judgment of Kennedy\u00a0J. in <i>Dulieu v. White &amp; Sons</i>, <i>that the shock must be a shock which arises from a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to oneself.</i> It appears to me inconsistent with the decision in <i>Pugh v. London, Brighton and South Coast Ry. Co.</i> [[1896] 2\u00a0QB 498], and with the decision in <i>Wilkinson v. Downton</i> [[1897] 2\u00a0QB 57]<i>,</i> in neither of which cases was the shock the result of the apprehension of the injury to the plaintiff. <i>It would result in a state of the law in which a mother, shocked by fright for herself, would recover, while a mother shocked by her child being killed before her eyes, could not, and in which a mother traversing the highway with a child in her arms could recover if shocked by fright for herself, while if she could be cross-examined into an admission that the fright was really for her child, she could not. In my opinion such distinctions would be discreditable to any system of jurisprudence in which they formed part.</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Hambrook</i> is an important decision inasmuch as it <i>shifted</i> the English courts\u2019 approach <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> claims in negligence for psychiatric harm from what has commonly been described as the \u201cimpact theory\u201d to the \u201cshock theory\u201d (see, for example, Tan Keng Feng, \u201cNervous Shock to Primary Victims\u201d [1995] Sing\u00a0JLS\u00a0649 at 653). This shift is also justified by considerations of justice and fairness (as embodied in the observations of Bankes and Atkin\u00a0LJJ in <i>Hambrook</i>, which have just been quoted in the preceding two paragraphs; significantly, the latter judge was later to formulate the famous \u201cneighbour principle\u201d in the seminal House of Lords decision of <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> [1932] AC\u00a0562).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) has, in substance, effected is a <i>return</i> to the \u201cimpact theory\u201d in so far as <i>primary</i> victims are concerned (see \u201cNervous Shock to Primary Victims\u201d at 653). As aptly stated in Nicholas J\u00a0Mullany, \u201cPsychiatric damage in the House of Lords \u2013 Fourth time unlucky: <i>Page v Smith</i>\u201d (1995\u20131996) 3\u00a0Journal of Law and Medicine 112 (\u201cPsychiatric damage in the House of Lords\u201d) at 119\u2013120:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Insistence on foreseeability of mental injury through shock does not drive one to the conclusion that there is a separate tort of causing psychiatric damage. Clearly there is not. It is simply an insistence on the application of the tort of negligence to a particular type of personal injury rather than subsumption of damage to the mind within the broader category \u2026 Lord\u00a0Lloyd [in <i>Page</i>] saw insistence on reasonable foreseeability of mental injury by shock in direct participant cases as \u201ca step backwards\u201d \u2026 <i>The exact opposite is true. English common law has now backtracked in relation to such cases to a position not all that far removed from the \u201cimpact\u201d theory</i> ... [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Reference may also be made, in this regard, to Peter Handford, \u201cA New Chapter in the Foresight Saga: Psychiatric Damage in the House of Lords\u201d (1996) 4\u00a0Tort Law Rev 5 (\u201cA New Chapter in the Foresight Saga\u201d), where the learned author observed thus (at 7):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Whatever may have happened to the law of psychiatric damage in its earlier formative period, for the past fifty years this category of claim has been regarded as conceptually separate from ordinary cases of personal injury, marked off by the requirement that there must be reasonable foresight of psychiatric harm, assessed on an ex post facto basis, and limited by various other principles of proximity of relationship, time and space, and manner of infliction which do not apply to ordinary personal injury cases. \u2026 Lord\u00a0Oliver has [in <i>Alcock</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>)] made a valuable contribution to this branch of the law by distinguishing between primary and secondary victim cases, <i>but this is a distinction which merely goes to the issue of proximity and makes it easier to appreciate that psychiatric damage cases can arise in situations which do not involve an \u201caccident\u201d in the ordinary sense of the word</i>, for example cases in which such harm is occasioned by work conditions \u2026 <i>Under Lord\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s view [in</i> Page<i>], these developments are negated. Psychiatric damage as a category disappears except in cases involving secondary victims, thus putting the focus back on the traditional situation of witnessing accidents.</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The result of the majority\u2019s approach in <i>Page</i> is <i>to favour primary victims over secondary victims</i> although, as the observations of both Bankes and Atkin\u00a0LJJ in <i>Hambrook</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>) illustrate (see above at [80] and [81], respectively), there is no reason in logic, principle or (for that matter) justice and fairness to adopt such an approach. Indeed, one would have thought that, <i>at the very least, both primary as well as secondary victims ought to be treated in the same way. If so, then the test for determining the existence of a duty of care</i> vis-\u00e0-vis <i>both of these categories of victims in the context of claims for nervous shock should be the same</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are also <i>other difficulties</i> that arise from adopting the approach of the majority in <i>Page</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are, first, <i>practical difficulties</i> in <i>defining as well as identifying who a primary victim is</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The relevant case law itself demonstrates that there are both broader as well as narrower views of who a primary victim is (as embodied in the judgments of Lord\u00a0Oliver in <i>Alcock</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) at 407 and Lord\u00a0Lloyd in <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) at 184, respectively).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even more importantly, perhaps, it would, in our view, be invidious if the strictness of the applicable legal test as well as the possibility of completely contrary results ensuing were to depend on <i>how the relevant fact situation is characterised</i>. Put simply, a victim in the <i>same</i> fact situation could, <i>depending on how the relevant facts are perceived</i>, be <i>characterised</i> as either a primary victim or a secondary victim (and, on many occasions, with <i>equal persuasiveness</i>). In this regard, the following examples given by Prof\u00a0Trindade in a characteristically perceptive note on <i>Page</i> make the point both eloquently and pointedly, and are therefore quoted in full (see F\u00a0A\u00a0Trindade, \u201cNervous Shock and Negligent Conduct\u201d (1996) 112\u00a0LQR 22 at 24):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">It is implicit in the judgments of the majority in <i>Page v. Smith</i> that those who fall into the category of primary victims will be easy to identify; but is this likely to be the case? In <i>Page v. Smith</i> it was not difficult to conclude that the plaintiff was within the area of physical impact and that there was therefore a foreseeable risk of bodily injury to the plaintiff. But cases will not always be as simple as that. What of the passengers sitting on a bus with which a negligent motorist collides? Is it only the passengers who are in close proximity to the part of the bus where the impact occurs, or every passenger on the bus who could be said to be within the range of foreseeable physical injury? What of a passenger train which is derailed by the negligence of the engine driver? Is it only the passengers sitting in the derailed carriage or all the passengers on the train who are within the range of foreseeable physical injury? And what of the situation of a disabled aircraft which flies over a city and then crashes into a residential building \u2026 or a runaway lorry as in <i>Hambrook v. Stokes</i> [1925] 1\u00a0K.B. 141? Would there not be many people within the range of foreseeable injury? In the case of a runaway lorry would it matter that the plaintiff would have had ample time to step aside into a shop into a position of safety? Would that prevent the plaintiff [from] claiming to be a primary victim? And what of the example given by Lord\u00a0Ackner in <i>Alcock</i> \u2026 of a petrol tanker careering out of control into a school in session and bursting into flames? Who would be within the range of foreseeable physical injury? The children and teachers in the classrooms, those in the playground, parents or friends waiting to collect children, passers-by who fear that the petrol tanker might explode as a result of the collision?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">If all these persons can be said to be within the range of foreseeable physical injury then all of them could be said to be primary victims of the defendant\u2019s negligence. If this is so, then as a result of <i>Page v. Smith</i> all of them would be able to recover for any psychiatric illness that might be suffered by them, provided only that they can prove that the psychiatric illness was shock induced, genuine and caused by the accident. They would not be subject to any of the control mechanisms insisted on by the courts until now to keep in check liability for nervous shock. Even the passer-by unconnected with any child in the school could recover for nervous shock merely because he was within the range of foreseeable physical injury from the collision. The fact that nervous shock to him would not ordinarily be within the range of reasonable foreseeability would be irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a similar vein, Mrs\u00a0Hopkins has observed thus (see C\u00a0A\u00a0Hopkins, \u201cA New Twist to Nervous Shock\u201d <nobr>[1995] CLJ 491</nobr> at 493):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[I]s the distinction between primary and secondary victims, or between participants and non-participants, an entirely valid one? What of the \u201cnear miss\u201d? Would Mr.\u00a0Page [in <i>Page</i>] have succeeded if he had feared a collision because of the defendant\u2019s negligent driving but none had actually taken place? After a fifty-car motorway pile-up, is the driver of the fifty-first car who skilfully steers his vehicle safely onto the hard shoulder, witnessing scenes of carnage all around him and shaken in spite of his lucky escape, a primary or a secondary victim of the motorist who caused the initial crash? And, if all heads of illness can be lumped together as a type (which Lord\u00a0Lloyd regards [in <i>Page</i>] as \u201csensible\u201d because of the continuing expansion of medical knowledge), is there not a case for combining different types of property damage because of the continuing expansion of scientific knowledge? Is the phoenix of <i>Re Polemis</i> [1921] 3\u00a0K.B.\u00a0560 about to emerge from the ashes of <i>The Wagon Mound</i> [<i>ie</i>, <i>Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock Engineering Co Ltd</i> [1961] AC\u00a0188]? [The latter case overruled the former inasmuch as the latter laid down the general principle of remoteness of damage in tortious negligence based on reasonable foreseeability, whereas the former case had extended liability to everything that was the direct consequence of the defendant\u2019s initial negligent conduct.]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The practical (and related) result of the majority\u2019s approach in <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) is well-put by two leading commentators in the field, who observe that \u201c[t]he result is that counsel will still be looking to squeeze plaintiffs into the primary [victim] category wherever possible\u201d (see Nicholas J\u00a0Mullany &amp; Peter R\u00a0Handford, \u201cMoving the Boundary Stone by Statute \u2013 The Law Commission on Psychiatric Illness\u201d (1999) 22\u00a0UNSW Law Journal 350 (\u201cThe Law Commission on Psychiatric Illness\u201d) at 405). Indeed, they also point to actual inconsistencies which have been generated in the case law itself (<i>id</i> at 404\u2013405; see also United Kingdom, <i>Liability for Psychiatric Illness</i> (Law Com No\u00a0249, 1998) (\u201c<i>The English Law Commission Report</i>\u201d) at para\u00a06.12). The learned authors further point \u2013 correctly, in our view \u2013 to the fact that \u201c[t]he [English] Law Commission was quite clearly uncomfortable with the developments stemming from <i>Page v Smith</i>\u201d (see \u201cThe Law Commission on Psychiatric Illness\u201d at 403), but nevertheless did not resolve the difficulties and made inconsistent recommendations instead (see generally <i>id</i> at 403\u2013407; see also (for an overview of the difficulties engendered by <i>Page</i> and the English Law Commission\u2019s recommendations) <i>The English Law Commission</i> <i>Report</i> at paras\u00a02.52\u20132.60, 5.11\u20135.16 and 5.45\u20135.54).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following example by a local author illustrates both the difficulties referred to earlier (above at [77]\u2013[90]) in terms of distinguishing between primary and secondary victims, as well as the possible injustice that might result from the distinction itself (see Teo Cheng Seong, Daniel, \u201cThe New Orthodoxy in the Foresight Saga: A Look at <i>Page v Smith</i>\u201d (1997) 18\u00a0Sing\u00a0LR 300 at 309\u2013310):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">To illustrate the potential for injustice, consider the following example. A is slowly driving along a road in a long line of traffic and B is walking on the pavement alongside A\u2019s car. A crash barrier separates the road from the pavement so that a minor collision will not pose any foreseeable risk of physical injury to a passing pedestrian. Both A and B witness the car which is first in line negligently collide with a lorry, causing a pile-up which stops two cars short of A. Both consequently suffer nervous shock even though, owing to the relative mildness of the collision, nervous shock to either was not reasonably foreseeable. A may capitalize on the slight risk of physical injury to himself and recover for his psychiatric damage under <i>Page v Smith</i>, while B who is adequately protected from physical danger by the crash barrier fails in his action. To allow A\u2019s claim and deny recovery to B merely because some physical injury was foreseeable to the former seems as unfair as it is arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, this is not to state that there are no substantive legal consequences whatsoever arising from the fact that one plaintiff is, in effect, a primary victim and another, a secondary victim \u2013 even if this distinction is only recognised as a matter of <i>fact</i> (rather than, as <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) mandates, as a matter of <i>law</i>). As Mullany pertinently pointed out (see \u201cPsychiatric damage in the House of Lords\u201d ([83] <i>supra</i>) at 116):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The only significance of the difference between a person who witnesses or is informed of an event and a person directly involved in it is that <i>psychiatric impact to the direct participant is more likely to be foreseeable than [psychiatric impact] to the secondary victims</i>. This does not warrant the introduction of different duty tests and consequent unnecessary and undesirable complexity in liability assessment. The traditional foreseeability test is sound in principle \u2026 [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Reference may also be made to \u201cA New Chapter in the Foresight Saga\u201d ([83] <i>supra</i>). Indeed, as Lord\u00a0Keith pertinently pointed out in <i>Page</i> (at 167):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Where the plaintiff is personally involved in a terrifying incident proof of proximity presents no problem. Where, however, the plaintiff is what may be described as a secondary victim proximity may be very difficult to establish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">The following observations by Lord\u00a0Jauncey in the same case ought also to be noted (<i>id</i> at 176):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Lord\u00a0Oliver [in <i>Alcock</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>)] was considering proximity as determinative of the existence of a duty of care <i>and drawing a distinction between a victim directly involved in an accident and one who merely witnessed it.</i> He certainly was <i>not</i> saying that a victim directly involved in an accident did not require to prove the foreseeability of the nervous shock from which he suffered as a result thereof. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst it is true that Lord\u00a0Hoffmann pointed out, in the recent House of Lords decision of <i>Rothwell v Chemical &amp; Insulating Co Ltd</i> [2007] 3\u00a0WLR 876 (\u201c<i>Rothwell</i>\u201d), that <i>Page</i> \u201cdoes not appear to have caused any practical difficulties and is not \u2026 likely to do so if confined to the kind of situation which the majority in that case had in mind\u201d (at [32]), that observation itself cuts both ways, so to speak, inasmuch as given (as we pointed out above at [86]\u2013[90]) the difficulty of defining who a primary victim is as well as the possibility of substantive injustice being engendered by classifying a plaintiff in a particular way (<i>ie</i>, as either a primary victim or a secondary victim), the fact that <i>Page</i> is (according to Lord\u00a0Hoffmann in <i>Rothwell</i>) intended to apply in a very limited sphere only raises the question as to whether or not it is worth the effort to keep the legal principles laid down therein at all. Significantly, in <i>Rothwell</i> itself, the court was at pains to distinguish <i>Page</i> on the basis that the foreseeable event (<i>viz</i>, the development by the claimant of an asbestos-related disease due to exposure to asbestos in the course of his employment) had not occurred yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since an initial draft of this judgment was prepared, the House of Lords has handed down another decision where <i>Page</i>, whilst not directly applicable to the fact situation concerned, was referred to \u2013 see <i>Corr v IBC Vehicles Ltd</i> [2008] 2\u00a0WLR 499. Significantly, the criticism of <i>Page</i> was acknowledged by two law lords in that case (<i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Scott of Foscote at [29] and <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Walker of Gestingthorpe at [40]), although the decision in <i>Page</i> itself was not directly challenged in that particular appeal. Even more significantly, Lord\u00a0Neuberger of Abbotsbury (with whom Lord\u00a0Mance agreed (at [46])), referring, <i>inter alia</i>, to Lord\u00a0Goff\u2019s critique of <i>Page</i> in <i>White</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) (which is reproduced above at [67], and which we accepted (see above at [68])), clearly left the door open to a <i>reconsideration</i> of <i>Page</i> in the foreseeable future in the <i>English</i> context when he commented as follows (see <i>Corr v IBC Vehicles Ltd</i> at [54]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">The first point concerns the somewhat controversial decision of this House in <i>Page v Smith</i> [1996] AC\u00a0155. As Lord\u00a0Bingham [of Cornhill] has explained [in <i>Corr v IBC Vehicles Ltd</i> at [7]], neither party has criticised that decision, let alone invited the House to review it. At least for my part, I understood that was the position of the employer because, even if we had been persuaded that <i>Page v Smith</i> was wrongly decided, that would not have ensured the success of this appeal. I agree. Accordingly, not least in the light of the trenchant observations of Lord\u00a0Goff of Chieveley in <i>Frost v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police</i> [1999] 2\u00a0AC 455, 473D\u2013480F, I would not want to appear to prejudge any decision as to the correctness of the majority view in <i>Page v Smith</i>, if it comes to be challenged before your Lordships\u2019 House on another occasion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although English decisions on the common law (in particular, those emanating from the House of the Lords) are accorded great respect by our courts, they ought not to be followed blindly. Given the various difficulties pertaining to both justification as well as justice and fairness with regard to <i>Page</i> as set out earlier (above at [66]\u2013[91]), this is one occasion when we would respectfully hold that the law as laid down by the majority in <i>Page</i> ought not to be followed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>The position in Singapore</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>The position stated</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is now appropriate to draw the various threads of analysis together and state what the position is in the Singapore context in so far as liability in negligence for psychiatric harm is concerned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear that, as an extremely important threshold requirement, the plaintiff must prove that he or she has suffered what has often been termed a \u201crecognisable psychiatric illness\u201d (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Hinz v Berry</i> [1970] 2\u00a0QB 40 at 42 <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR). We should observe, parenthetically, that although it might be argued that this requirement should be considered, strictly speaking, under the rubric of \u201cdamage\u201d instead, from a practical perspective, it would be more appropriate that such a requirement (if it is considered by one (or more than one) party to constitute a live issue) is considered at the outset. Returning to the requirement proper, it is, in fact, a requirement that is more easily stated than ascertained (see, for example, generally, the discussion in <i>The English Law Commission</i> <i>Report</i> ([90] <i>supra</i>) at paras\u00a03.1\u20133.33). Psychiatric illness must be distinguished from sorrow and grief (no matter how severe), for the latter are considered as constituting part of the vicissitudes of life. It should also be noted that proof of a recognisable psychiatric illness will depend, in the main, upon the relevant expert psychiatric evidence tendered before the court, which, of course, retains the ultimate supervisory responsibility of ensuring that such expert evidence is defensible as well as grounded in logic and common sense (see, for example, the decision of this court in <i>JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong</i> <nobr>[2007] 4 SLR 460</nobr> at [49]\u2013[53] (citing the House of Lords decision of <i>Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority</i> [1998] AC\u00a0232)). Indeed, it seems to us that it may well not only save time and costs, but also aid the court immensely if <i>an independent psychiatrist</i> could be agreed upon by the parties or be appointed by the court in cases of this nature in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also endorse the approach taken in <i>Pang Koi Fa</i> ([24] <i>supra</i>) inasmuch as it adopts the approach in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) \u2013 in particular, we accept the three factors set out in the latter decision by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment therein (reproduced at [38] above), <i>albeit with important modifications</i> (see below at [109]). On a related note, we are further of the view that a \u201cpure\u201d test of reasonable foreseeability alone (as advocated by Lord\u00a0Bridge and Lord\u00a0Scarman in <i>McLoughlin</i> (see above at [35])) is too wide and, hence, ought not to be adopted in preference to that set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in the same case. However, we disagree, with respect, with the view that Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s characterisation of the three factors in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> is to be construed as a qualifying \u201c<i>policy</i>\u201d (in the sense of public policy) within the <i>second</i> stage of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>). As we explained earlier (above at [45]\u2013[52]), this is not what we think the learned law lord meant to say. If it is, we would, with respect, disagree with it as it would be both confusing and misleading. As explained (at [48] above), we are of the view that these factors relate, instead, to the concept of <i>proximity</i> within the <i>first</i> stage of the two-stage test laid down in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>) (reproduced above at [21]), which is itself modelled (albeit with modifications) on the test in <i>Anns</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before turning to consider the three factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> proper, it would be useful to recount briefly the nature and function of the concept of <i>proximity</i> as set out in <i>Spandeck</i>. In that case, Chan\u00a0CJ observed as follows (at [77]\u2013[82]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>first</i> stage of the test to be applied to determine the existence of a duty of care is that of proximity, <i>ie</i>, that there must be sufficient <i>legal</i> proximity between the claimant and [the] defendant for a duty of care to arise. The focus here is necessarily on the closeness of the relationship between the parties themselves, as alluded to by Bingham\u00a0LJ in the Court of Appeal stage of <i>Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman</i> [1989] QB\u00a0653, where he said (at 679) that while \u201c[t]he content of the requirement of proximity, whatever language is used, is not \u2026 capable of precise definition\u201d and \u201c[t]he approach will vary according to the particular facts of the case, \u2026 the focus of the inquiry is on the <i>closeness and directness of the relationship between the parties</i>\u201d [emphasis added]. Indeed, in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> [<i>&amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> [1964] AC\u00a0465] itself, the House of Lords used language which pointed to the relationship between the parties as being determinative of duty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although Lord\u00a0Keith in <i>Yuen Kun Yeu</i> [<i>v Attorney-General of Hong Kong</i> [1988] AC\u00a0175] referred (at 194) to the concept of \u201cclose and direct relations\u201d, he did not clarify what the concept mean[t]. However, in the Australian High Court decision of <i>Sutherland</i> [<i>ie</i>, <i>The Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman</i> (1984\u20131985) 157\u00a0CLR 424], Deane\u00a0J has observed thus (at 55\u201356):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">The requirement of proximity is directed to <i>the relationship between the parties</i> in so far as it is relevant to the allegedly negligent act or omission of the defendant and the loss or injury sustained by the plaintiff. It involves <i>the notion of nearness or closeness and embraces physical</i> proximity (in the sense of space and time) between the person or property of the plaintiff and the person or property of the defendant, <i>circumstantial</i> proximity such as an overriding relationship of employer and employee or of a professional man and his client and what may (<i>perhaps loosely</i>) be referred to as <i>causal</i> proximity in the sense of the closeness or directness of the causal connection or relationship between the particular act or course of conduct and the loss or injury sustained. It may reflect <i>an assumption by one party of a responsibility</i> to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the person or property of another or <i>reliance</i> by one party upon such care being taken by the other in circumstances where the other party knew or ought to have known of that reliance. <i>Both the identity and the relative importance of the factors which are determinative of an issue of proximity are likely to vary in different categories of case.</i> That does <i>not mean</i> that there is scope for decision by reference to idiosyncratic notions of justice or morality or that it is a proper approach to treat the requirement of proximity as <i>a question of fact to be resolved merely by reference to the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant in the particular circumstances.</i> The requirement of a relationship of proximity <i>serves as a touchstone and control of the categories of case in which the common law will adjudge that a duty of care is owed.</i> Given the general circumstances of a case in a new or developing area of the law of negligence, the question what (if any) combination or combinations of factors will satisfy the requirement of proximity is a <i>question of law to be resolved by the processes of legal reasoning, induction and deduction. On the other hand, the identification of the content of that requirement in such an area should not be either ostensibly or actually divorced from notions of what is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d \u2026 or from the considerations of public policy which underlie and enlighten the existence and content of the requirement.</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We respectfully agree with this analysis which merely unpacks \u201cproximity or neighbourhood\u201d as a composite idea, importing the whole concept of the necessary relationship between the claimant and the defendant described by Lord\u00a0Atkin in <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> [([82] <i>supra</i>)] (at 580). However, in this regard, we also acknowledge that there are numerous judicial pronouncements on the difficulty (and indeed, redundancy) in defining \u201cproximity\u201d. Some of these examples have already been cited above and it suffices only to reproduce Lord\u00a0Oliver of Aylmerton\u2019s speech in <i>Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police</i> [1992] 1\u00a0AC 310, where he said (at 411):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\">[I]n the end, it has to be accepted that the concept of \u201cproximity\u201d is an artificial one which depends more upon the court\u2019s perception of what is the reasonable area for the imposition of liability than upon any logical process of analogical deduction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding these judicial views, \u2026 these observations are \u2026 puzzling \u2026 If indeed the \u201cproximity\u201d concept is merely a label or an artificial exercise in judicial creativity, then one must ask why the concept is still resorted to or utilised in the various tests. Its very presence suggests that it has some substantive content that is capable of being expressed in terms of legal principles. Rather than denouncing it as a mere \u201clabel\u201d, the courts should strive to infuse some meaning into it, if only so that lawyers who advise litigants and even law teachers can make some sense of the judicial formulations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, Deane\u00a0J\u2019s analysis in <i>Sutherland</i>, that proximity includes physical, circumstantial as well as causal proximity, does provide substance to the concept since it includes the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance, where the facts support them, as essential factors in meeting the test of proximity. Where A voluntarily assumes responsibility for his acts or omissions towards B, and B relies on it, it is only fair and just that the law should hold A liable for negligence in causing economic loss or physical damage to B \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We only need to add, further, that in determining proximity as expounded by Deane\u00a0J in <i>Sutherland</i>, the court should apply these concepts first by analogising the facts of the case for decision with those of decided cases, if such exist, but should not be constrained from limiting liability in a deserving case only because it involves a novel fact situation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The above observations have been set out in full above not only because they represent the leading <i>general</i> analysis of the concept of <i>proximity</i> in the <i>Singapore</i> context, but also because (as will be shown below at [101]\u2013[103]) they are in fact <i>consistent with</i> the more <i>specific</i> factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> (reproduced above at [38]) in the context of liability for <i>nervous shock</i>, which factors are somewhat different when compared to, for example, the factors to be considered in a situation involving liability for pure economic loss (where the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance would more appropriately apply (although these criteria could also possibly apply in a situation of psychiatric harm, depending on the precise facts of the case at hand)). In particular, the three factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce are consistent with the broad categories set out by Deane\u00a0J in the Australian High Court decision of <i>The Council of the Shire of</i> <i>Sutherland v Heyman</i> (1984\u20131985) 157\u00a0CLR 424 (\u201c<i>Sutherland</i>\u201d) (see the quotation at [99] above), which were accepted by this court in <i>Spandeck</i> at [78]\u2013[79] (see, likewise, above at [99]) (see also the observations by Deane\u00a0J in the (also) Australian High Court decision of <i>Jaensch v Coffey</i> (1984) 155\u00a0CLR 549 (\u201c<i>Jaensch</i>\u201d) at 584\u2013585).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>first</i> factor set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), centring on <i>the class of persons</i> whose claims should be recognised, corresponds to the general category of <i>circumstantial</i> proximity referred to by Deane\u00a0J in <i>Sutherland</i> at 497.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>second</i> factor mentioned by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce, relating to <i>the proximity of the claimants to the accident</i>, corresponds to the general category of <i>physical</i> proximity referred to by Deane\u00a0J in <i>Sutherland</i> (<i>ibid</i>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>third</i> factor stated by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce, relating to <i>the means by which the shock is caused</i>, corresponds to the general category of <i>causal</i> proximity referred to by Deane\u00a0J in <i>Sutherland</i> (<i>ibid</i>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note, at this juncture, that <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>) has been the subject of very recent (and perceptive) critique by Prof\u00a0Kumaralingam Amirthalingam (see \u201cRefining the Duty of Care in Singapore\u201d (2008) 124\u00a0LQR 42 and \u201cLord\u00a0Atkin and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone: The Search for A Universal Test for Duty\u201d [2007] Sing\u00a0JLS\u00a0350 (\u201cLord\u00a0Atkin and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone\u201d)). Prof\u00a0Amirthalingam makes many salient points. Foremost amongst them is the argument that the concept of reasonable foreseeability should be restored as a <i>legal</i> test for determining the existence of a duty of care for, in his view, this concept \u201cserves an important normative function\u201d (see \u201cLord\u00a0Atkin and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone\u201d at 353). This would, in effect, reinstate the three-part test laid down by the House of Lords in <i>Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman</i> [1990] 2\u00a0AC 605 (\u201c<i>Caparo</i>\u201d), which comprises the following elements: (a)\u00a0foreseeability, (b)\u00a0proximity, and (c)\u00a0the requirement that the imposition of any duty of care be \u201cfair, just and reasonable\u201d (<i>id</i> at 618). With respect, we do not think that the law would be advanced by such a change. Indeed, the concept of <i>proximity</i> <i>itself</i> represents a <i>legal (or normative)</i> concept of <i>reasonable foreseeability</i>. The <i>alternative</i> concept of reasonable foreseeability which is advanced by Prof\u00a0Amirthalingam is, in substance and effect, a <i>factual</i> one which we view as being <i>an integral part of the (legal) test of proximity in the first place.</i> In other words, if the threshold issue of <i>factual</i> foreseeability is not even satisfied in the first instance (an occurrence which, we should think, would, in the nature of things, be rare, as we noted in <i>Spandeck</i> itself at [75]), <i>then the court cannot possibly proceed to ascertain</i> whether or not there is the requisite (legal) proximity between the parties simply because there is <i>no factual foundation</i> on which (legal) proximity can be founded. This is <i>not</i> to state that the establishment of a factual foundation will <i>necessarily</i> lead to a finding of (<i>legal</i>) <i>proximity</i>. The former is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the establishment of the latter. And, viewing the entire matter from a holistic as well as practical perspective, it is clear that there is no difference, <i>in substance</i>, between the approach adopted in <i>Spandeck</i> and that proposed by Prof\u00a0Amirthalingam.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should also be noted that although the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>), which forms the basis of the test laid down by this court in <i>Spandeck</i>, has not been followed in England, the law in that particular jurisdiction continues (as this court noted in <i>Spandeck</i> at [46]\u2212[49]) to remain in a state of flux (see, for example, the House of Lords decision of <i>Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc</i> [2007] 1\u00a0AC 181).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also interesting to note that the position in Canada is similar to that presently applicable in Singapore, where (as mentioned earlier at [98] above) a somewhat modified version of the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i> has been adopted. In particular, whilst affirming the two-stage test in <i>Anns</i>, the Canadian courts have considered both reasonable foreseeability and proximity under the first stage (see, for example, the Canadian Supreme Court decisions of <i>Cooper v Hobart</i> (2001) 206\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 193 at [30]\u2013[31]; <i>Odhavji Estate v Woodhouse</i> (2003) 233\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 193 at [46]\u2212[50]; <i>Hill v Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board</i> (2005) 259\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 676 at [47]; <i>Childs v Desormeaux</i> (2006) 266\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 257 at [9]\u2212[12]; and <i>Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v BD</i> (2007) 284\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 682 at [23]\u2212[30]). This approach is not necessarily at variance with that adopted in <i>Spandeck</i>, for (as we explained above at [104]) the concept of reasonable foreseeability is also an integral part of the process of ascertaining whether there is sufficient (legal) proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant, albeit on a preliminary (and factual) level.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position in Australia appears to be somewhat in a state of flux (see generally Francis Trindade, Peter Cane &amp; Mark Lunney, <i>The Law of Torts in Australia</i> (Oxford University Press, 4th\u00a0Ed, 2007) at ch\u00a09).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important, however, to emphasise that every application of the concept of proximity is heavily dependent on the precise factual matrix concerned. In other words, there is no mechanical formula that is to be applied by the court <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> these factors. In a similar vein, no one factor is more important than the other; nor is there any one unique way in which a particular factor is to be applied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to consider a separate \u2013 albeit no less important \u2013 point (or, in fact, major requirement) which arises from the very nature of <i>psychiatric harm</i> itself, namely, the potentially limitless reach of liability in negligence for this particular type of injury (see also [71] and [74] above). Given this factor, we are of the view that after applying the test for proximity, which incorporates the three factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), the <i>second</i> stage of the two-stage test laid down by this court in <i>Spandeck</i> should likewise be applied in the context of claims for psychiatric harm (<i>cf</i> also the reference by Deane\u00a0J to the concept of \u201csome other overriding limitation\u201d or \u201cother overriding control\u201d in <i>Jaensch</i> ([100] <i>supra</i>) at 592, and 600 as well as 603, respectively; see also the reference to the question of whether \u201cthe court considers it fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty\u201d <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Bridge in <i>Caparo</i> ([104] <i>supra</i>) at 618). <i>In other words, the test under Singapore law for determining the existence of a duty of care in the context of claims in negligence for psychiatric harm is the same two-stage test that was laid down by this court in</i> Spandeck <i>([2] supra). The first stage of this test encompasses the three factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in</i> Part\u00a03 <i>of his judgment in</i> McLoughlin <i>(as set out at [38] above), while the second stage comprises public policy considerations. Before the two-stage test applies, however, the presence of a recognisable psychiatric illness and factual foreseeability must, of course, first be established. This two-stage test is also (as emphasised in</i> Spandeck <i>at [73])</i> <i>(reproduced above at [21]) to be applied incrementally</i>. To this extent, therefore, the test which we have just laid down with regard to liability in negligence for psychiatric harm in the Singapore context is a <i>modified</i> version of the test enunciated by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> inasmuch as the learned law lord did <i>not</i> refer to those <i>policy considerations</i> which (as we have just mentioned) comprise the <i>second</i> stage of the two-stage test we have proposed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>However</i>, we would (for the reasons elaborated upon in detail above at [66]\u2013[91] and [95]) respectfully disagree with the distinction drawn in <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) between primary and secondary victims. The result is that in order for a plaintiff to establish a duty of care on the part of the defendant in the context of psychiatric harm, the plaintiff will have to establish factual foreseeability as well as proximity in the context of <i>psychiatric harm</i> in accordance with the criteria stated at [99]\u2013[103] above (which include the factors set out in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> as part of the first stage of the two-stage test).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>Possible reform of the three factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in</em> McLoughlin<em>?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Returning to the three factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) (which form part of the <i>first</i> stage of the two-stage test to be applied for determining liability in cases of psychiatric harm), we are cognisant of the fact that the English Law Commission has recommended that <i>only the first</i> factor (centring on the class of persons whose claims should be recognised) be retained (see item\u00a03 of the \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d of <i>The English Law Commission Report</i> ([90] <i>supra</i>)). In a similar vein, there have been suggestions by academic commentators to the effect that \u201c[p]erhaps one solution is a shift in emphasis to relational proximity [<i>viz</i>, the first factor], with resort to physical and perceptional proximity [<i>viz</i>, the second and third factors, respectively] only if the relationship is not a close one\u201d (see Lee Eng Beng, \u201cVindication of the Three Proximities\u201d [1992] Sing\u00a0JLS\u00a0528 at 539; see also F\u00a0A\u00a0Trindade, \u201cThe Principles Governing the Recovery of Damages for Negligently Caused Nervous Shock\u201d <nobr>[1986] CLJ 476</nobr> at 494\u2013495, which is cited in the former article). However, such a suggestion might well become (in substance and effect) a back-door means of introducing (whether intended or otherwise) reform to this area of the tort of negligence, which (as we point out below at [116]\u2013[120]) is a task not for the courts as such, but (rather) for the <i>Legislature</i>. Further, as Lee correctly admits (\u201cVindication of the Three Proximities\u201d at 540):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">However, once this position [of shifting the emphasis to relational proximity, with physical and perceptional proximity coming into play only if the requisite relational proximity is missing] is achieved, should not the law logically also include claims for psychiatric illnesses caused by having to care for an invalid husband, or by having to cope with having lost a child? <i>Again one faces the prospects of limitless liability. Ultimately, it has to be conceded that such a solution involves the mere substitution of one arbitrary line with another.</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It is significant that <i>The English Law Commission</i> <i>Report</i> recommended that the above change (or reform) in the law be effected via <i>legislation</i> (see, in this regard, the draft Negligence (Psychiatric Illness) Bill at Appendix\u00a0A of <i>The English Law Commission</i> <i>Report</i>). This signifies \u2013 by implication, if not expressly \u2013 that such a reform would <i>entail policy issues that are best decided by the Legislature</i>. We note that such a change in the law has in fact been effected in Australia via case law instead (see the Australian High Court decision of <i>Tame v New South Wales</i> (2002) 211\u00a0CLR 317 (\u201c<i>Tame</i>\u201d) (reference may also be made to the prescient observations of Deane\u00a0J in the earlier decision of the same court in <i>Jaensch</i> ([100] <i>supra</i> at 608\u2013609), as well as the perceptive comments on a leading South African decision (<i>viz</i>, <i>Barnard v Santam Bpk</i> 1999 (1)\u00a0SA\u00a0202): see Jonathan Burchell, \u201cAn Encouraging Prognosis for Claims for Damages for Negligently Inflicted Psychological Harm\u201d (1999) 116\u00a0S\u00a0African\u00a0LJ 697 (\u201cDamages for Negligently Inflicted Psychological Harm\u201d) and Nicholas J\u00a0Mullany, \u201cPersonal Perception of Trauma and Sudden Shock \u2013 South Africa Simplifies Matters\u201d (2000) 116\u00a0LQR 29 (\u201cPersonal Perception of Trauma and Sudden Shock\u201d)). However, it is also pertinent to note that well before <i>Tame</i> was decided, the Australian state of New South Wales had already promulgated <i>legislation</i> which allowed recovery by close relations (as defined therein) for \u201cmental or nervous shock\u201d under certain circumstances (see s\u00a04(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1944 (NSW) (\u201cthe 1944 NSW Act\u201d)).

In <i>Chester</i>, this Court held that no action for nervous shock could be brought by a mother who had suffered shock after seeing the dead body of her missing son in a trench under the control of the council. In <i>Bourhill</i>, the House of Lords denied a right of action to a woman who suffered nervous shock after hearing a motor cyclist collide with a motor vehicle. At the time she was unloading a basket from a platform on the other side of a nearby stationary tram. In the Second Reading Speech on the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the Legislative Council, the Minister for Justice said that s\u00a04 was \u201ca statutory extension of liability to meet the position created by the decision in <i>[Bourhill] v Young</i> ... It creates no new substantive right of action\u201d [citing New South Wales (Australia), Legislative Council, <i>Parliamentary Debates</i> (8\u00a0November 1944) at 830].</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">When s\u00a04 was enacted, it was seen as a beneficial provision that expanded the ability of close family members to recover for nervous shock. It was a legislative response to the perceived inadequacies in the common law, as then understood, to provide compensation to family members for nervous shock suffered as the result of injury to their relatives [citing <i>Jaensch</i> ([100] <i>supra</i>) at 601\u2013602 <i>per</i> Deane\u00a0J]. It removed the need for a family member to show the existence of a duty to the family member or that psychiatric injury to that person was reasonably foreseeable. The Minister said that the [B]ill would \u201cprovide a considerable advance on the present law\u201d [citing New South Wales (Australia), Legislative Council, <i>Parliamentary Debates</i> (5\u00a0December 1944) at 1491]. Nothing in s\u00a04 or its history supports Strang\u2019s [the defendant\u2019s] submission that the section was intended to operate to the exclusion of the common law and cover the field in relation to claims for nervous shock by family members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a04 of the 1944 NSW Act has since been repealed and the relevant statutory regime

of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1956 (NT)). In contrast, the Australian Capital Territory has replaced what used to be its statutory equivalent of s\u00a04 of the 1944 NSW Act (<i>ie</i>, s\u00a024 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1955 (ACT)) with legislation along the lines of Pt\u00a03 of the 2002 NSW Act (see the provisions in Pt\u00a03.2 of the Civil Law (Wrongs) Act 2002 (ACT)).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On a general level, it would appear that such statutory provisions (whether present or past) are in addition to, and not in derogation of, the common law (see <i>Gifford</i> ([112] <i>supra</i>) at [35]) (reproduced above at [112]).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Returning to the <i>Singapore</i> context, whilst we accept that there are cogent arguments for doing away with the second and third of the three factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) (reproduced above at [38]), we are of the view that such a step ought, if at all, to be effected via <i>legislative reform</i>. The danger of a floodgate of litigation ensuing in the event that these factors are dispensed with is a very real one. The English Law Commission itself acknowledged that this would be the case, and estimated that there would be somewhere in the region of a 10% increase in the number of personal injury claims; it also observed that higher insurance premiums (in the range of 2% to 5%) would result (see <i>The English Law Commission</i> <i>Report</i> ([90] <i>supra</i>) at paras\u00a01.12\u20131.13).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prof\u00a0Tan agreed with this assessment (see <i>Discussion Paper</i> ([74] <i>supra</i>) at p\u00a010), as follows (see also, by the same author, \u201cLiability for Psychiatric Illness\u201d ([39] <i>supra</i>) at 176\u2013177):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i>For every accident there will be two sets of plaintiffs: those physically injured (the immediate victims) and those close to the immediate victims in love and affection who suffer psychiatric illness as a result of this whether at or away from the accident (the related secondary victims). Psychiatric illness claims will automatically accompany the claims of those injured or killed if their loved ones can prove by expert psychiatric evidence that they actually suffered recognisable psychiatric illness as a result of the accident. Presently, with the existing common law restriction, such claims for psychiatric illness are exceptional. With the proposed legislative change [recommended by the English Law Commission] these psychiatric [illness] claims will become a regular additional feature in the relevant accident cases.</i> The [English Law] Commission guesstimates that extending the liability for psychiatric illness \u2026 will result in about a ten per cent increase in the number of personal injury claims and an increase of between two to five per cent in motor insurance premiums ([<i>The English Law Commission Report</i>], paras\u00a01.12 and 1.13). <i>The escalation of liability may be much more than what is estimated by the [English Law] Commission as the real increase in the number of such claims, after widespread public awareness of this liability and a greater claim consciousness of it, is difficult to quantify accurately at this stage.</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we noted earlier (above at [111]), the Australian High Court has (in <i>Tame</i> ([111] <i>supra</i>)) effected reform in this aspect of the tort of negligence through the <i>common law</i>. However, it is interesting to note that Prof\u00a0Trindade arrived at precisely the <i>same</i> conclusion, <i>viz</i>, that such reform (albeit made by way of case law as opposed to by way of legislation) would generate a similar danger of opening the floodgates to negligence litigation (see F\u00a0A\u00a0Trindade, \u201cReformulation of the Nervous Shock Rules\u201d (2003) 119\u00a0LQR 204 at 209\u2013210).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On a more <i>general</i> level, it is interesting that Prof\u00a0Tan was also of the view that legislative reform in the <i>Singapore</i> context was <i>not</i> necessary. In his view (see <i>Discussion Paper</i> at p\u00a011):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">Legislative reform of the law, at this stage of its development, when the medical and legal knowledge is not sufficiently mature, may interrupt the proper development of the law on an incremental case-by-case basis and may give rise to legislative recovery in certain areas of psychiatric illness that could, on implementation, prove to be more generous than envisaged. The latter could be a more serious problem for Singapore given that \u2026 accident victims are already preferred as a class and are in many ways better catered for compared to \u2026 others who suffer similar hardship from non-accident circumstances as a consequence of socio-economic insecurity or natural misfortunes. This is not to say that the common law liability for psychiatric illness, at this juncture, is satisfactory. Indeed, parts of the development are clearly controversial, but they are not so problematic or unsatisfactory as to require urgent legislative change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prof\u00a0Tan\u2019s <i>Discussion Paper</i> was accepted by the then Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law. Some years have passed since it was considered, but the general arguments still appear to hold good even today. What is important for present purposes, however, is that whether or not reform of this area of the tort of negligence is to be effected is one that is best left to the <i>Legislature</i>. Indeed, many of the imponderables referred to above lie wholly outside the expertise of the court and relate to policy matters which require the <i>Legislature\u2019s</i> consideration (see also above at [116]). One might add that another issue <i>not</i> hitherto considered in the present judgment that might require legislative attention is the common law requirement prescribing the need for sudden shock as one of the prerequisites to recovery (this requirement has already been departed from in the Australian context as a result of the Australian High Court\u2019s decision in <i>Tame</i> and, presumably, also in the South African context (see \u201cDamages for Negligently Inflicted Psychological Harm\u201d ([111] <i>supra</i>) and \u201cPersonal Perception of Trauma and Sudden Shock\u201d ([111] <i>supra</i>)); its abolition was also advocated by the English Law Commission (see <i>The English Law Commission Report</i> ([90] <i>supra</i>)).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>Summary of the applicable law relating to claims in negligence for psychiatric harm in Singapore</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">121<b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> It will be seen \u2013 primarily from our analysis of <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) as well as the position in the Singapore context above (see, especially, above at [57]) \u2013 that the present legal position on liability in negligence for psychiatric harm in the local context (assuming, of course, that there is the existence of a recognisable psychiatric illness to begin with) is <i>wholly consistent with</i> the two-stage approach adopted by this court in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>). This is especially the case once it is accepted (as we pointed out above at [100]\u2013[103]) that the three factors propounded by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> (reproduced above at [38]) fall within the <i>first</i> stage of this two-stage approach (and are, hence, an integral part of the inquiry as to whether there is sufficient (legal) <i>proximity</i> between the plaintiff and the defendant). We would reiterate that these three factors lend themselves to general application, regardless of whether the claimant was in the position of, say, Mr\u00a0Page (the plaintiff motorist) in <i>Page</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) or Mrs\u00a0McLoughlin (the plaintiff mother) in <i>McLoughlin</i>. Within this framework, the primary victim/secondary victim dichotomy established in <i>Page</i> is no longer relevant for the reasons set out earlier (above at [66]\u2013[91]).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>second</i> stage of the two-stage approach laid down in <i>Spandeck</i> involves considering whether, in the specific context and factual matrix of a given case, there are public policy factors that would entail the courts not imposing a duty of care even if there is otherwise sufficient proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant pursuant to the analysis carried out under the first stage. If, there are no applicable policy factors to negate the existence of a duty of care, then the courts will find a duty of care established on the part of the defendant, the breach of which would result in liability and the awarding of damages (subject, of course, to the established constraints on recovery of damages, including the doctrines of remoteness of damage, mitigation of damage as well as contributory negligence).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With this decision, therefore, this court has moved towards the ideal envisioned in <i>Spandeck</i> (at [71]) of having \u201ca <i>single</i> test \u2026 to determine the imposition of a duty of care in all claims arising out of negligence, <i>irrespective</i> of the <i>type</i> of the damages claimed\u201d [emphasis in original]. It is true that the three factors set out by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of his judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> relating to the ascertainment of whether there is sufficient proximity between the parties appear to differ somewhat from, for example, the factors highlighted in <i>Spandeck</i>, where the focus was on the twin criteria of the voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance (<i>id</i> at [81], reproduced above at [99]). However, this difference is more apparent than real. As we pointed out earlier (above at [100]\u2013[103]), the <i>general rationale underlying as well as the categories relating to the concept of proximity</i> are <i>common.</i> More importantly, we also pointed out (above at [108]) that in determining whether the requisite proximity is present in a particular case, much will turn on the precise factual matrix concerned. In the particular context of psychiatric illness or nervous shock, it is not surprising that Lord\u00a0Wilberforce framed the three factors in the way which he did. Even then, the <i>application</i> of these factors to the facts of the case concerned will, as just mentioned, be all-important. Looked at in this light, it would be very rare to find a case which could be said to constitute a precedent that is directly on point and, hence, conclusive. This is not, of course, to state that prior precedents (especially those that emanate from Singapore) are never helpful; on the contrary, many precedents may (and often do) assist in elucidating the applicable law and may even assist the courts in deciding on certain specific issues (where the comparative factual matrices, at least for those particular issues, are factually and/or legally the same).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><strong>Our decision with regard to the second appellant\u2019s case on appeal</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having covered the law applicable to the second appellant\u2019s claim against the respondent, we now turn to consider the merits of the second appellant\u2019s arguments before this court (on the assumption that she suffered a recognisable psychiatric illness). The second appellant essentially blamed the respondent\u2019s deceitful conduct for her plight. This conduct included, <i>inter alia</i>, the fact that the respondent had informed the second appellant that the physical condition of the first appellant was not serious when it was (in reality) quite the opposite, as well as the fact that the respondent had failed or neglected to tell the second appellant that the Taxi had collided into the rear of the Motorcycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>The second appellant\u2019s allegations against the respondent</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the allegation that the respondent had lied to the second appellant about the physical condition of the first appellant, the Judge made the following findings (see the GD at [62]\u2013[63]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the second plaintiff [<i>ie</i>, the second appellant] rightly conceded under cross-examination, if the second defendant [<i>ie</i>, the respondent] proved that he did not lie to her, her claim would and must fail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On her first allegation, the second plaintiff had conceded during cross-examination as well as on questioning by the court \u2026 that the second defendant [had] not lie[d] to her. It was the first plaintiff\u2019s [<i>ie</i>, the first appellant\u2019s] own evidence that he was wearing a helmet and a raincoat at the material time, that apart from his spinal injuries, he suffered no visible injuries other than bruises to his face and hands. Therefore, when the second defendant saw the first plaintiff lying on the road, the former could only see the latter\u2019s superficial injuries. Hence, the second defendant described to the second [plaintiff] what he actually saw. The second defendant would not know at that point of time, that the first plaintiff\u2019s other injuries were so serious as to render him a tetraplegic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was the second appellant\u2019s submission that the fact that the first appellant was immobile meant that the respondent should have known that something was seriously wrong with the first appellant, even if the respondent did not have prior knowledge of the injuries incurred. The Judge rejected this argument for the reasons set out at [63] of the GD (see the passage reproduced in the preceding paragraph). We agreed with the Judge and found no merit in this submission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also rejected the allegation that the respondent had failed or neglected to tell the second appellant that the Taxi had collided into the rear of the Motorcycle, as this was precisely one of the major issues that had to be decided by the court; in respect of this particular question, we had earlier found (for the reasons set out above at [14]\u2013[18]) that the Motorcycle had self-skidded and that there had therefore been no collision between the two vehicles, contrary to what the appellants alleged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What remained was the respondent\u2019s alleged failure to be more candid with the second appellant <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> his involvement in the Accident. In so far as this was concerned, the Judge observed as follows (see the GD at [85]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">I would stress that I do not for a moment condone the second defendant\u2019s actions subsequent to the [A]ccident. His conduct was reprehensible; he should have been more candid in his telephone conversations and subsequent personal contacts with the second plaintiff. He should have disclosed to her that the [T]axi was involved in the [A]ccident, even if it meant facing the wrath of the [plaintiffs\u2019] family, as the plaintiffs and their sons would undoubtedly blame him for the first plaintiff\u2019s plight. I believe the second defendant genuinely feared (however unfounded) that he would be charged by the Traffic Police over the accident. His anxiety to find out from the second plaintiff whether the first plaintiff had implicated him in anyway in my view far outweighed his expressed concern for the wellbeing of the first plaintiff.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge\u2019s remarks were, with respect, misdirected. At that point in time, given the circumstances of the Accident, it would not be surprising that the respondent, as a layperson, would have been fearful of being somehow implicated in the Accident. Given the circumstances, he could not be seriously faulted for trying to find out whether he had been implicated by the first appellant. He might have taken advantage of the emotional state of the second appellant for his own benefit, but the question which the court has to ask itself is: However morally reprehensible his conduct might have been, was the respondent guilty of conduct that was tortious in law?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only possible conduct in respect of which the respondent could arguably be said to owe a duty of care to the second appellant would be his communication of matters relating to the Accident to the second appellant. For the sake of completeness, and giving due consideration to the seriousness of the appellants\u2019 plight, we decided to consider whether such a duty did of care did indeed exist on the facts of this case, applying the test laid down in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>Foreseeability of damage</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated earlier (above at [21] and [104]), reasonable foreseeability \u2013 in the factual sense \u2013 of the damage or injury suffered is a preliminary threshold requirement which a plaintiff in a negligence action must satisfy. This requirement is almost always satisfied. As was stated in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 853</nobr> (at [55]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[T]he requirement of reasonable foreseeability from a <i>factual</i> perspective will <i>almost always be satisfied</i>, simply because of its very nature and the very wide nature of the \u201cnet\u201d it necessarily casts. There is therefore <i>no practical need</i> to include such a <i>factual</i> element within a <i>legal</i> formulation such as exists with regard to the existence (or otherwise) of <i>a duty of care</i>. \u2026 This is not to state that this last-mentioned (<i>factual</i>) element is to be discarded. As I have already mentioned, it will <i>almost always</i> be satisfied. [emphasis in original]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, even allowing for the naturally wide ambit of (factual) foreseeability, it was our view that this requirement was not satisfied in the present case in relation to the second appellant. To hold that it is reasonably foreseeable that the mere communication of the information in question without more could result in harm to a party boggles the imagination and stretches the realms of reality. We did (with great hesitation) acknowledge, however, that certain situations where information was communicated might, perhaps, result in the foreseeability of harm. But, this was not such a case. Nevertheless, on the assumption that the second appellant could establish the requisite factual foreseeability, we proceeded to consider the three factors set out in <i>Part\u00a03</i> of Lord\u00a0Wilberforce\u2019s judgment in <i>McLoughlin</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>) (see the passage reproduced at [38] above) in relation to the issue of (legal) proximity, which constitutes the first stage of the two-stage approach adopted in <i>Spandeck</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>Proximity</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>The class of persons whose claims should be recognised</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The presence of a spousal relationship between the first appellant and the second appellant was a factor in favour of finding that the respondent did owe the second appellant a duty of care on the facts of the present appeal. As Lord\u00a0Wilberforce stated in <i>McLoughlin</i> (at 422):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">As regards the class of persons [whose claims should be recognised], the possible range is between the closest of family ties \u2013 of parent and child, or husband and wife \u2013 and the ordinary bystander. Existing law recognises the claims of the first \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It is therefore clear, on the facts of the present appeal, that the requisite relational proximity existed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>Proximity to the tortious event</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In general, claims in negligence for damages for psychiatric harm usually arise in accident situations (<i>ie</i>, an accident is said to be the tortious event which caused the claimant to suffer psychiatric harm). In the present appeal, however, the alleged tortious event was the communication of information from the respondent to the second appellant, and not the Accident itself. If it were the latter, it was clear that the second appellant was not physically proximate to the alleged tortious event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-3\"><em>The means by which psychiatric harm is caused</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">135\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The traditional view in relation to causal proximity (<i>ie</i>, the means by which psychiatric harm is caused) was stated by Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>McLoughlin</i>, as follows (at 422\u2013423):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[T]here is no case in which the law has compensated shock brought about by communication by a third party \u2026 The shock must come through sight or hearing of the event or of its immediate aftermath.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">This traditional focus of the common law on direct physical perception is also reflected in the following statement of Windeyer\u00a0J in the Australian High Court decision of <i>Mount Isa Mines Limited v Pusey</i> (1970) 125\u00a0CLR 383 (at 407):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">If the sole cause of shock be what is told or read of some happening then I think it is correctly said that, unless there be an intention to cause a nervous shock, no action lies against either the bearer of bad tidings or the person who caused the event of which [he] tell[s]. There is no duty in law to break bad news gently or to do nothing which creates bad news.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With this as a starting point, we turn to consider cases where the courts have departed from the traditional view <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> situations where the communication of information led to psychiatric harm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">137\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The position of the second appellant was analogous to that of the plaintiff in cases such as the English High Court decisions of <i>Farrell v Avon Heath Authority</i> [2001] 1\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s\u00a0Rep\u00a0Med 458 (\u201c<i>Farrell</i>\u201d) and <i>Wilkinson v Downton</i> [1897] 2\u00a0QB 57 (\u201c<i>Wilkinson</i>\u201d), which she relied on. In <i>Farrell</i>, the plaintiff, who had fathered a son out of wedlock, was told to go to the hospital to see his newborn child. He was very excited at the prospect of fatherhood, but, upon arrival, was told that his son had died. He was asked whether he would like to see the dead baby. He replied in the affirmative and proceeded to kiss and cuddle the dead baby. A few minutes later, the nurses informed him that there had been a mistake and that his baby was alive. The plaintiff developed post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of this ordeal and sued for damages. Bursell\u00a0J held that the claimant could recover damages for the psychiatric harm suffered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">138\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Wilkinson</i>, the defendant falsely and maliciously represented to the plaintiff that her husband had been seriously injured. The plaintiff developed psychiatric harm and sued for damages for the injury to her health. Wright\u00a0J held that the plaintiff should succeed in her claim. In our view, <i>Wilkinson</i> is authority for the principle that wilfully communicating false information is actionable if it causes physical, including psychiatric, harm. In the present case, however, there was no intention to cause harm, much less the type of harm that the second appellant complained of.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">139\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the decision in <i>Farrell</i> is concerned, it extended \u2013 erroneously, in our view \u2013 the boundaries of recovery for psychiatric harm and therefore ought not to be followed. As Gummow and Kirby\u00a0JJ stated in the Australian High Court decision of <i>Tame</i> ([111] <i>supra</i> at 395):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">[I]n the absence of a malign intention, no action lies against the bearer of bad news for psychiatric harm caused by the manner in which the news is conveyed or, if the news be true, for psychiatric harm caused by the fact of its conveyance. The discharge of the responsibility to impart bad news fully and frankly would be inhibited by the imposition in those circumstances of a duty of care to avoid causing distress to the recipient of the news. There can be no legal duty to break bad news gently. This is so even if degrees of tact and diplomacy were capable of objective identification and assessment, which manifestly they are not. Neither carelessness nor insensitivity in presentation will found an action in negligence against the messenger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">140\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court should be slow to allow recovery for psychiatric harm arising from the communication of information in cases where no \u201cmalign intention\u201d (<i>Tame</i> at 395) on the part of the person communicating the information is present. This is clearly indicated by <i>Wilkinson</i> ([137] <i>supra</i>) (see above at [138]), as well as the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Janvier v Sweeney</i> [1919] 2\u00a0KB 316, which relates, in fact, to a special species of <i>intentional</i> torts, where the defendant wilfully does an act calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff (see also the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Malcomson Nicholas Hugh Bertram v Naresh Kumar Mehta</i> <nobr>[2001] 4 SLR 454</nobr> at [46]\u2212[48]). In those circumstances, that more harm than was anticipated resulted is immaterial. As we have already pointed out earlier (above at [138]), however, the present appeal did <i>not</i> involve an intentional tort in that the respondent had no intention to cause the second appellant harm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">141\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would also note that case law indicates that a possible remedy for psychiatric harm resulting from the communication of information could exist in situations where there is a professional relationship between the parties. For example, in the Supreme Court of South Australia decision of <i>Brown v The Mount Barker Soldiers\u2019 Hospital Incorporated</i> <nobr>[1934] SASR 128</nobr>, the defendant hospital negligently burnt a newborn baby out of sight of the mother, who suffered shock when told of her child\u2019s injury. The mother, who was a patient of the hospital at the material time, sued the hospital for the psychiatric illness suffered. Piper\u00a0J held that the hospital owed the mother a duty of care. In a similar vein, in <i>Furniss v Fitchett</i> <nobr>[1958] NZLR 396</nobr>, the Supreme Court of New Zealand allowed a plaintiff to succeed in an action against her doctor for nervous shock caused by his negligent disclosure to her husband of his opinion as to her mental stability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">142\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No such professional relationship existed between the second appellant and the respondent in the present appeal. More generally and importantly, it is clear, in our view, that the second appellant did not satisfy the requirement of legal proximity which constitutes the first stage of the two-stage approach adopted in <i>Spandeck</i> (which approach, as we held earlier, likewise applies to cases of psychiatric harm).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>Public policy</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">143\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to our conclusion (as just stated in the preceding paragraph) in relation to the issue of legal proximity on the facts of the present appeal, it was, strictly speaking, unnecessary for this court to proceed to consider the second stage of the two-stage test laid down in <i>Spandeck</i> ([2] <i>supra</i>), which centres on public policy. However, as we shall elaborate upon in a moment, a consideration of the latter serves to underscore the conclusion that was reached at the first stage of this two-stage test. More specifically, it will be seen that considerations of public policy militate against the finding of a duty of care where communication of information is concerned, even assuming that legal proximity can be established at the first stage of the two-stage approach adopted in <i>Spandeck</i>, except in situations where a \u201cmalign intention\u201d (<i>Tame</i> ([111] <i>supra</i>) at 395) on the part of the person communicating the information is present.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">144\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Uppermost in our minds were the potential ramifications to the commonplace activity of communicating news, and, in particular, the communication of bad news. In <i>Alcock</i> ([23] <i>supra</i>), Parker\u00a0LJ observed (when the case was before the English Court of Appeal) as follows (at 363):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\">It appears to me that if it can be reasonably foreseen that psychiatric illness can result from the shock of being told what has happened but the defendant is not liable, so also the defendant is not liable if the injury results from information conveyed by means of television and its commentary. If this is not correct it would, as it seems to me, follow that anyone who reports, at any rate promptly, the fact of death or serious injury would be liable for psychiatric illness resulting, as would the television company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">145\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It can be expected that a decision to allow recovery in all situations where communication of information results in psychiatric harm would result in a changed (and more constrained) approach towards the communication of bad news. As Gummow and Kirby\u00a0JJ opined in <i>Tame</i> at 395 (in a passage which was set out earlier at [139] above), recovery for psychiatric harm caused by the communication of information should be limited to situations where a \u201cmalign intention\u201d (<i>Tame</i> at 395) on the part of the person communicating the information is present in order to prevent the inhibition of full and frank disclosure of news.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-2\"><strong><em>Other observations</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">146\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order for a plaintiff to succeed in a claim founded on the tort of negligence, the following must be established:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the defendant breached that duty of care by acting (or omitting to act) below the standard of care required of it;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the defendant\u2019s breach caused the plaintiff damage;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the plaintiff\u2019s losses arising from the defendant\u2019s breach are not too remote; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 such losses can be adequately proved and quantified.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In so far as the issue of <i>liability</i> is concerned, the plaintiff is only required to establish that a duty of care was owed and that a breach of such duty occurred. The other requirements listed above are, strictly speaking, concerned with the assessment of damages and <i>not</i> with liability (see Harvey McGregor, <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th\u00a0Ed, 2003) at para\u00a01\u2013019, where the learned author emphasises the distinction between the <i>existence</i> of liability and the <i>extent and measurement</i> of liability <i>once it has been established</i>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">147\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the Judge purported to deal solely with the issue of liability, she expressly dealt with issues of remoteness and causation <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the second appellant, which issues, in the analysis of the learned author of <i>McGregor on Damages</i>, relate to the extent of liability (<i>viz</i>, the assessment of damages) and <i>not</i> the existence of liability. For the sake of completeness, however, we would express our agreement with the reasoning of the Judge with regard to both of these issues (as set out at [87] and [90] of the GD).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">148\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our consideration of the evidence and the parties\u2019 arguments demonstrated that the Judge was not plainly wrong in arriving at her decision that the respondent was not responsible for the first appellant\u2019s injuries. In so far as the second appellant was concerned, we found that there was no duty of care owed by the respondent to her. In the circumstances, we dismissed the appeal with costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">149\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That the Accident was a tragic one is undeniable, and we have the utmost sympathy for the very real plight of both the appellants. In this regard, we must commend Mr\u00a0Quentin Loh\u00a0SC, who was lead counsel for the respondent. At the conclusion of this appeal, he not only expressed his sympathy for the appellants, but also assured the court that, although he had no instructions as to costs, he would consult with his client and recommend that costs not be enforced against the appellants. He added that, if necessary, his own costs would be reduced.</p>\n\n<div><br clear=\"all\"/>\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn1\"

lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant in both appeals, Karaha Bodas Company LLC (\u201cKBC\u201d), is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The respondent in the first appeal, Civil Appeal No\u00a038 of 2005, is Pertamina Energy Trading Limited (\u201cPetral\u201d), a Hong Kong company that is a 99% subsidiary of the Indonesian state oil company, Perusahaan Pertambangam Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara (\u201cPertamina\u201d). The respondent in the second appeal, Civil Appeal No\u00a039 of 2005, is Pertamina Energy Services Pte Ltd (\u201cPES\u201d), a Singapore company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petral.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 22\u00a0December 2004, KBC filed Originating Summons No\u00a01646 of 2004 (\u201cthe OS\u201d) in the High Court in which Petral was named as the first defendant and PES was named as the second defendant. On the same day, KBC obtained a Mareva injunction against both respondents. Petral was prohibited from removing or disposing of any of its assets in Singapore up to the value of US$36,236,581.65 while PES was prohibited from disposing of or removing any of its assets (up to the same value) which it held, as nominee or otherwise, on trust for or on behalf of, or which were controlled by, Petral. A further order was made granting KBC leave to serve the injunction order and a sealed copy of the OS on Petral at its registered address in Hong Kong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each of the respondents subsequently filed an application to set aside the OS and its service on them and also to discharge the Mareva injunctions granted <i>ex parte</i>. These applications were heard together by Choo Han Teck\u00a0J. On 14\u00a0March 2005, he made the following orders in respect of each application:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that the OS as against the relevant respondent, its service on them and all subsequent proceedings be set aside;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that the Mareva injunction granted <i>ex parte</i> on 22\u00a0December 2004 against each respondent be discharged; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that there should be an inquiry as to the damages that each respondent had sustained, if any, by reason of the injunction order.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">KBC\u2019s appeals against those orders were heard by us on 24\u00a0August 2005 and dismissed. We now give the reasons for our decision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It was set up to participate in a geothermal resources project in Indonesia. In 1994, KBC made two contracts with Pertamina to produce and develop energy resources in Indonesia and to sell the energy produced. These contracts were subsequently terminated and KBC commenced arbitration proceedings against Pertamina for the damages sustained by reason of the termination. KBC obtained an arbitration award (\u201cthe Award\u201d) of about US$261m against Pertamina on 18\u00a0December 2000, and proceeded to enforce the Award in various jurisdictions, including the US, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC registered the Award in Hong Kong on 15\u00a0March 2002 and started enforcement proceedings there. It obtained and served a charging and garnishee order (\u201cthe Garnishee Order\u201d) against Petral on 24\u00a0May 2002. A receiver was also appointed by the High Court of Hong Kong (\u201c the Receiving Order\u201d) to find out what debts were due from Petral to Pertamina, and consequently to KBC, under the Garnishee Order and to receive moneys becoming due to Petral after 24\u00a0May 2002. In December 2004, KBC issued a judgment debtor summons against Petral in Hong Kong to find out the exact amount of the debts due from Petral to Pertamina. Petral\u2019s manager, Chan Ting Chung (\u201cGeorge Chan\u201d), was cross-examined before a master of the Hong Kong High Court. The master subsequently ordered that Petral pay KBC US$5.5m as he had ascertained from the evidence that three sums totalling this amount were due and accruing due from Petral to Pertamina as at the date of service of the Garnishee Order.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the same proceedings, George Chan was also cross-examined about money due from PES to Petral. His evidence gave the impression that about US$36m had been sent from Hong Kong to Singapore in order to evade execution of the Garnishee Order in Hong Kong. On this basis, KBC applied in Hong Kong for, and obtained on 21\u00a0December 2004, a worldwide Mareva injunction order against Petral to restrain it from dealing with its assets in and outside Hong Kong up to the sum of US$36,236,581.65. The day after obtaining this order, KBC filed the OS that started these proceedings in Singapore and obtained the orders against the respondents described in [2] above. It is pertinent to note that the reliefs claimed by KBC in the OS against the respondents read as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A declaration that the sum of US$36,236,581.65 or such other sum, being the total amount which was transferred from [Petral] to [PES] prior to 30\u00a0September 2004 is held by [PES], as a nominee or otherwise, on trust for or on behalf of or is controlled by [Petral].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An order that [PES] do forthwith repay the said sum of US$36,236,581.65 or such other sum, being the total amount which was transferred from [Petral] to [PES] prior to 30\u00a0September 2004 to [Petral] in Hong Kong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs of this application be paid by the [respondents] to [KBC].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The decision below</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The applications made by the respondents to set aside the OS, its service and all subsequent proceedings were stated to be made on the following grounds:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the OS disclosed no reasonable cause of action;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the OS was an abuse of the process of the court;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the OS sought to invoke an extravagant jurisdiction that was unwarranted in the circumstances of the case;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the purported claim was concocted for an improper and illegitimate purpose;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the court had no jurisdiction to grant the claim and remedy sought;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 leave for service of the OS on Petral in Hong Kong had been applied for improperly; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the joining of PES as a party to the action was improper, unnecessary and oppressive.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While Choo\u00a0J did not explicitly state the particular ground on which he had decided to set aside the OS, it appeared from his grounds of decision that he had relied on the lack of a cause of action to do so. During the course of the argument before him, KBC had met the respondents\u2019 assertions that there was no cause of action to found the OS by responding that even if this was so, which KBC did not accept, KBC would apply to convert the OS to a writ action and to amend its claim to include conspiracy as a cause of action. The judge did not accept that such an amendment would be possible. He stated at [18] of his grounds (reported at <nobr>[2005] 2 SLR 568</nobr>):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[KBC\u2019s counsel] submitted that [KBC\u2019s] claim would be amended to include conspiracy as a cause of action. I am of the view that the defect in the case is too serious to be cured by an amendment to the Originating Summons. An allegation of conspiracy requires the strictest pleading and a fully particularised statement of claim. Until all that is accomplished, there is no cause of action that will justify the present injunction from [<i>sic</i>] continuing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge indicated that he accepted the submissions of the respondents\u2019 counsel in respect of the injunction and the order for service out of jurisdiction. He agreed with the respondents\u2019 counsel that there was no jurisdiction in this case for the court to grant injunctive relief as KBC\u2019s real dispute was with Petral in Hong Kong and the relief that it was asking for in Singapore was ancillary in nature only. Citing <i>Siskina v Distos Compania Naviera SA</i> <nobr>[1979] AC 210</nobr> (\u201c<i>The</i> <i>Siskina</i>\u201d), <i>Mercedes Benz AG v Leiduck</i> <nobr>[1996] AC 284</nobr> (\u201c<i>Mercedes Benz</i>\u201d) and <i>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 560</nobr> (\u201c<i>Teo Siew Har</i>\u201d), the judge held that the Singapore court could not grant a Mareva injunction to assist proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction. Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, the court should not exercise its discretion to grant the Mareva injunction as KBC had not satisfied most of the requirements for such relief.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the order granting leave to serve the OS out of jurisdiction, the judge accepted the respondents\u2019 argument that KBC had not satisfied the requirement imposed by O\u00a011 r\u00a02 of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2004\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d) that a plaintiff asking for leave to effect service on a defendant who was out of the jurisdiction had to have a good cause of action against that defendant. KBC failed in this case because the main relief it had asked for had been a declaration that the sum of US$36,236,581.65 which had been transferred from Petral to PES prior to 30\u00a0September 2004 was held by PES, as a nominee or otherwise, on trust for or on behalf of, or was controlled by, Petral. The judge correctly observed that there was no cause of action which allowed the plaintiff to obtain a declaration stating that A owed B money when neither A nor B was the plaintiff. Moreover, KBC had not shown that any of the limbs of O\u00a011 r\u00a01 had been satisfied.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appeals</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC submitted that the following issues had to be determined in these appeals:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the learned judge erred in setting aside the OS on the ground that there was no cause of action;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if the OS did not disclose a cause of action, whether the learned judge erred in finding that the OS could not have been cured by an amendment;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the court had jurisdiction to grant the Mareva injunction;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the learned judge erred in deciding that KBC did not comply with the requirements for a Mareva injunction; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the learned judge was correct in setting aside the service of the OS on Petral.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">When we dismissed the appeals, it was because we broadly agreed with the judge\u2019s findings on issues (b) and (c) and considered that his decision to set aside the OS could be supported on other grounds. As a result of these conclusions, it was not necessary for us to deal with issues (d) and (e). We will take the arguments on the first three issues in turn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Whether the judge erred in setting aside the OS on the ground that there was no cause of action</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC\u2019s submissions on this issue were a little confusing. On the one hand, it said that the OS disclosed a reasonable cause of action. On the other hand, it contended that since the OS was, <i>inter alia</i>, for a declaration as to status, it did not require to be supported by a cause of action since the law is that a cause of action is not a precondition for a declaration. KBC then cited O\u00a015 r\u00a016 of the Rules which provides that no action or other proceeding \u201cshall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby\u201d and said that this \u201cwould constitute the basis/cause of action and/or [that] the claim for a declaration constitutes the cause of action\u201d. In support, KBC cited <i>Guaranty Trust Company of New York v Hannay &amp; Company</i> <nobr>[1915] 2 KB 536</nobr> (\u201c<i>Guaranty Trust Co</i>\u201d), <i>Newport Association Football Club Ltd v Football Association of Wales Ltd</i> [1995] 2\u00a0All ER 87, and <i>In re S (Hospital Patient: Court\u2019s Jurisdiction)</i> <nobr>[1995] Fam 26</nobr> (High Court) and <nobr>[1996] Fam 1</nobr> (Court of Appeal) (\u201c<i>Re\u00a0S</i>\u201d). In this respect, KBC\u2019s submission seemed to be that because O\u00a015 r\u00a016 gives a party the right to make a claim for a declaration without seeking substantive relief as well, making a claim for a declaration would by itself constitute a cause of action. We could not accept this formulation of the law even though we agreed with KBC that it did not need to have a cause of action against the respondents in order to claim declaratory relief. We also noted that KBC did not assert that it had a cause of action that was independent of O\u00a015 r\u00a016.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is a fundamental rule that in every case where a plaintiff claims relief against a defendant, his claim must be founded on a reasonable cause of action. Otherwise, the claim is liable to be struck out. The only exception to this rule is when the plaintiff does not ask for substantive relief against the defendant, in the form, for example, of an order for damages, but instead only asks for a declaration of right. That is the situation encompassed by O\u00a015 r\u00a016 which states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">No action or other proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This rule sets out the exception to the general principle. Order\u00a015 r\u00a016 does not in itself mean that a plaintiff who is asking the court to make a declaration of right must thereby be held to have a good cause of action. To hold so would be contrary to well-established law on what constitutes a cause of action. By 1978, it was clear that the controversy over whether a party applying for declaratory relief must also have a subsisting cause of action or a right to some other substantive relief as well was over, since it had been clearly established before then that he need not. See Lord\u00a0Diplock in <i>Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers</i> <nobr>[1978] AC 435</nobr> at 501 (\u201c<i>Gouriet</i>\u201d). In fact, as Lord\u00a0Diplock observed, relief in the form of a declaration of right would generally be superfluous for a plaintiff who had a subsisting cause of action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although we accepted KBC\u2019s position that it was not debarred from seeking declaratory relief even if it did not have a cause of action, that was not the end of the matter. A plaintiff who asks for declaratory relief must meet certain requirements. The question that arose was whether KBC satisfied all of those requirements. In its submissions, KBC accepted that the following are the requirements that must be satisfied before the court grants such relief:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the court must have the jurisdiction and power to award the remedy;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the matter must be justiciable in the court;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 as a declaration is a discretionary remedy, it must be justified by the circumstances of the case;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the plaintiff must have <i>locus standi</i> to bring the suit and there must be a real controversy for the court to resolve;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any person whose interests might be affected by the declaration should be before the court; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there must be some ambiguity or uncertainty about the issue in respect of which the declaration is asked for so that the court\u2019s determination would have the effect of laying such doubts to rest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">See: Jeffrey Pinsler, <i>Singapore Court Practice 2003</i> (LexisNexis, 2003), para\u00a015/16/4 citing <i>Salijah bte Ab Lateh v Mohd Irwan Abdullah</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 63</nobr> (High Court); <nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 201</nobr> (Court of Appeal) (\u201c<i>Salijah</i>\u201d).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In considering whether the above requirements had been satisfied in this case, we were chiefly concerned with the fourth requirement, that of <i>locus standi</i>. As far as an action for a declaration is concerned, the requirement that the plaintiff must have the <i>locus standi</i> required to bring the action is the equivalent of requiring a plaintiff in an action for substantive relief to have a cause of action. This is because in order to have the necessary standing, the plaintiff must be asserting the recognition of a \u201cright\u201d that is personal to him. Lord\u00a0Wilberforce in <i>Gouriet</i> ([13] <i>supra</i> at 483) was firm that declaratory relief cannot be granted unless:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">the plaintiff, in proper proceedings, in which there is a dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant concerning their legal respective rights or liabilities either asserts a legal right which is denied or threatened, or claims immunity from some claim of the defendant against him or claims that the defendant is infringing or threatens to infringe some public right so as to inflict special damage on the plaintiff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Lord\u00a0Diplock elaborated on the basis of this principle in the same case at 501 as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The only kinds of rights with which courts of justice are concerned are legal rights; and a court of civil jurisdiction is concerned with legal rights only when the aid of the court is invoked by one party claiming a right against another party, to protect or enforce the right or to provide a remedy against that other party for infringement of it, or is invoked by either party to settle a dispute between them as to the existence or nature of the right claimed. So for the court to have jurisdiction to declare any legal right it must be one which is claimed by one of the parties as enforceable against an adverse party to the litigation, either as a subsisting right or as one which may come into existence in the future conditionally on the happening of an event.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even in <i>Guaranty Trust Co</i> ([12] <i>supra</i>)<i>,</i> a case that KBC had cited as support for the proposition that a cause of action was not required in the context of declaratory orders because of the existence of O\u00a015 r\u00a016, it was made clear by the majority that though the right to claim a declaration was not confined to cases where the plaintiff had a cause of action, such a claim could only be made at the instance of a party who was interested in the subject matter of the declaration (<i>per</i> Pickford\u00a0LJ at 562) or if the claim related to a declaration of some right which the plaintiff maintained he had as against the person whom he had made a defendant to his suit (<i>per</i> Bankes\u00a0LJ at 571). The plaintiff in that case was seeking a declaration from the English Court that the defendant be restrained from suing him in the US. The plaintiff was thus asserting the recognition of a \u201cright\u201d personal to him even if he was not making a \u201cclaim\u201d against the defendant in England and, in that sense, had no cause of action in England. As was noted in <i>Re\u00a0S</i> by Hale\u00a0J ([12] <i>supra</i> at 34):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is argued on behalf of the plaintiff that declaratory relief can be sought by anyone with a sufficient interest even if that person\u2019s own legal rights or liabilities are not in issue. Reliance is placed on the well known words of Pickford\u00a0L.J. in [<i>Guaranty Trust Co</i>]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I think therefore that the effect of the rule [the predecessor to R.S.C., Ord. 15, r.\u00a016] is to give a general power to make a declaration whether there be a cause of action or not, and at the instance of any party who is interested in the subject matter of the declaration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">However, it is noteworthy in that case that it was the plaintiff\u2019s own legal position which was in issue. Moreover, Pickford\u00a0L.J. [in <i>Guaranty Trust Co</i>] went on to say:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It does not extend to enable any stranger to the transaction to go and ask the court to express its opinion in order to help him in other transactions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC\u2019s argument here was that but for its proceedings in Hong Kong, the sum of US$36m plus (\u201cthe US$36m\u201d) would not have been transferred to PES at all and Petral would not have reduced its trading activities with Pertamina. If there had been no such transfer, the natural result would have been that Petral would continue to owe debts to Pertamina which debts would either have been caught by the Garnishee Order (in respect of any debt accruing due as at 24\u00a0May 2002) or by the Receiving Order that appointed the receiver to collect debts accruing after 24\u00a0May 2002. Petral\u2019s deliberate reduction of its trading activities with Pertamina and the transfer of its money and business to PES defeated the purpose of the foregoing orders. As a result of Petral\u2019s conduct, Petral became less viable to KBC as an asset of Pertamina for execution purposes. KBC argued that in its capacity as the judgment creditor of Pertamina and the party in whose favour the Garnishee and Receiving Orders had been made, it clearly had the <i>locus standi</i> to raise, and a real interest in raising, the issues embodied in the OS, particularly in seeking the declaratory order and in having the moneys transferred by PES back to Petral in Hong Kong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The difficulty with the above argument was two-fold. First, the respondents contended that KBC\u2019s argument that if Petral had not transferred the US$36m to PES, it would not have reduced its trading activity with Pertamina and would therefore have owed more moneys to Pertamina that KBC could have garnished was a fanciful one, based on speculative wishful thinking. The possibility that Petral would have a greater indebtedness to Pertamina which would be subject to the Garnishee Order could not confer on KBC the <i>locus standi</i> required to seek a declaration for a payment order as between two other parties. To accept this argument would mean that any creditor in any jurisdiction, having any speculative claim founded on wishful assumptions of what might have been, would have the right to obtain a Mareva injunction and force moneys to be transferred to a jurisdiction of his choice. We agreed that KBC\u2019s claim was a speculative one in so far as it relied on the existence of debts between Pertamina and Petral. In our view, it did not follow that if Petral had not transferred the US$36m to PES, the whole of that sum would have been channelled towards trading activities with Pertamina. Even more so, it did not follow that Petral would eventually owe Pertamina the same amount and that the whole amount would be caught either by the Garnishee Order or the Receiving Order so that it would then be due to KBC. In our judgment, KBC had not established that it had a real interest in the US$36m.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, there was a more fundamental reason why KBC did not have the <i>locus standi</i> to initiate the OS against Petral and PES. In <i>Salijah</i> ([14] <i>supra</i>), this court held that in order to establish <i>locus standi</i>, a plaintiff must show that he had a \u201creal interest\u201d in bringing the action. Related to this was the idea that the court would only entertain a suit for a declaration if there was a \u201creal controversy\u201d between the parties to the action for the court to resolve. This court was there endorsing the principle recited in many editions of the English White Book (derived from Lord\u00a0Diplock\u2019s observation in <i>Gouriet</i> (see [15] <i>supra</i>)) that the jurisdiction of the court to make declarations of rights was confined to declaring contested legal rights of the parties represented in the litigation. The issue in this case, therefore, was whether KBC had the standing to seek a declaration regarding the rights of two other parties rather than a right it could claim for itself. The consistent position taken by the respondents was that KBC had no such standing because a plaintiff should not be able to commence proceedings seeking a declaration that A owed money to B, when the plaintiff was neither A nor B. This was the position that Choo\u00a0J adopted as well.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We agreed that the proceedings did not disclose that KBC had any right to make a claim to the US$36m in question. As the respondents submitted, the only two parties who had any claim to the said sum were Petral and PES. They had no dispute between them as to the status of the sum. As far as they were concerned, it was (contrary to the impression given under cross-examination in Hong Kong by George Chan) the bottom line net-off position of years of inter-company transactions during which payments were made <i>inter se</i> between Petral and PES and to third parties on behalf of each other. KBC had a money claim only against Pertamina for the US$261m and against Petral for US$5.5m. The OS did not relate to either claim. It concerned the US$36m reflected in the accounts of Petral as being due to Petral from PES. KBC had no money claim <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> Petral, much less PES, to the US$36m and, therefore, had no right in respect of which a claim for a declaration could be made. KBC\u2019s own legal position was not in issue in any way in the action commenced by the OS and, therefore, as Pickford\u00a0LJ said in <i>Guaranty Trust Co</i> (see [16] <i>supra</i>), the right given to it by O\u00a015 r\u00a016 to ask for a declaration would not extend to enabling it as a stranger to the transaction between Petral and PES to ask the court to express its opinion on the correct legal basis obliging PES to repay the sum to Petral simply in order to help KBC in its other transaction, to wit, the enforcement proceedings in Hong Kong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quite apart from the observations in <i>Guaranty Trust Co</i> and <i>Gouriet</i> that were inimical to KBC\u2019s case, there was also an authority, directly on point on the present issue, which had resulted in a decision adverse to the stand taken by KBC. In <i>Meadows Indemnity Co Ltd v Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc and International Commercial Bank plc</i> [1989] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 298 (\u201c<i>Meadows</i>\u201d), Meadows, who were reinsurers, sought to obtain a declaration against a bank, which was covered by a specific policy of insurance, declaring that the insurers were not bound to indemnify the bank in respect of any losses suffered by the bank. The English Court of Appeal unanimously came to the conclusion that Meadows as reinsurers had no standing to seek a declaration as against the bank. Neill\u00a0LJ, albeit somewhat reluctantly, held that he was bound by Lord\u00a0Diplock\u2019s holding in <i>Gouriet</i> to find that although Meadows had a direct interest in the validity of the bank\u2019s case against the insurers, there was no contested issue between Meadows and the bank and thus Meadows was not entitled to claim the declaration sought. This holding was approved by the High Court here in <i>British and Malayan Trustees Ltd v Sindo Realty Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 2 SLR 495</nobr> (\u201c<i>British &amp; Malayan Trustees</i>\u201d). These cases support the proposition that as there was no issue directly between KBC and the respondents on the status of the US$36m, KBC had no standing to seek a declaration as to the legal rights of Petral <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> PES in relation to the US$36m that had been transferred to the latter. It should also be noted that in <i>Meadows</i>, Neill\u00a0LJ recognised that the courts\u2019 jurisdiction to grant declarations did not encompass allowing them to declare the law generally or give advisory opinions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We must, before leaving this issue, deal briefly with <i>Re\u00a0S</i> ([12] <i>supra</i>)<i>,</i> a case that was much relied upon by KBC in support of its assertion that it did have a sufficient interest to obtain a declaration notwithstanding the lack of a contested legal right. In that case, S, a Norwegian citizen, had suffered a stroke in England and was being cared for in a private hospital there. His son arranged to transfer S to an hospital in Oslo. On learning of the proposed transfer, the plaintiff, an English woman and long-time companion of S, obtained an interim injunction preventing the transfer. Subsequently, she sought a declaration that it was not in S\u2019s best interests that he be removed from the jurisdiction. At first instance, the issue of whether the plaintiff had <i>locus standi</i> to seek this declaration was resolved by Hale\u00a0J in favour of the plaintiff on the basis that she had been able to show that her own legal position as prospective carer of S would be affected by the relief sought. Upholding this decision, the English Court of Appeal held that a dispute between rival claimants as to the care of an adult patient incapable of expressing his wishes in respect of treatment or care was a justiciable issue in respect of which the court\u2019s advisory declaratory jurisdiction could properly be invoked, and that where such application was brought by a claimant who could demonstrate a genuine and legitimate interest in obtaining a decision against an adverse party, the court would not impose nice tests to determine the claimant\u2019s precise legal standing. Sir\u00a0Thomas Bingham\u00a0MR, who elucidated the foregoing principle ([12] <i>supra</i> at 19), was at pains to state that it could not be suggested that any stranger or officious busybody, however remotely connected with the patient or with the subject matter of proceedings, could properly seek or obtain declaratory or any other relief. Millett\u00a0LJ, who agreed with the judgment of Bingham\u00a0MR, also considered (at 22) that Lord\u00a0Diplock\u2019s speech in <i>Gouriet</i> (see [15] <i>supra</i>) could no longer be taken to be an exhaustive description of the circumstances in which declaratory relief could be granted. Instead, in his judgment, the important thing was that there had to be:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">a real and present dispute between the parties as to the existence or extent of a legal right. Provided that the legal right in question is contested by the parties, however, and that each of them would be affected by the determination of the issue, I do not consider that the court should be astute to impose the further requirement that the legal right in question should be claimed by either of the parties to be a right which is vested in itself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">From the foregoing, it is apparent that a more flexible approach was adopted by the Court of Appeal in <i>Re\u00a0S</i> to the question of how a sufficient interest could be determined for the purpose of obtaining a declaration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC sought to persuade us to adopt the approach taken in <i>Re\u00a0S</i>. To do so would have given KBC persuasive grounds to argue that it had the standing to obtain the declaration that it asked for as KBC itself would be affected by the determination of the issue of whether PES was a trustee for Petral or only its debtor. If the moneys were trust moneys, PES could be ordered to transfer them back to Petral and there would then be a likelihood that KBC would be able to recover at least part of the transferred funds as a debt due from Petral to Pertamina.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also noted that the <i>Re S</i> approach had been recommended in Zamir &amp; Woolf, <i>The Declaratory Judgment</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd\u00a0Ed, 2002) over that taken by <i>Meadows</i> on the basis that the <i>Meadows</i> approach was inconsistent with the philosophy of the disposal of civil proceedings reflected in the English Civil Procedure Rules (c\u00a012) (\u201cCPR\u201d). The passage in question at p\u00a0241 states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <i>Meadows</i>, of requiring the declaration to relate to the claimant\u2019s private rights, imposes an unnecessary restriction on the use of declaratory relief \u2026 The greater flexibility shown by the Court of Appeal in <i>Re S</i> is to be welcomed and it is to be hoped that it will be adopted by the House of Lords if it comes to reconsider the position. The approach in <i>Meadows</i> is also inconsistent with the philosophy for the disposal of civil proceedings reflected in Part\u00a0I of the Civil Procedure Rules, and it may well be that the omission of any reference to \u201crights\u201d in CPR Part 40.20 will encourage the courts to take a broader view.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We were, however, not inclined to adopt the approach of <i>Re\u00a0S.</i> First, CPR Part\u00a040.20 is the rule reflecting the English court\u2019s power to grant declaratory reliefs. This is a new rule and it replaced the old rule that was <i>in</i> <i>pari materia</i> with our O\u00a015 r\u00a016 which, as it may be recalled, reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">No action or other proceedings shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations <i>of right</i> whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The new CPR Part\u00a040.20 differs from the above provision in that it does not state that a declaration has to be \u201cof right\u201d. In Singapore, the legislation concerning the power to grant declaratory reliefs still includes the requirement that the declaration be one of right. This restriction has been taken out of the English provisions and the English courts therefore, arguably, have more wide-ranging powers than we do. When Lord\u00a0Diplock made his famous pronouncement in <i>Gouriet</i>, the legislation in force was identical to our O\u00a015 r\u00a016. That same identical provision was in force (and the exact wording was set out in the judgment) when Neill\u00a0LJ held in <i>Meadows</i> that he was bound by Lord\u00a0Diplock\u2019s holding. As a matter of construction of the court\u2019s powers, therefore, as far as the Singapore courts are concerned, the approach of Lord\u00a0Diplock is as authoritative as it ever was. This approach was adopted by the local cases of <i>Salijah</i> ([14] <i>supra</i>) and <i>British &amp; Malayan Trustees</i> ([21] <i>supra</i>) where the court agreed that a declaration should only be granted when it concerned the rights of the parties represented in the litigation. We found no compelling reason to change that position.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further, <i>Meadows</i> was not cited in <i>Re\u00a0S</i>. There was, accordingly, no discussion as to why, when one coram of the Court of Appeal had considered itself bound by <i>Gouriet</i>, another coram should be at liberty to take a different position. On the other hand, the divergence in approach was, most likely, due to the fact that the considerations before that bench in <i>Re\u00a0S</i> were of a completely different nature from those before the court in <i>Meadows</i> and those faced by us here. <i>Re\u00a0S</i> was one of a long line of English cases relating to the treatment of patients who had either been rendered incapable of making decisions about their own welfare by reason of their illnesses or who did not have the mental capacity to make such decisions. As Bingham\u00a0MR noted, there had been many cases in which declaratory relief had (or would in principle have) been granted to help authorities, relatives or the next friend of the patient in somewhat similar circumstances to those in <i>Re\u00a0S</i> and, as a consequence, Zamir &amp; Woolf in the second edition of their book had commented that these cases constituted the development of a new advisory declaratory jurisdiction. Millett\u00a0LJ pointed out that the development of this jurisdiction to issue an \u201cadvisory declaration\u201d had been necessitated by the lacuna created when the courts in England were deprived of what was known as the \u201c<i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction\u201d. Thus, the circumstances that led to such a development were very far from those that faced us in the present case. We did not think that it was right to import and apply the modifications of principle developed to deal with those very differing circumstances to the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, whilst we agreed with KBC that the judge should not have set aside the OS on the ground that it disclosed no cause of action, in our judgment, the OS had in any case to be set aside because KBC had no <i>locus standi</i> to ask for the declaration it desired.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Whether the judge erred in finding that the OS could not have been cured by an amendment</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC submitted that even if the OS did not disclose a cause of action, the court should have followed its usual course of allowing an amendment instead of taking the drastic action of striking out the whole proceedings. It pointed out that courts are generally strict about exercising the power to strike out under O\u00a018 r\u00a019(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Rules and cited cases which held that the court would prefer to allow an amendment rather than take the drastic course of striking out. It argued that it should have been allowed to convert the OS into a writ and to amend its claim to include conspiracy as a cause of action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of our finding on the first issue, the cases cited by KBC on the approach taken under O\u00a018 r\u00a019 were not relevant. Those cases dealt with the amendment of a pleading to further particularise and elaborate the cause of action relied on by the plaintiff. In this case, since the plaintiff had no <i>locus standi</i> to ask for the declaration, what it was actually seeking to do by the amendment was to add an entirely new cause of action to its pleading. That course is covered by O\u00a020 of the Rules rather than by O\u00a018 r\u00a019. Order\u00a020 r\u00a05(5) allows the addition of a new cause of action to a writ or pleading if that new cause arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as the cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed. This provision is applied to an originating summons by O\u00a020 r\u00a07. In <i>Lim Yong Swan v Lim Jee Tee</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 500</nobr>, this court held that in determining whether O\u00a020 r\u00a05(5) had been satisfied, the test to be applied was whether there was a sufficient overlap between the facts supporting the existing claim and those supporting the new claim. The court also stated that the overlap of facts between the new cause of action and the original cause of action had to be apparent from the pleading of the applicant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our judgment, in this case, there was no sufficient overlap between the facts supporting the declaration initially sought by KBC and those supporting a cause of action based on conspiracy. In the affidavit sworn by Mr\u00a0Michael Joseph Pilkington, KBC\u2019s Hong Kong lawyer, and filed in support of the OS, the relevant facts listed were that Petral had taken steps to frustrate KBC\u2019s enforcement efforts in Hong Kong by transferring the US$36m to PES, and that that transfer was made with the intention that this money would be repaid to Petral upon the conclusion of the Hong Kong proceedings. As the judge noted, however, an allegation of conspiracy requires the strictest pleading and must be supported by full particulars. In our estimation, the facts listed by KBC in that affidavit were not sufficient to support a conspiracy claim. Indeed, in the draft Statement of Claim prepared by KBC, new facts were pleaded to support the assertion of conspiracy. These facts were that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 even though Petral was supposed to have ceased trading, PES was funding Petral\u2019s business such that Petral\u2019s business was in effect being carried on in Hong Kong with intent to defraud its creditors; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that PES and Petral had conspired together to defeat the US$5.5m order in [5] above.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Thus, even if KBC had applied to add a new cause of action to its existing proceeding pursuant to O\u00a020 r\u00a05(5), it would not have succeeded in this application.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Whether the court had jurisdiction to grant the Mareva</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">injunction</span></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choo\u00a0J held in relation to this issue that a Singapore court has no jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction to assist a plaintiff in his proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC made two arguments on appeal. First, it argued that it was not seeking \u201cfree-standing\u201d Mareva relief as its claim was for a declaration that the US$36m be held in trust and not for a Mareva injunction alone. Essentially, this was an argument that it had not asked for the Mareva injunction in order to assist its proceedings against Petral in Hong Kong but to support the declaratory relief sought in Singapore. We found no merit in this argument. KBC had no standing to ask for the declaration. Thus, the declaration did not constitute a valid substantive claim that KBC could rely on. In reality, therefore, KBC wanted the Mareva injunction in Singapore to support its Hong Kong proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KBC\u2019s second argument was that even if it were in substance only claiming a Mareva injunction in aid of foreign court proceedings, our courts have the jurisdiction to grant such an injunction. It submitted that the principle established by <i>The Siskina</i> ([9] <i>supra</i>), that a Mareva injunction could be granted only when the plaintiff had a substantive claim over which the court had jurisdiction, should not be followed. It drew our attention to various decisions emanating from various jurisdictions other than the UK in which the validity of that principle had come under attack and suggested that we should follow those decisions rather than continue to adopt the principle. As will be seen from the discussion below, the <i>The Siskina</i> principle that KBC wished us to override was only one of three principles established by that case. Before we could consider whether to adopt the approach suggested by KBC, we had to consider whether KBC was entitled to apply for a Mareva injunction against both PES and Petral under the first two principles formulated in <i>The Siskina.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The facts of <i>The Siskina</i> were as follows. The plaintiffs were the owners of cargo shipped on board the Panamanian-flagged vessel \u201cSiskina\u201d owned by the defendants, a Panamanian one-ship company. The vessel was on charter at the time the cargo was loaded and the plaintiffs paid freight to the charterer. The bills of lading issued conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the Genoese court. The charterer failed to pay charter hire to the defendants. The defendants therefore diverted the vessel and discharged the plaintiffs\u2019 cargo in Cyprus. They also exercised a lien over the cargo as security for the unpaid hire. The plaintiffs were then obliged to put up security in favour of the defendants to procure the release of the cargo. They also had to incur additional freight to ship the cargo from Cyprus to its ultimate destination. After discharging its cargo, the vessel sank. Thereafter, the defendants\u2019 only asset was the proceeds of their insurance policy and that was payable in London. The plaintiffs obtained a Mareva injunction in London over the insurance moneys pending settlement of proceedings in Cyprus where the defendants\u2019 claim for a lien over the cargo was being disputed. They also obtained leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction on the defendants pursuant to O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(i) of the English Rules of the Supreme Court (c\u00a054) (\u201cEnglish RSC\u201d). The defendants applied to set aside service of the writ and to discharge the injunction. They were successful on both counts. On appeal, the House of Lords held that there was no jurisdiction to commence substantive proceedings in England, that the writ and all subsequent proceedings in the action had to be set aside and, consequently, there could be no Mareva injunction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three legal principles arose out of the decision in <i>The Siskina</i>:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(i) of the English RSC did not allow the English court to assume jurisdiction against a foreign defendant on the merits of a claim just because the defendant had assets in England and the plaintiff had asked for a Mareva injunction against these assets. To give an example of this principle, if a German with an English bank account knocked down a Frenchman in Paris, the English court would not have jurisdiction to decide a claim by the Frenchman against the German for damages simply because the Frenchman included in his writ a claim for a Mareva injunction against the moneys in the German\u2019s English bank account.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was no jurisdiction to grant Mareva relief unless and until the plaintiff had an accrued right of action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was no jurisdiction to preserve assets within the jurisdiction of the court which would be needed to satisfy a claim against a defendant if it eventually succeeded regardless of where the merits of a substantive claim were to be decided. The statutory power to grant injunctions under s\u00a045 of the English Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925 (c\u00a049) did not empower the court to grant free-standing interlocutory relief brought in proceedings claiming only that type of relief.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">See Steven Gee, <i>Commercial Injunctions</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th\u00a0Ed, 2004) at para\u00a01.025.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When it came to this issue of jurisdiction, it appeared to us that there was a difference between the position of Petral, a foreign entity that would only be susceptible to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court if service on it could be effected pursuant to O\u00a011 of the Rules, and that of PES, a Singapore entity over which the court exercised its ordinary domestic or <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction. Taking Petral\u2019s position first, it was clear to us that Petral was covered by the first principle of <i>The Siskina</i> and that in relation to Petral, KBC\u2019s argument that the court had jurisdiction to grant free-standing Mareva relief was irrelevant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main discussion in the House of Lords focused on the English RSC O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(i), a provision that was <i>in pari materia</i> with O\u00a011 r\u00a01(<i>b</i>) of our Rules. It provided that service of a notice of writ out of England was permissible with the leave of court if in the action began by the writ, an injunction was sought ordering the defendant to do or refrain from doing anything within England. The House held that in order for a plaintiff to avail himself of this provision, the injunction sought in the action had to be part of the substantive relief to which the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action entitled him and could not be only an interlocutory injunction that was not founded on a substantive cause of action in respect of which relief was not sought in England. Lord\u00a0Diplock commenting on O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(i) of the English RSC stated ([9] <i>supra</i> at 256):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The words used in sub-rule\u00a0<i>(i)</i> are terms of legal art. The sub-rule speaks of \u201cthe action\u201d in which a particular kind of relief, \u201can injunction\u201d is sought. This pre-supposes the existence of a cause of action on which to found \u201cthe action.\u201d A right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is not a cause of action. It cannot stand on its own. It is <i>dependent upon there being a pre-existing cause of action</i> against the defendant <i>arising out of an invasion</i>, actual or threatened by him, <i>of a legal or equitable right of the plaintiff</i> for the enforcement of which the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court. <i>The right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is merely ancillary and incidental to the pre-existing cause of action.</i> It is granted to preserve the status quo pending the ascertainment by the court of the rights of the parties and the grant to the plaintiff of the relief to which his cause of action entitles him, which may or may not include a final injunction. \u2026 [T]he thing that it is sought to restrain the foreign defendant from doing in England must amount to the invasion of some legal or equitable right <i>belonging to the plaintiff in this country</i> and <i>enforceable here</i> by a final judgment for an injunction. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the respondents submitted, after <i>The Siskina</i>, it was settled English law that a plaintiff could never get a Mareva order which was essentially ancillary to proceedings that were pending in a foreign court where the defendant was not within the <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction of the English court. An English court would only grant a Mareva injunction in respect of a dispute which was being substantially litigated in England in which some legal or equitable right of the plaintiff was being invaded and which could be protected and enforced within England by a final judgment in England.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issue whether the court could assume jurisdiction over a foreign defendant simply because he had assets within the territorial jurisdiction that could be the subject of an injunction order came up again for consideration in 1995, this time before the Privy Council. In <i>Mercedes Benz</i> ([9] <i>supra</i>), a Privy Council decision on appeal from Hong Kong, the court affirmed the result in <i>The Siskina.</i> In our view, that case deserved close analysis as the factual situation was strikingly similar to that of the present case and the wording of the statutory provisions that the court had to construe, O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(b) and O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(m) of the Hong Kong Rules of the Supreme Court, was <i>in pari materia</i> with our own O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(<i>b</i>) and O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(<i>m</i>). The plaintiff in <i>Mercedes Benz</i> had instituted proceedings against the defendant, a German national, in Monaco and had then started another action against the defendant in Hong Kong and applied for a Mareva injunction over the defendant\u2019s assets there. Lord\u00a0Mustill, delivering judgment for the majority, decided the case on the point that the Hong Kong court had no territorial jurisdiction over the defendant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Mustill\u2019s judgment made clear that when a court was faced with a case that sought to combine both the extra-territorial jurisdiction under O\u00a011 and the Mareva injunction, the court was in fact faced with two questions. The first was whether it had territorial jurisdiction over the foreigner and the second was whether the court had the \u201cpower\u201d to make the order. His Lordship explained (at [9] <i>supra</i> at 297):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 the present case combines two jurisdictions, the extra-territorial jurisdiction under Order\u00a011 and the <i>Mareva</i> jurisdiction, both of which should be exercised with great circumspection \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is important at the outset to distinguish two questions. The first is concerned with territorial jurisdiction. The foreigner is outside the jurisdiction. The claim against him has no connection with the home territory. No action against him in respect of that claim is brought, or properly could be brought, before the local court. But he has assets within the territory. Assume for this purpose that <i>Mareva</i> proceedings could have been commenced by writ or other originating process, and assume also that such relief could properly be given: i.e., that notwithstanding <i>The Siskina</i> [1979] A.C.\u00a0210 <i>Mareva</i> relief in support of foreign proceedings is permissible. Does the statutory enlargement of its territorial jurisdiction created by Ord. 11, r.\u00a01(1) entitle the court to permit the service of a writ or other originating process claiming such relief on the foreigner out of the jurisdiction, thus compelling him to choose between suffering a judgment in default or appearing before a court which has no other jurisdiction over him to argue that his assets should not be detained?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The second question is concerned with a different kind of jurisdiction; or more accurately, a power. Assume for this purpose that the foreign defendant is someone who can be brought before the English court to answer a claim for a <i>Mareva</i> injunction, either because he is present here or because (contrary to the first defendant\u2019s contentions on the first issue) Ord. 11, r.1(1)(<i>b</i>) is wide enough to cover all kinds of injunction. Assume also that the matters in dispute have no connection with the English court, and that the plaintiff neither can, nor as in the present case intends to, bring them before that court. Does the court have power to restrain the free disposition of the defendant\u2019s assets in England and Wales, to await the conclusion of proceedings brought against that person in a foreign jurisdiction?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Applying the above discussion to the present case, it was apparent that the first question concerned only Petral as the foreign defendant whilst the second question (a question referable to the third consequence of <i>The Siskina</i>) concerned only PES which was not a foreign defendant and could be brought before the Singapore court to answer a claim for a Mareva injunction because it was present here.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having set out the two questions, Lord Mustill then indicated that in relation to a foreign defendant, of the two questions, the court should consider the question of territorial jurisdiction first for if the court had no territorial jurisdiction, the second question did not arise. In coming to its decision on this question, the majority of the Privy Council bore in mind that the court had no powers to make orders against persons outside its territorial jurisdiction unless authorised by statute as there was no inherent extra-territorial jurisdiction. Further, it was important to the resolution of the issue that the Mareva injunction was quite a different kind of injunction from any other as it was really a kind of attachment. Thus, in the court\u2019s view, it was not enough simply to say that since a Mareva injunction was an injunction, it automatically fell within O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(b). The question that had to be asked was whether an extra-territorial jurisdiction grounded only on the presence of assets within the jurisdiction was one which sub-para\u00a0(b) was intended to assert. The majority of the court answered this question in the negative. This was because, as Lord\u00a0Mustill explained at 301 and 302:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he purpose of Ord. 11, r.\u00a01 is to authorise the service on a person who would not otherwise be compellable to appear before the English court of a document requiring him to submit to the adjudication by the court of a claim advanced in an action or matter commenced by that document. Such a claim will be for relief founded on a right asserted by the plaintiff in the action or matter, and enforced through the medium of a judgment given by the court in that action or matter. The document at the same time defines the relief claimed, institutes the proceedings in which it is claimed, and when properly served compels the defendant to enter upon the proceedings or suffer judgment and execution in default. Absent a claim based on a legal right which the defendant can be called upon to answer, of a kind falling within Ord. 11, r.\u00a01(1), the court has no right to authorise the service of the document on the foreigner, or to invest it with any power to compel him to take part in proceedings against his will.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Thus, at the centre of the powers conferred by Order\u00a011 is a proposed action or matter which will decide upon and give effect to rights. An application for <i>Mareva</i> relief is not of this character.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the above passage, the Privy Council was pointing out that neither an application for a Mareva injunction nor the existence of the injunction itself has any connection with, or influence on, the issues to be decided in the substantive action. Whilst a Mareva injunction does give a plaintiff a certain measure of protection, that protection does not enforce any rights that the plaintiff has to obtain substantive relief, but only helps to ensure that when the plaintiff does succeed in obtaining a judgment against the defendant in the jurisdiction, there will be something for the judgment to bite on. As an ancillary matter that does not impinge on substantive rights, the Mareva injunction cannot justify the extension of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, generally territorial in nature, to a person who would otherwise be outside it. For completeness, we add that the Privy Council also found that O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(m), which permitted service out of the jurisdiction when the claim was brought to enforce any judgment or arbitral award, was not applicable to the situation before them because there was no judgment against the defendant that was already in an executable form. This was also the situation before us since KBC did not have a judgment in Singapore against Petral in an executable form.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was a minority opinion in <i>Mercedes Benz</i>, that of Lord\u00a0Nicholls of Birkenhead. He held that O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(b) would apply to a claim for a Mareva injunction when it comprised the sole relief sought. His opinion was that there was nothing exorbitant about this jurisdiction provided the anticipated judgment was one which would be recognised and enforceable in the forum. We could not accept that decision. We found Lord\u00a0Mustill\u2019s interpretation of O\u00a011 r\u00a01(1)(b) to be persuasive. We agreed that the language of O\u00a011 indicated that it was confined to originating documents which set in motion proceedings designed to ascertain substantive rights. This was borne out by the reference in O\u00a011 r\u00a01 of our Rules to an injunction being sought in \u201cthe action\u201d and the fact that O\u00a011 r\u00a02(1)(<i>b</i>) requires a plaintiff to state that he believes he had a \u201cgood cause of action\u201d. To us, as it did to Lord\u00a0Diplock, that language implied that there must be a pre-existing cause of action to which the injunction was merely ancillary.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of Petral, we were satisfied that the principle established by <i>The Siskina</i> and reiterated by <i>Mercedes Benz</i> regarding the lack of <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over a foreign defendant where no substantive claim was made against him was a sound one and that it should be adopted by us. This court had considered <i>The Siskina</i> in a previous decision, to wit, <i>Teo Siew Har</i> ([9] <i>supra</i>), and accepted it as good law but that was on another point. In the result, we found that the Singapore court had no <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over Petral, a Hong Kong entity with no presence here, simply because it had assets in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moving to PES, in our view, the respondents could not rely on the first consequence of</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Siskina</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">in order to refute KBC\u2019s claim for</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mareva relief since PES was not a foreign entity but a Singapore incorporated company and thus subject to the ordinary jurisdiction of the Singapore court. The respondents\u2019 second argument, however, that it was not possible to obtain a Mareva order in respect of a potential or possible substantive action even though the same, when it arose, would be a cause of action arising within the jurisdiction, was applicable to PES\u2019s situation. In this connection, it was established by <i>The Siskina</i> and followed by many other cases including <i>Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Ltd v Thakur Shipping Co Ltd</i> [1986] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s\u00a0 Rep 439 (\u201c<i>Thakur Shipping</i>\u201d) that in order to apply for Mareva relief, the plaintiff must possess an accrued right of action against the defendant at the time of the application. In this case, at the time the OS was filed, KBC had no accrued right of action against PES in Singapore or even in Hong Kong for that matter. It had no money claim against PES nor did it have the standing to ask for a declaration that PES was holding money in trust for Petral. It had no judgment against Petral that it had registered in Singapore so as to entitle it to garnish moneys that PES might have owed Petral. The US$5.5m order in Hong Kong, which was the only order for payment of money that KBC had against Petral, had not been registered in Singapore and indeed was not registerable as it was not a final order. It may be that one day, KBC will get a final judgment in some jurisdiction against Petral and may register the same in Singapore and such judgment may then come to be dealt with substantively by the Singapore court. Until then, seeking a Mareva injunction against PES to protect its position would be, as Sir\u00a0John Donaldson\u00a0MR put it in <i>Thakur Shipping</i> (at 440), obtaining \u201csecurity for a future cause of action \u2013 a cause of action which will give rise to entitlement to monetary relief\u201d and, in our view, that is something that the law does not permit, as to obtain Mareva relief requires one to have an existing legal or equitable right, as <i>The Siskina</i> itself made plain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our decision on the application of the first two principles arising from</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Siskina</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">was sufficient to dispose of the third issue arising in the appeals. There was a sub-issue relating to jurisdiction to which KBC addressed a substantial portion of its argument on appeal but which could not be dealt with in this judgment. It would be recalled that the third principle established by</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Siskina</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">was that the court had no jurisdiction to preserve assets within England in order to support the plaintiff in a claim he was making in a foreign jurisdiction. There has been considerable debate on the extent to which this principle is still in force. That sub-issue did not, however, arise for decision in this appeal. This was because in relation to Petral, there was no personal jurisdiction over it, and in relation to PES, even if there had been an accrued right of action against it, there was no claim being pursued against PES in a foreign jurisdiction. Accordingly, any views that we would express on this issue in this judgment would be <i>obiter</i> and would lack context. Thus, they would not give sufficient guidance to the Bar on the extent to which the principle applies in Singapore.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

They are the proprietor of European patent No 0239425, which covers, inter alia, the HIV-2, a retrovirus capable of causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (`AIDS`) in man. The patent relates to a discovery made by Professor Luc Montagnier and his team at the premises of the first respondents in 1986. The European patent application was filed on 22 January 1987 and granted on 2 November 1989, and claims priority from its French application, which was filed on 22 January 1986 (`the priority date`).<br/><br/>One of the countries designated in the European Patents Office (`EPO`) filing was the United Kingdom. The patent was subsequently re-registered in Singapore under the Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act on 15 January 1993 under No 9190285-8.<br/><br/>The claims of the patent cover the following aspects:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Claims 1 to 9</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">-</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">the HIV-2 and variants thereof;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Claims 10 to 19</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">-</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">the antigens of HIV-2;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Claims 20 to 32</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">-</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">the compositions for the in vitro detections of HIV-2 antibodies;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Claims 33 to 37</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">-</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">the processes for the in vitro detection of, inter alia, HIV-2 antibodies;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Claims 38 to 40</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">-</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">diagnostic kits for the in vitro detection of inter alia, HIV-2 antibodies.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The second respondents are a company incorporated in France. The first and second respondents entered into a collaboration agreement on 26 March 1981, which was renewed on 11 July 1990 (`collaboration agreement`). Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, the second respondents are the exclusive licensee of the first respondents` patent.<br/><br/>The appellants are a local subsidiary of an American biopharmaceutical company, Genelabs Technology Inc. They make and sell, inter alia, diagnostic kits that utilise a laboratory technique known as Western Blot to detect HIV-2. Their kits are known as `Genelabs Diagnostics HIV-2 Western Blot 1.2` (`Blot 1.2`) and `Genelabs Diagnostics HIV-2 Western Blot 2.2` (`Blot 2.2`).<br/><br/>The Western Blot is a variation of a procedure devised in the 1970s to detect deoxyribonucleic acid (`DNA`) fragments, known as Southern Blot. When the technique was adapted to detect ribonucleic acid (`RNA`) fragments, it was called Northern Blot. When the technique was subsequently adapted to detect proteins, it was termed Western Blot.<br/><br/>In a Western Blot analysis, HIV proteins are separated by a standard laboratory technique known as gel electrophoresis. This technique makes use of an electric current to separate the proteins. The smaller proteins would move through the gel faster than the larger proteins, thereby allowing for separation according to size. The separated proteins, such as gp41 and gp120, are then transferred to a strip of special nitrocellulose paper paper by blotting the paper to the gel. Each nitrocellulose strip would thus contained several discrete proteins of HIV.<br/><br/>The testing process operates on the principle of antigen-antibody reaction. In very basic terms, antibodies are formed and released by the body in response to the introduction of antigens into the body. An antigen is a substance foreign to the body that stimulates the production of antibodies. The antibody is a protein created to neutralise the harmful effects of the antigen. It is highly specific for the antigen that elicited its production and will interact only with that antigen.<br/><br/>During testing, serum from a patient is applied directly to the antigenic protein bands located on the nitrocellulose strips. If antibodies are present in the serum, they will bind to their complementary antigenic determinant, forming an immunological conjugate, also called immunological complex. Thus, a HIV gp120 antibody would bind to the HIV gp120 antigenic determinant. A colouring agent is used to detect if an antibody has complexed with any of the banded HIV antigenic proteins located on the nitrocellulose strip. The presence of such colour reaction would indicate that the patient has HIV.<br/><br/>Evidence was led that in about 1996, the respondents became aware that HIV-2 test kits were manufactured and sold by the appellants. In April 1998, the respondents carried out investigations that culminated in trap purchases of the appellants` Blot 1.2 and Blot 2.2 diagnostic kits in July 1998. After testing the diagnostic kits for possible infringement of the patent, the respondents decided to commence action against the appellants, asserting that Blot 1.2 infringed claims 12, 13, 20, 22, 24, 33, 34, 35, 38 and 39 of the patent and that Blot 2.2 infringed claims 19, 20, 33, 34, 35, 38 and 39 of the patent.<br/><br/>In defence, the appellants contended that the patent was not valid. They centred their defence on the lack of novelty and inventive steps in claims 19 and 33. These claims cover:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Claim 19</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Antigens having the following amino acid sequence or a part of said sequence, providing that it raises a specific immunological reaction with the antibodies against a HIV-2 retrovirus, according to any one of claims 1 to 9, especially when this antigen is contacted with the serum of a patient infected with HIV-2 ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Claim 33</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Process for the in vitro detection of the presence of antibodies, induced in man infected with a human HIV-2 retrovirus, in a human biological sample such as a serum and more particularly for the in vitro diagnosis of a potential or existing LAS or AIDS due to such a retrovirus and obtained from the person being diagnosed, characterised in that this biological sample is contacted with an antigen recognised by an antibody induced in the infected man, by a human HIV-2 retrovirus as defined in claims 1 to 9 in conditions authorising the formation of an immunological complex between this antigen and the said antibody and in that the possibly immunological conjugate formed between this antibody and antigen used is detected.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellants also argued that there was insufficient disclosure in the patent and that the defence of acquiescence applied by virtue of the respondents` unreasonable delay in pursuing relief.<br/><br/><strong><i> Decision below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The trial judge held that the patent is valid. He found that there was novelty in claim 19 of the patent, as the prior art documents, either individually or collectively, did not clearly and unmistakeably disclose any antigen having the amino sequence or part thereof described in claim 19. It was not logical to suggest that the prior art revealed the function of detecting a virus which was then unknown. Claim 33 is concerned with the process to detect the new virus. It would follow that the process is new when it provides the means to detect a new virus.<br/><br/>The trial judge found that the inventive step requirement was satisfied in respect of claim 19 as it was not obvious to invent an antigen with the specified sequence to detect an as yet unknown virus. The inventiveness manifested in claim 33 was in the recognition that a new virus was responsible for causing AIDS in West Africa and providing the means to detect it by using an antigen.<br/><br/>The trial judge also found that the appellants` diagnostic kits infringed the claims of the patent as the sequence of 18 amino acids (`18mer`) used by the appellants in their diagnostic kits was a highly immuno-reactive portion of the amino acid sequence set out in claim 19, and while the diagnostic kits also used five other amino acids, the latter did not alter the immuno-reactive character of the 18mer but served only as a fixing and stabilising agent for the 18mer on the nitrocellulose strip.<br/><br/><strong><i> Issues </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before us the appellants canvassed the same issues which were raised in the court below, namely:   </p>\n    <p>(i) were the inventions, as disclosed in claim 19 and 33 of the patent, novel; </p>\n    <p>(ii) did the inventions, as disclosed in claim 19 and 33 of the patent, involve any inventive steps; </p>\n    <p>(iii) was there sufficient disclosure in claims 19 and 33; </p>\n    <p>(iv) did the production/sale of the diagnostic kits by the appellants infringe the patent; </p>\n    <p>(v) was there any delay/acquiescence on the part of the respondents in commencing proceedings against the appellants; </p>\n    <p>(vi) as the collaboration agreement between the respondents was not registered at the commencement of the action, is the second respondent precluded from recovering damages or seeking an account of profits in view of s 75 of the Patents Act 1994 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act` or `the 1994 Act` as may be appropriate in the context).<br/><br/>From the appellants` case, it is quite clear that the first two issues are their main contentions. Nevertheless, we will consider each of the issues in turn.<br/><br/><strong><i> Novelty </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Under s 13(1) of the Act an invention, to be patentable, must satisfy the following conditions:   </p>\n    <p>(i) the invention is new; </p>\n    <p>(ii) it involves an inventive step; and </p>\n    <p>(iii) it is capable of industrial application.<br/><br/>In relation to the present case, it is not in dispute that condition (iii) is satisfied. It is in relation to the first and second conditions that the present case turns.<br/><br/>Section 14(1) of the Act provides that an invention shall be taken to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art. Subsection (2) elaborates on the concept of the `state of the art` as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The state of the art in the case of an invention shall be taken to comprise all matter (whether a product, a process, information about either, or anything else) which has at any time before the priority date of that invention been made available to the public (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) by written or oral description, by use or in any other way.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In relation to this case, the priority date is 22 January 1986, that being the date on which the subject patent was applied for in France.<br/><br/>The first requirement raises the question of novelty and the contention of the appellants is that the invention had been anticipated by prior disclosure in four prior art publications. A leading authority which dealt with the question of prior disclosure is  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre &amp; Rubber Co Ltd &amp; Ors</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1972]  RPC 457</font> and there the Court of Appeal stated (at p 485):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... the question whether the patentee`s claim is new for the purposes of s 32(1)(e) falls to be decided as a question of fact. <strong> If the prior inventor`s publication contains a clear description of, or clear instructions to do or make, something that would infringe the patentee`s claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee`s patent, the patentee`s claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty, that is to say, it will have been anticipated</strong>. The prior inventor, however, and the patentee may have approached the same device from different starting points and may for this reason, or it may be for other reasons, have so described their devices that it cannot be immediately discerned from a reading of the language which they have respectively used that they have discovered in truth the same device; but if carrying out the directions contained in the prior inventor`s publication will inevitably result in something being made or done which, if the patentee`s patent were valid, would constitute an infringement of the patentee`s claim, this circumstance demonstrates that the patentee`s claim has in fact been anticipated.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>If, on the other hand, the prior publication contains a direction which is capable of being carried out in a manner which would infringe the patentee`s claim, but would be at least as likely to be carried out in a way which would not do so, the patentee`s claim will not have been anticipated, although it may fail on the ground of obviousness. <strong> To anticipate the patentee`s claim the prior publication must contain clear and unmistakeable directions to do what the patentee claims to have invented: Flour Oxidizing Co Ltd v Carr &amp; Co Ltd</strong> ((1908) 25 RPC 428 at 457, line 34, approved in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>BTH Co Ltd v Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1928] 45 RPC 1</font> at 24, line 1). <strong> A signpost, however clear, upon the road to the patentee`s invention will not suffice. The prior inventor must be clearly shown to have planted his flag at the precise destination before the patentee</strong>. [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the recent case,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc v HN Norton &amp; Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1996]  RPC 76</font>, the plaintiffs discovered an anti-histamine drug called terfenadine for use by people who suffered from hay-fever and similar allergies. Unlike other similar drugs, this drug did not have the side effect of making the person drowsy. The plaintiffs` exclusive right to terfenadine expired in December 1992. Other drug manufacturers thus embarked on making and marketing terfenadine. However, the plaintiffs claimed that their monopoly in terfenadine continued because of a later patent. This later patent came about because their research showed that terfenadine was absorbed in the small intestines and was then 99.5% metabolised in the liver. This was why it had no side effects. They analysed the chemical composition of the acid metabolite formed in the liver. No one had identified that compound before. So they patented the acid metabolite. The plaintiffs` claim to a later patent was in respect of acid metabolite as a product. The defendants contended that while the acid metabolite as a chemical compound had not been previously identified, its manufacture in the body by the ingestion of terfenadine was nevertheless part of the state of the art. This submission was upheld by the House, which essentially approved the approach taken in <strong><i> General Tire </i></strong>. Lord Hoffmann, who delivered the only judgment of the House, explained the point by way of an analogy (at p 88):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>There is an infinite variety of descriptions under which the same thing may be known. Things may be described according to what they look like, how they are made, what they do and in many other ways. Under what description must it be known in order to justify the statement that one knows that it exists? This depends entirely upon the purpose for which the question is being asked. Let me elaborate upon an example which was mentioned in argument. The Amazonian Indians have been known for centuries that cinchona bark can be used to treat malarial and other fevers. They used it in the form of powdered bark. In 1820, French scientists discovered that the active ingredient, an alkaloid called quinine, could be extracted and used more effectively in the form of sulphate of quinine. In 1944, the structure of the alkaloid molecule (C20H24N2O2) was discovered. This meant that the substance could be synthesised.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Imagine a scientist telling an Amazonian Indian about the discoveries of 1820 and 1944. He says: `We have found that the reason why the bark is good for fevers is that it contains an alkaloid with a rather complicated chemical structure which reacts with the red corpuscles in the bloodstream. It is called quinine.` The Indian replies: `That is very interesting. In my tribe, we call it the magic spirit of the bark.` Does the Indian know about quinine? My Lords, under the description of a quality of the bark which makes it useful for treating fevers, he obviously does. I do not think it matters that he chooses to label it in animistic rather than chemical terms. He knows that the bark has  a quality which makes it good for fever and that is one description of quinine.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I recognise that there is a distinction between cinchona bark and terfenadine. The former is a substance occurring in nature and the latter is an artificial product. This might have been relevant if the medicinal qualities of the bark had been unknown and a person who discovered them had tried to patent the bark or the natural alkaloid. But the distinction is not material to the present question, which is essentially an epistemological one: what does it mean to know something, so that it can be part of the state of the art? The quinine example shows that there are descriptions under which something may in a relevant sense be known without anyone being aware of its chemical composition or even that it has an identifiable molecular structure. This proposition is unaffected by whether the substance is natural or artificial.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>His Lordship then concluded (at pp 90-91):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In this case, knowledge of the acid metabolite was in my view made available to the public by the terfenadine specification under the description `a part of the chemical reaction in the human body produced by the ingestion of terfenadine and having an anti-histamine effect`. Was this description sufficient to make the product part of the state of the art? For many purposes, obviously not. It would not enable anyone to work the invention in the form of isolating or synthesising the acid metabolite. But for the purpose of working the invention by making the acid metabolite in the body by ingesting terfenadine, I think it plainly was. It enabled the public to work the invention by making the acid metabolite in their livers. The fact that they would not have been able to describe the chemical reaction in these terms does (not) mean that they were not working the invention. Whether or not a person is working a product invention is an objective fact independent of what he knows or thinks about what he is doing. ... The Amazonian Indian who treats himself with powdered bark for fever is using quinine, even if he thinks that the reason why the treatment is effective is that the tree is favoured by the Gods. The teachings of his traditional medicine contain enough information to enable him to do exactly what a scientist in the forest would have done if he wanted to treat a fever but had no supplies of quinine sulphate.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Anticipation by disclosure, on the other hand, relies upon the communication to the public of information which enables it to do an act having the inevitable consequence of making the acid metabolite. The terfenadine specification teaches that the ingestion of terfenadine will produce a chemical reaction in the body and for the purpose of working the invention in this form, this is a sufficient description of the making of the acid metabolite. Under the description, the acid metabolite was part of the state of the art.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>A pertinent EPO case relied upon by the House of Lords in <strong><i> Merrell Dow </i></strong> was  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Availability to the Public Decision G01/92</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1993]  EPOR 241</font> where the Enlarged Board of Appeal held that the composition or internal structure of a product becomes part of the state of the art if it is possible for a skilled person to discover it and reproduce it without undue burden.<br/><br/>In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Merck &amp; Co Inc v Pharmaforte Singapore Pte Ltd</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:2000:3:717:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:2000:3:717:\">  [2000] 3 SLR 717 </a>, this court, having considered the authorities, concluded that for a prior publication to anticipate the patent it must be established that following the teachings in the prior publication would inevitably lead to the invention covered by the patent. The prior disclosure must not only identify the subject matter of the claim in the later patent, it must do so in a way that enables the skilled man to make or obtain it, a kind of enabling disclosure.<br/><br/>Finally, we would refer to an early case,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hills v Evans</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1862] 31 LJ Ch 457</font> at 463, where Lord Westbury LC set out the test to apply to determine whether the disclosure, contained in a prior document, is such as to invalidate a subsequent invention, in these terms:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The antecedent statement must, in order to invalidate the subsequent patent, be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive and understand and be able practically to apply the discovery without the necessity of making further experiments ... the information ... given by the prior publication must, for the purposes of practical utility, be equal to that given by the subsequent patent.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In this regard, there is a preliminary point which arises for consideration: it is whether the four prior art publications (hereinafter referred to as `the four publications` or individually as `Kanki 1`, `Daniel`, `Kanki 2` and `Barin`) should be read individually or collectively. A nineteenth century case,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Von Heyden v Neustadt</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1880] 50 LJ Ch 126</font>, decided that as a general rule prior art documents should not be read collectively but individually, to determine what information each contained. In that case, the defendants put in evidence a mass of materials, extracted from a large number of publications, to show anticipation. James LJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said (at p 128):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We are of opinion, that if it requires this mosaic of extracts from annals and treatises, spread over a series of years, to prove the defendants` contention, that contention stands thereby self-condemned.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>And if it could even be shown that a patentee had made his discovery of a consecutive process by studying, collating and applying a number of facts discriminated in the pages of such works, his diligent study of such works would as much entitle him to the character of an inventor as the diligent study of the works of nature would do.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>An exception to this rule would appear to be the case where a later document referred to an earlier document or where a series of papers, which formed a series of disclosures, do refer to each other:  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Sharpe &amp; Dohme Inc v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1927] 44 RPC 367</font>.<br/><br/>Of course, difficult situations can arise where a later document only refers to an aspect of a prior document. Would one therefore be justified to read the entire earlier document with the later document as if they were one or does one confine such reading to only that part or those parts of the earlier document which are referred to in the later document? As a matter of logic, it seems to us that only that part or those parts of the earlier document which are referred to in the later document should be so read. To go beyond that would be to read into the later document information which played no part in the thesis advanced therein. That would be inconsistent with the general principle that in determining the meaning of a document, regard may be had only to what is stated in the document itself.<br/><br/>We will now turn to consider what were conveyed in the four prior art publications. A brief note should be made in respect of certain nomenclature used in the four publications. All four publications refer to the human AIDS virus as `HTLV-III`. This is the abbreviated term for Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus-III. The human AIDS virus is also referred to at some points as `LAV`. This is the abbreviated term for lymphadenopathy-associated virus.<br/><br/>At the point of these four publications, which were published from 7 June 1985 to 21 December 1985, the viral cause of AIDS had already been identified. This had occurred sometime between 1983 to 1984. There was however some dispute as to who was the first to isolate the AIDS virus and consequently a dispute over who had the right to name the virus. The American team, lead by Professor Richard Gallo, named the virus HTLV-III. The French team, who were lead by Professor Luc Montagnier, named the virus LAV. An international committee subsequently named the virus Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. After the discovery of a second HIV in 1986, the first HIV was renamed HIV-1 and the second named HIV-2.<br/><br/>In Kanki 2 references are made to `gp160` and `gp120`. These are abbreviated terms for a glycoprotein of a certain molecular weight. Glycoproteins are complexes of sugar and protein. The number refers to the molecular weight of the glycoprotein, in kilodalton. Thus gp160 is a complex of sugar and protein with a molecular weight of about 160 kilodalton.<br/><br/>Both Kanki 1 and Daniel were published on 7 June 1985. Kanki 1 reports the identification of a simian retrovirus, STLV-III, from sick macaques. The key excerpts of Kanki 1 are as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Kanki 1</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We report here on the serological identification and characterisation of a new macaque retrovirus that has striking similarities to the human AIDS virus HTLV-III; we therefore refer to it as the simian T-lymphotropic virus of macaques related to HTLV-III (STLV-III) ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Although the high molecular weight glycoproteins of HTLV-III are the most immunogenic antigens in exposed humans, sera from STLV-III antibody-positive macaques showed minimal reactivity to these proteins, indicating an apparent one-way, cross-reactivity of antibodies to these glycoproteins, STLV-III may thus be distinct from HTLV-III, at least to the degree of the type-specific immunoreactivity to the <strong> env</strong>-encoded glycoproteins ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[Concluding paragraph] <strong> The availability of a nonhuman primate naturally infected with a virus related to HTLV-III may facilitate studies of the pathogenesis and treatment or prevention of AIDS</strong>. [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Daniel reports on the isolation of a T-Cell tropic retrovirus from sick macaques. The key excerpts of Daniel are as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Daniel</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Abstract. The isolation of a T-Cell tropic retrovirus from three immunodeficient macaques and one macaque with lymphoma is described. The morphology, growth characteristics, and antigenic properties of this virus indicate that it is related to the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in humans (HTLV-III or LAV). This virus is referred to as simian T-lymphotropic virus type III (STLV-III) of macaques ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[Concluding paragraph] <strong> Studies of the pathogenesis of AIDS as well as the development of an effective vaccine would be aided if HTLV-III had the ability to infect and cause disease in a laboratory animal.

[Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Kanki 2 was published on 22 November 1985. It sets out the discovery of a HIV related retrovirus in the African green monkeys. The key excerpts from Kanki 2 are as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Kanki 2</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Thus, it appears that the high molecular weight glycoproteins of this virus are the most immunogenic species in infected monkeys. A similar observation was made in the human system where the env-encoded gp160 and gp120 of HTLV-III/LAV are the most immunogenic proteins in people exposed to the human virus. ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>These data indicate that healthy African Green monkeys are infected with a retrovirus closely related to HTLV-III, designated STLV-IIIAGM ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The major STLV-IIIAGM viral proteins are similar in molecular weight to the major <strong> gag</strong>- and <strong> env</strong>-encoded proteins of HTLV-III/LAV.

As in the case of HTLV-III infected people, the gp160/120 appear to be the best serological markers for infection by these closely related viruses. These proteins therefore represent the most obvious antigen target for serological screening purposes. In addition, serologic cross-reactivity directed to these presumed env-encoded antigens suggests that conserved regions of these proteins should be evaluated as potential immunogenic epitopes for development of a human AIDS vaccine ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[Concluding paragraph] <strong> Understanding the biology of an HTLV-III related virus in this primate species may</strong> help us to understand the specific viral alterations or viral-host interactions that are involved in the pathogenicity of this family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses and perhaps <strong> provide a new approach in the development of an AIDS vaccine</strong>. [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Finally, on 21 December 1985, the last of the four prior art documents, Barin, was published. It essentially reports the following:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Barin</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Summary ... <strong> These results suggest that certain healthy Senegalese people have been exposed to a virus that is more closely related to STLV-III than to HTLV-III</strong>. The existence and study of such virus variants potentially with different pathogenicity may provide important information for the development of an AIDS virus vaccine ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Our study suggests that people in Senegal, where AIDS has not yet been reported, have also been exposed to viruses of the HTLV-III class. However, the virus we found in some healthy prostitutes and surgical impatients is more closely related to STLV-IIIAGM than to reference strains of HTLV-III ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[Concluding paragraph] <strong> Since the STLV-IIIAGM infection has thus far only been described in healthy African monkeys and the related virus in Senegalese people was apparently present in the absence of recognised AIDS, an evaluation of the virology and the immunobiology of these agents in their respective hosts may provide important clues to the development of an AIDS vaccine</strong>. [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellants argue that the four publications show that at the priority date:   </p>\n    <p>(i) it was already known that there was in existence a virus, the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, or SIV, that infected not just simians but also humans; </p>\n    <p>(ii) that the envelope glycoproteins gp160 and gp120 had been isolated from SIV and the characteristics of these glycoproteins were already known; and </p>\n    <p>(iii) that the SIV envelope glycoproteins that had been isolated were obvious antigen targets for serological screening purposes.<br/><br/>The appellants seek to further support their argument that there was no novelty in the appellants` invention, by arguing that subsequent studies have shown that:   </p>\n    <p>(i) HIV-2 is in fact the same virus as SIV, that is, HIV-2 is in fact a SIV infection in humans; </p>\n    <p>(ii) contrary to the respondents` contention, there are no material differences between HIV-2 and SIV; and </p>\n    <p>(iii) the SIV gp160 and the HIV-2 gp140 are the same.<br/><br/>Consequently, the amino acid sequence of the HIV-2 gp140 and its antigenic effects in respect of the HIV-2 virus, as covered by claim 19, had been anticipated by prior art.<br/><br/>It seems to us that the answer to one assertion made by the appellants is crucial to the question whether there has been anticipation by prior art: has any of the prior art documents shown that SIV had the capacity to infect humans? The answer is no. The prior art documents show that SIV infects simians. Nothing in them indicate that SIV would infect humans with AIDS. It would be seen that Kanki 1 and Daniel reported the isolation of the STLVMAC virus from macaques and Kanki 2 reported the isolation of a variant STLVAGM from African green monkeys.<br/><br/>Barin studied certain Senegalese people and that study showed that while those Senegalese were exposed to a virus that was more closely related to STLV-III than to HTLV-III, the Senegalese remained healthy and exhibited no signs of recognised AIDs. Barin, also having noted from Kanki 2 that STLV-IIIAGM had infected only African monkeys who remained healthy, came to the conclusion that `an evaluation of the virology and the immunobiology of these agents in their respective hosts may provide important clues to the development of an AIDs vaccine.`<br/><br/>Admittedly, and as pointed out by the appellants, there is a latency period between initial infection and onset of the disease and AIDs would take a long time to manifest. Still, it is important to bear in mind what was the message that Barin intended to impart. And that document should be construed as at the date of its publication, and one must exclude in that consideration information subsequently discovered: see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ore Concentration Co (1905) Ltd v Sulphide Corp Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1914] 31 RPC 206</font> at 224. Barin never suggested that the Senegalese people could have contracted AIDS from a virus other than HIV-1 and that they did not show any signs of suffering from AIDS because of a long latency period. We should not seek to impute to Barin a proposition which was never advanced, and which is really an ex post facto rationalisation in the light of later discovery.<br/><br/>What these researchers were studying was why strains of viruses similar to HIV did not cause AIDS in primates or humans. From there, they hoped to develop a vaccine for the HIV virus. There is no question of any of those prior art documents indicating that there was another strain of HIV virus which could infect humans.<br/><br/>The appellants say that there was an imputation that SIV could cause AIDS in humans because Daniel and Kanki 2 had reported that the SIV infects and  injures the human HUT-78 cell. The HUT-78 is a cell line developed in 1980. A cell line is a particular type of cell which is used in immunologic research. Normal human cells generally have a finite life span in culture. After a certain period of time, the cells stop dividing. In contrast, normal cells that have undergone transformation, by for example chemical carcinogens or viruses, can be propagated indefinitely in tissue culture. Such cells are referred to as cell lines.<br/><br/>In the case of HUT-78, the cell line originated with a patient diagnosed with Sezary Syndrome, a type of lymphoid leukemia. It is a cell which has been infected by leukemia and transformed such that it propagates indefinitely, contrary to normal cell behaviour. It was through the use of the HUT-78 cell line that scientists were able to grow the HIV in sufficient mass quantity for diagnosis kits using HIV antigens to become viable. In Daniel and Kanki 2, HUT-78 cell lines were used to culture SIV.<br/><br/>The remarks of Professor Cohen, the respondent`s expert, on this issue, is pertinent. Professor Cohen was referred to a line in Kanki 2 which said that a cytopathic effect was observed in the HUT-78 cell lines after 7 to 28 days of culturing SIVAGM. The cross examination is as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>Q: Reading the two passages there, do you agree that it was known that SIVs are cytopathic to T4 cells?  </p>\n        <p>A: A SIV is demonstrated to be cytopathic in HUT-78 ...</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Professor Cohen`s emphasis was that all that Kanki 2 showed was that SIV was cytopathic to HUT-78, which is a cell line. He did not agree that Kanki 2 showed that SIV was cytopathic to T4 cells, which are the helper T-lymphocyte cells of the body. He went on to observe:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Cytopathic-means something harmful to a cell, able to kill a cell. Cellular level. Pathogenic-refers to something inducing a disease in a living animal or man. If a virus that kills a cell in a laboratory, i.e. cytopathic, it does not mean it will also be pathogenic to man.`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Indeed, if the culturing of SIV in HUT-78 cell lines meant that humans could acquire AIDS from SIV, Kanki 1 and Daniel would have ended with the pronouncement that SIV could cause AIDS in humans, rather than that the study of SIV could lead to the development of an AIDS vaccine. It is also noteworthy that Professor Letvin, who was a co-author of Daniel, did not anywhere in his evidence offer the view that SIV was shown to infect humans merely on the basis of SIV infection of HUT-78 cell lines. Professor Letvin himself had written in an article entitled `In vitro growth characteristics of simian T-lymphotropic virus type II` published in October 1985 that:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Abstract ... STLV-III differs from the human AIDs virus [in certain respects] ... and its less striking toxicity for T lymphocytes. These studies provide further characterisation of an agent that will be extremely important in facilitating the development of vaccines and antiviral therapy for AIDS.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In summary, the four prior art documents relied on by the appellants did not indicate that SIV could infect humans with AIDS. They could not and did not inevitably lead to the discovery of another HIV and the method of detecting it. Instead the prior art documents relied on led away from it, towards a non-pathogenic virus with hopes of developing of a vaccine for HIV-1.<br/><br/>The position here is unlike that of <strong><i> Merrell Dow </i></strong>. There the House of Lords found that knowledge of the acid metabolite had been made available to the public by the terfenadine specification under the description `a part of the chemical reaction in the human body produced by the ingestion of terfenadine and having an anti-histamine effect`. This enabled the public to work the invention by making the acid metabolite in their livers. The fact that they were not able to describe the chemical reaction in these terms did not mean that they were not working on the invention. In sharp contrast, not only did the four publications fail to describe a process that involves the HIV-2, they did not even predict its existence.<br/><br/>Therefore, there is no basis for the appellants to argue that the HIV-2 and the antigenic component covered by claim 19 were anticipated by prior art. In relation to the novelty of claim 19 in particular, as at 22 January 1986, there was nothing in the prior art that described the 18mer sequence set out in claim 19.<br/><br/>We, therefore, agree with the following conclusion reached by the trial judge in [para ] 191 and 192 of his grounds of decision:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... the prior art documents relied on by the defendants, read individually or collectively, do not clearly and unmistakeably disclose any antigen having the amino acid sequence or a part thereof as described in Claim 19. The said Claim also deals with the function of detecting HIV-2. Claims 1 to 9 on the novelty of the HIV-2 have not been impugned. It would therefore be illogical to claim that prior art has already revealed the function of detecting a virus unknown to the prior art.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Claim 33 is concerned with a process to detect a new virus. As stated above, if the virus is new or novel, the process to detect it must have the same attribute.`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the premises, we hold that the contention of the appellants based on lack of novelty fails.<br/><br/><strong><i> Inventive step </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The second requirement which an invention must fulfil to be patentable is that it involves an inventive step. Section 15 of the Act provides that an invention shall be taken to involve an inventive step if it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art, having regard to any matter which formed part of the state of the art. This requirement, which is termed as the question of obviousness, is distinct and separate from novelty. An invention lacks novelty if it is shown that the patent claimed includes within its scope something which has previously been made available to the public. On the other hand, in considering the question of obviousness, it is assumed that the invention is novel and differs in some identifiable respect from the prior art. The question to ask is whether it is obvious and hence did not involve any inventive step to devise a product or process falling within the scope of the claim in question. In <strong><i> Molnlycke AB v Procter &amp; Gamble Ltd </i></strong> (No 5) [1994] RPC 49, Donald Nicholls VC explained the matter as follows (at p 112).  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Under the statutory code (which is further confirmed in its completeness by ss 74 and 72) the criterion for deciding whether or not the claimed invention involves an inventive step is wholly objective. It is an objective criterion defined in statutory terms, that is to say whether the step was obvious to a person skilled in the art.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The statute has laid down what the criterion is to be: it is a qualitative not a quantitative test.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The Act requires the court to make a finding of fact as to what was, at the priority date, included in the state of the art and then to find again as a fact whether, having regard to that state of the art, the alleged inventive step would be obvious to a person skilled in the art.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>As regards the appropriate approach which the court should take in determining the issue of inventive step, this was elucidated earlier by Oliver LJ in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Windsurfing International v Tabur Marine (Great Britain)</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1985]  RPC 59</font> where his Lordship set out a four-step approach, as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>There are, we think, four steps which require to be taken in answering the jury question. The first is to identify the inventive concept embodied in the patent in suit. Thereafter, the court has to assume the mantle of the normally skilled but unimaginative addressee in the art at the priority date and to impute to him what was, at that date, common general knowledge in the art in question. The third step is to identify what, if any, differences exist between the matter cited as being `known or used` and the alleged invention. Finally, the court has to ask itself whether, viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention, those differences constitute steps which would have been obvious to the skilled man or whether they require any degree of invention.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>This four-step approach advocated by Oliver LJ was adopted by this court in the recent case <strong><i> Merck v Pharmaforte </i></strong> (supra).<br/><br/>The appellants accept that the inventive step which the trial judge found was `the discovery of an antigen having the stated amino acid consequence which was capable of specifically bringing about the solution of a newly discovered problem, ie the HIV-2.` But they argue that the trial judge misunderstood the problem and the solution as he did not pay sufficient regard to the state of the art at the priority date from the mantle of the person skilled in the art. In short, the trial judge did not apply the second step advocated by Oliver LJ in <strong><i> Windsurfing International </i></strong> correctly.<br/><br/>It seems to us that the very foundation for this argument is based on the assertion that the prior art in hand indicated that SIV was pathogenic to man. Following from that premise, the appellants say that the respondents` contribution was essentially in locating or having access to patients exhibiting outward symptoms of AIDS, but who either could not or were not detected as positive by conventional HIV-1 antibody tests, and that such a contribution does not constitute an inventive step.<br/><br/>In arguing that SIV is pathogenic to man, the appellants rely again on the four prior art publications, Kanki 1, Daniel, Kanki 2 and Barin. As discussed earlier in relation to the question of novelty, none of these prior documents did so suggest. It seems to us that this contention clearly smacks of ex post facto rationalization, based on new discovery made after the publication of the four documents. This thread seems to run through much of the appellants` submission. Even on the appellants` own submission the highest they could go was `there was a possibility to which the scientific community had been alerted to of a new retrovirus.` How could something which was only a possibility be translated into something  `obvious to a person skilled in the art to use routine laboratory methods then available to isolate the SIV strains`?<br/><br/>The appellants seek to latch on to a comment by Professor Cohen where he said `by the end of the race, first plaintiff got there first` to argue that `if it had been so implausible, so impossible to ..., why would there be a competition at all to find the virus which was pathogenic to man?` That remark by Professor Cohen was clearly a general remark in relation to the law governing patent, namely, that the first person who made the invention would get the prize of a patent. The scientists may be working broadly in the same direction or they may not. But we do not think that Professor Cohen was in any way suggesting that Barin and others were, in fact, in the same race, bearing in mind that just a few questions before that remark, Professor Cohen had said `by 19 December 1985, the virus from the first plaintiff had been registered in the depository. Barin was going the wrong way, looking for non-pathogenic virus`.<br/><br/>Thus, we are unable to agree with the appellants` contention that what was invented was obvious and that no inventive step was involved.<br/><br/><strong><i> Insufficiency </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now turn to the next issue - the question of sufficiency of disclosure. A new patent is invalid if the specification does not disclose the invention with sufficient particularity to enable the invention to be understood and carried into effect by a person skilled in the art: see s 80(1)(c) of the Act.<br/><br/>In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Mentor Corp &amp; Anor v Hollister Inc</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1993]  RPC 7</font>, the Court of Appeal held that whether the specification of a patent disclosed the invention clearly enough and completely enough for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art was a question of degree. It would be impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule. In each case the question of sufficiency would be a matter of fact, depending on the nature of the invention and the other circumstances of the case. Lloyd LJ, who delivered the judgment of the court, explained the point in this manner (at pp 10-11):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The question for decision in the present case is whether the specification discloses the invention clearly enough and completely enough for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art. This obviously involves a question of degree. Disclosure of an invention does not have to be complete in every detail, so that anyone, whether skilled or not, can perform it. Since the specification is addressed to the skilled man, it is sufficient if the addressee can understand the invention as described, and can then perform it. In performing the invention the skilled man does not have to be told what is self-evident, or what is part of common general knowledge, that is to say, what is known to persons versed in the art. But then comes the difficulty. How much else may the skilled man be expected to do for himself? Is he to be able to produce what Mr Thorley called a workable prototype of the invention at his first attempt? Or may he be required to carry out further research or at least make some further enquiries before achieving success? And how does one draw the line between production of the so-called workable prototype and the subsequent development or `optimisation` of the commercial product?</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In determining the required degree of clarity and completeness it is plainly impossible to lay down any precise rule.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>But even if it were possible to lay down a hard and fast rule, I doubt if it would be desirable. For the amount of teaching required in the specification may vary from invention to invention. Where the gist of the invention is an idea, less may be required by way of teaching to produce a workable prototype than where the invention is a new method of manufacture. It is dangerous to generalise.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Claim 19 covers a sequence of 891 amino acids or part thereof, which raise a specific immunological reaction with HIV-2 antibodies. It is common ground that the amino acid sequence in claim 19 is that of the envelope glycoprotein, gp140, of the HIV-2. The appellants argue that there is insufficiency of disclosure because the claim does not disclose which part of the amino acid sequence will raise the specific reaction. The respondent counter that immuno-reactive epitopes, that is, portions of the sequence that react specifically to antibodies of given specificity, can be selected using the amino acid sequence disclosed in claim 19 together with four other pieces of information which were common general knowledge at priority date. These are:   </p>\n    <p>(i) the teaching in the patent that the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-2 is considered the best target antigen in terms of detection efficiency; </p>\n    <p>(ii) a patent of Professor Richard Gallo in 1984 which revealed that the HIV-1 envelope transmembrane protein p 41 was useful in finding antigens; </p>\n    <p>(iii) an article by Chang et al in October 1985 that an 82 amino acid peptide from gp41 of HIV-1 successfully detected 99% of HIV-1 patients; </p>\n    <p>(iv) the disclosure by Geysen et al in July 1984 of the Pepscan as a method of identifying epitopes.<br/><br/>The answer of the appellants` expert, Professor Letvin, disposes of this issue:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>Q: <strong><i> Once we have the four pieces of information listed, it would be possible for a skilled man to find the immuno-dominant antigens in a virus once the virus has been sequenced? </i></strong>  </p>\n        <p>A: <strong><i> That`s fine. </i></strong></p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>Q: Put: Without the sequences revealed in the patent and subsequently published in Guyader, this 18mer used by the defendants would not have been obtained.  </p>\n        <p>A: That is correct. Again, it is an issue of law not science as to whether the definition of a protein of a virus takes precedence over the sequencing of that protein. That is not a scientific question.  </p>\n        <p>Q: <strong><i> A skilled man has the knowledge to look for the 18mer once the sequence of the HIV-2 virus was revealed? </i></strong>  </p>\n        <p>A: <strong><i> Yes </i></strong>. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The contention of the appellants on this issue is that there was insufficient disclosure because the immuno-reactive portions of the 891 amino acid sequence was not disclosed. Such a contention has no credibility in the light of their expert`s agreement that with knowledge of the sequence and the four pieces of common general knowledge, it was possible to get the epitope known as the 18mer.<br/><br/><strong><i> Was there infringement </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The next contention of the appellants is that their diagnostic kits do not infringe the patent. It is clear that to determine whether there is infringement, there must first be determined the scope of the monopoly claimed in the patent. The appellants submit that the trial judge failed to appreciate that claim 19 was drafted rather widely, so much so that it would encompass even SIV antigens, which could not have been intended. They refer to a letter of EPO dated 22 April 1988 wherein the first respondent was advised that:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(i) In claims 14 to 17, it would be appropriate to specify the antibodies which can be used to recognise the portions of the sequences claimed, and to <strong><i> exclude any polypeptide or peptide presenting homologies of sequences with those of the known HIV or SIV viruses which are liable to be recognised by the same antibodies </i></strong>. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In answer to that query, the respondents on 21 June 1988 stated:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>There is no need to emphasise that nothing of the sort has been contemplated in the previous documents. <strong> These do not describe the polypeptides or peptides of an SIV retrovirus</strong> corresponding to the definition given in claims 15 to 18. [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the light of this response, the appellants contend that claim 19 must be restricted to HIV-2 and should not include SIV. In the case of the appellants` Blot 2.2 diagnostic kit, it does not infringe claim 19 because it uses the amino acid sequence of an SIV antigen.<br/><br/>It would be seen that the position taken by the respondents was that the invention opened a novel domain, and that under the usual directions of EPO, the respondents are entitled to broad claims. Moreover, we must also point out, as was done by the respondents in their case, that the complete response of the respondents of 21 June 1988 gives a different picture from that sought to be painted by the appellants. The appellants have misunderstood it. Thus, there is a need for us to quote that part of the letter in full:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <strong> We would like to insist on the fact that, as the Examiner recognised in para 2 of the Official Letter, the object of the claims is new and inventive as regards to what relates to the new species of retrovirus having the characteristics stated in the application</strong>.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <strong> There is no need to emphasise that nothing of the sort has been contemplated in the previous documents. These do not describe the polypeptides or peptides of a SIV retrovirus corresponding to the definition given in claims 15 to 18. This is why it seems to us that the meaning of claims stated above ought not to be limited to the sole sequences of amino acids deriving from the HIV2 retrovirus</strong>.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <strong> We think that the examiner will subscribe to general formulation of the claims, which is certainly quite general because an invention `which opens up an entirely new area has the right to word claims in more general terms than an invention which only concerns progress made in a known technique`, in the words of Directive C III 6.2</strong>.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <strong> The present patent application corresponds to a situation of this type, since its object resides in the characterisation of a new species of virus and its various constitutive elements, no characteristics of which proceeds in an obvious from the instructions of documents of the prior art documents as the Examiner has recognised</strong>. [Parts not cited by the appellants are underlined.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Therefore, we agree with the respondents that there is nothing in their letter of 21 June 1988 which narrows down their entitlement to only HIV-2 antigens and excluding SIV antigens. In any event, it is not established that the 18mer used by the appellants in their diagnostic kits are that of the SIV. It is acknowledged that the 18mer of the SIV gp160 has one amino acid difference from the 18mer of the HIV-2 gp140. It contains at one point, serine instead of alanine. The appellants argue however that this one amino acid difference is immaterial to the immuno-reactive character of the SIV 18mer. Be that as it may, the point is that the 18mer used is not that of the SIV, but instead corresponds exactly with that of the HIV-2 gp140, as covered by claim 19.<br/><br/>It is settled law that a patent claim should be construed purposively which would accord fair protection to the patentee and yet provide a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties: see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1982]  RPC 183</font>. The application of this principle was further elucidated by Hoffman J in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Improver Corp v Remington Consumer Products Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1990]  FSR 181</font> as follows (at p 188):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The language should be given a `purposive` and not necessarily a literal construction. If the issue was whether a feature embodied in an alleged infringement which fell outside the primary, literal or a contexual meaning of a descriptive word or phrase in the claim (`a variant`) was nevertheless within its language as properly interpreted, the court should ask itself the following three questions:</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(1) Does the variant have a material effect upon the way the invention works? If yes, the variant is outside the claim. If no -  </p>\n        <p>(2) Would this (ie the variant had no material effect) have been obvious at the date of publication of the patent to a reader skilled in the art. If no, the variant is outside the claim. If yes -  </p>\n        <p>(3) Would the readers skilled in the art nevertheless have understood from the language of the claim that the patentee intended that strict compliance with the primary meaning was an essential requirement of the invention. If yes, the variant is outside the claim.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>On the other hand, a negative answer to the last question would lead to the conclusion that the patentee was intending the word or phrase to have not a literal but a figurative meaning (the figure being a form of synecdoche or metonymy) denoting a class of things which included the variant and the literal meaning, the latter being perhaps the most perfect, best-known or striking example of the class.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We note that the appellants have only submitted on the alleged infringement of Blot 2.2 diagnostic kit; nothing has been said about Blot 1.2. It would follow from this absence of response that they admit to Blot 1.2 being in infringement, as evidence was led by the respondents that Blot 1.2, as well as Blot 2.2, infringed the patent.<br/><br/>As regards the Blot 2.2 diagnostic kit, it clearly contains the exact same 18mer sequence specified in claim 19 and raises the specific immunological reaction required by claim 19. Thus, the respondents submit that that kit literally infringes claims 19 and 33. Even if consideration should be given to the five extra amino acids, ie 23mer, this is an immaterial variant since those extra acids are no more than a sticking agent, ie a superglue to stick the peptide onto the nitrocellulose strip.<br/><br/>The Blot 2.2 diagnostic kit purports to be a qualitative enzyme immuno-essay for the in vitro detection of, inter alia, antibodies to HIV-2 in human serum or plasma. If HIV-2 antibodies are present in a serum, they will bind with the immobilized antigen on the nitrocellulose strip, thus forming an immunological conjugate, also known as an immunological complex. The immunological conjugate can be detected by using a colouring agent. It seems to us that Blot 2.2 entails a process which falls, in the word of the respondents, `squarely` within claim 33.<br/><br/>The question of infringement is a question of fact. There is clear evidence from the witnesses for the respondents, Professor Cohen and Mr Gallochat, stating that Blot 2.2, as well as Blot 1.2, infringed the patent. The learned trial judge accepted Professor Cohen`s evidence in this respect. There is hardly any sufficient basis for us to interfere with such a finding.<br/><br/><strong><i> Laches and acquiescence </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The basis upon which the appellants raise the defence of acquiescence is that the respondents knew of the appellants` involvement in the production of diagnostic kits for the detection of HIV-2 since December 1993. The appellants say the respondents had such knowledge because of a letter of 23 December 1993 written by the respondents to the appellants` parent company in these terms, following the termination of negotiations to grant a licence to the appellants` parent company:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Referring to our various conversation concerning an HIV2 license agreement, we notify you our decision to put an end to our negotiation regarding PSD territory HIV2 rights for Genelabs or its affiliate Diagnostics Biotechnology.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>As a result, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that if your company <strong> continues</strong>, directly or indirectly through the medium of any affiliate, to manufacture and/or sell products which could infringe our rights, it does so at its own risk, as we are committed to take whatever legal action is necessary to protect and enforce our valuable rights. [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellants place emphasis on the word `continues` in the letter, which suggested that the appellants had already infringed the patent. However, the respondents had, through their witness, explained that this was their standard form warning issued to all potential infringers, and nothing more should not be read into it.<br/><br/>The appellants claim that they have been selling their kits in Europe, including France, since 1987. The appellants further say that they have advertised in numerous publication in which the respondents` licencees had also advertised and therefore, the respondents must have known what the appellants were producing. There were also articles written about their kits. The appellants submit that in the light of all these, it would be unjust to grant to the respondents the relief as the appellants have in the meantime incurred substantial costs on research, development and promotion of their kits.<br/><br/>It should be noted that there is no concrete evidence of such alleged sales of the kits since 1987. As regards the advertisements, their contents were less than  specific. The articles too did not say that the product was commercially available and was being sold to the public.<br/><br/>In any event, the crucial question in this regard is whether mere knowledge of infringement and failure to take action to prevent such infringement is sufficient to establish acquiescence. Here the respondents rely on  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Farmers Build v Carier Bulk Materials Handling Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1999]  RPC 461</font> to assert that the answer is in the negative. There, the Court of Appeal approved the following statement of the law set out in 16 <strong><i> Halsbury`s Laws of England </i></strong> (4th Ed Reissue) para 924.  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The term acquiescence is ... properly used where a person having a right and seeing another person about to commit, or in the course of committing an act infringing that right, stands by in such a manner as really to induce the person committing the act and who might otherwise have abstained from it, to believe that he consents to its being committed; a person so standing-by cannot afterwards be heard to complain of the act. In that sense the doctrine of acquiescence may be defined as quiescence under such circumstances that assent may reasonably be inferred from it and is no more than an instance of the law of estoppel by words or conduct ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The respondents further argue that acquiescence cannot be applied in this case because:   </p>\n    <p>(i) they have always told the appellants that they would sue if the appellants infringed their patent; </p>\n    <p>(ii) they have warned the appellants and their subsidiaries/affiliates on many occasions that they would sue, and at no time did they indicate that they would not enforce their rights; </p>\n    <p>(iii) the appellants` witness, Mark Van Asten, admitted that they had never been misled by the respondents` conduct or representation.<br/><br/>We agree that, in the circumstances of this case, the defence of acquiescence can hardly apply. What the appellants have failed to show is that the respondents had `(stood) by in such a manner as really to induce the person committing the act and who might otherwise have abstained from it, to believe that he consents to its being committed.` We cannot see how the appellants could claim that they genuinely believed that the respondents consented to the infringement. It seems to us that the circumstances suggest that the appellants were quite determined to carry on with what they had been doing irrespective of whether what they did amounted to an infringement of the respondents` patent. To permit the plea of acquiescence in such circumstances would be to permit a defendant to take advantage of its own deliberate wrongdoing. Furthermore, there is no evidence on how the appellants` position had changed on account of the alleged acquiescence. If it were true that the appellants had manufactured and sold their kits in as early as 1987, as they said they had, then the appellants cannot claim that their position had changed post-negotiation. As the respondents` witnesses (Mr Policard) explained, the letter of 23 December 1993 was a standard form letter. It did not mean that the respondents knew that the first appellant was then infringing the patent. The evidence showed that the respondents knew the appellants were planning to infringe. This would follow very much from the fact that the appellants were negotiating for a licence. But that does not amount to knowing that the appellants had already infringed. Furthermore, the respondents had, in fact, warned the appellants not to infringe.<br/><br/>The way the appellants put their case would appear to suggest that there is a duty on a patent proprietor to keep a constant look out for potential infringers. We endorse the view of the trial judge that `there is no duty on the part of the proprietors of patents to scan and survey the market constantly and vigilantly for infringers and to pounce on them immediately when they are sighted`.<br/><br/>A related point in this regard is whether the respondents had been guilty of laches after discovering that the appellants had infringed their patents. There is evidence to suggest that it was only in late 1996 that the respondents discovered that the appellants had manufactured and sold the kits in Singapore on a commercial basis. The present action was commenced against the appellants on 5 October 1998. Bearing in mind that the respondents have no representative office here and had to set up trap-purchases, carry out the necessary analysis and tests, and appoint solicitors and other agents in Singapore, the delay before instituting the action cannot be said to be inordinate. We agree with the trial judge that the respondents did not know of the infringing activities of the appellants until sometime in 1996 and they had proceeded with reasonable despatch thereafter. Furthermore, for reasons indicated earlier, we do not see any prejudice being caused to the appellants on account of the delay in instituting the action.<br/><br/><strong><i> Non-Registration under s 75 </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The final point raised by the appellants concerns s 75 of the Act which require, inter alia, that an agreement conferring an exclusive licence upon another be registered within six months of the agreement. To understand the full import of the section we will quote it in extenso:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Where by virtue of the transaction, instrument or event to which section 43 applies a person becomes the proprietor or one of the proprietors or an exclusive licensee of a patent and the patent is subsequently infringed, the court or the Registrar shall not award him damages or order that he be given an account of the profits in respect of such a subsequent infringement occurring before the transaction, instrument or event is registered unless -</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(a) the transaction, instrument or event is registered within the period of 6 months beginning with its date; or  </p>\n        <p>(b) the court or the Registrar is satisfied that it was not practicable to register the transaction, instrument or event before the end of that period and that it was registered as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the present case, the second respondent had become the exclusive licencees of the patent by virtue of a collaboration agreement dated 26 March 1981 and which agreement was renewed on 11 June 1990. The collaboration agreement was only registered on 1 June 1999, shortly before the commencement of the trial of this action.<br/><br/>The trial judge noted that this point was not pleaded or alluded to in the course of the trial. In any case, he held that s 75 could not have been intended to apply to past transactions such as the document in question here as the Act only came into force on 23 February 1995 (operative date). The previous statute did not contain a similar provision though there was a provision there which required  registration of the agreement and the penalty for non-registration was inadmissibility of the document in court as evidence.<br/><br/>The first time this question was raised by the appellants was in their closing submission at the trial. We agree with the respondents` submission that they were prejudiced by the appellants` lateness in bringing up the point. This is because s 75 also provides that the penalty prescribed therein will not apply if `the court is satisfied that it was not practicable to register the transaction ... before the end of (the six month period) and that it was registered as soon as practicable thereafter.` The respondents were deprived of an opportunity to adduce evidence to satisfy the court that s 75 did not apply or, if it did, it had been complied with. Thus, we are of the view that the appellants should be precluded from raising the point.<br/><br/>However, as fairly extensive arguments have been submitted on the applicability of s 75 to this case, we shall briefly indicate our views. The general question that arises for consideration is whether s 75 would apply to `transactions, instruments or events`, which occurred before the operative date. Section 43(3) defines that term to cover, inter alia, assignments, mortgages, licences, devolution upon death or orders of court. The Act also contains a number of transitional provisions. The one relied upon by the appellants is s 116(3) and it reads:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Any certificate of registration issued under section 5 of the Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act and is in force immediately before 23rd February 1995, or issued after that date by virtue of subsection (1) or (2) shall continue in force and the patent to which the certificate relates shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as if it were a patent under this Act granted in pursuance of an application made under this Act and the proprietor of the patent shall accordingly have the same rights, remedies, privileges and obligations and subject to the same conditions (including the payment of any fee prescribed under section 36), as the proprietor of a patent under this Act subject to the following modifications:</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(a) the term of the patent shall date from the date of the patent in the United Kingdom and the patent shall subject to this Act remain in force for 20 years from that date and only so long as the patent has not been revoked in the United Kingdom;  </p>\n        <p>(b) such other modifications as may be prescribed.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The essence of s 116(3) is to say that the proprietor of a patent granted under the previous Act shall be treated as if it were granted under the 1994 Act and the proprietor shall, subject to those specified modifications, enjoy the same rights, remedies, etc, as those of a proprietor of a patent granted under the 1994 Act. It seems to us that s 116(3) has really nothing to do with the assignment of or devolution of a proprietor`s rights to a patent or the grant of an exclusive licence. It would be stretching the sense of s 116(3) too far to argue that the words `obligations and subject to the same conditions` therein could conceivably be interpreted to imply that s 75 would apply to an assignment made or an exclusive licence granted before the operative date. In our opinion, if the Legislature really had that in mind it would have stated so in clearer terms and would also have provided for two different situations which could arise, namely, those cases where on the operative date the six month period had expired and those cases where it had not. We feel justified in taking this view when we see that in the other subsections of s 116 detailed provisions on time frames are set out.<br/><br/>Accordingly, we would be inclined to hold that s 75 has no retrospective operation. It certainly can have no application to a case where the six month period had expired on the operative date. It must be borne in mind that s 75(b) refers to an extension of time to register when `it was not practical to register the transaction, instrument or event.` The word `practical` would suggest that what is required to be done is an act which is `possible` but not `practical`. But where, as in this case, on the operative date, the six month period had long passed, it is absurd to suggest that the non-registration was because it was not `practical`. It was simply not required. Of course, we recognise that the force of this line of argument is less absolute when the `transaction, instrument or event` took place less than six months before the operative date because in such a situation it may be `possible` but not `practical` to effect the registration within the six month period. It could be just one day before the six month period is due to expire or it could be that there were still five months twenty nine days to go. What is the answer to each of these situations is less than clear. Thus, it is really necessary for us to go back to basics. We need to bear in mind two things. First, if the legislature had intended to apply s 75 to `transactions, instruments or events` which occurred before the operative date, why did it not lay down detailed provisions? Second, it is a rule of construction that the legislature must not be deemed to have intended to affect existing rights unless by express provisions. When the Patents Bill was under consideration in Parliament, the Minister for Law informed Parliament that `the repeal of this legislation of UK Patents Act ... will not affect rights already granted under the current law.` Under the previous law the penalty for non-registration was just inadmissibility of the document in court as evidence of title to a patent or licence, `unless the court otherwise directs`. No time limit was prescribed for such registration.<br/><br/>In any event, in so far as this case is concerned, s 75 can have no application whatsoever.<br/><br/><strong><i> Judgment </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In the premises, we agree with the trial judge that the patent is valid and that it is infringed by the appellants` actions. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs and with the usual consequential orders.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n    <p>Appeal dismissed.<br/><br/></p>\n  </body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

However, when a party intends to rely on a settlement as a basis to recover a claim in damages against an upstream defaulter in a liability chain, the courts have to strike an appropriate balance between upholding settlements and assessing the reasonableness of \u201cimposing\u201d a settlement on the ultimate payee, who may not strictly be privy to that settlement. It cannot be right for defaulting parties to be invariably bound by settlements which they are not privy to and have not been consulted about, particularly if liability is still an issue to be resolved.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Singapore is an international centre for outsourcing and contract manufacturing. There can be little doubt that the reliability of settlements is often the cornerstone of many commercial arrangements and transactions. The legitimacy that the law will accord to settlements is also of great importance in other multiparty transactions, especially in construction contracts. The resolution of satellite litigation in such a multiparty setting is often fraught with complexity and uncertainty. While the ideal situation will be to resolve all disputes and issues contemporaneously, commercial reality often dictates otherwise. Some claims cannot be crystallised until downstream parties have resolved their disputes. The courts must, therefore, engage in a cautious and scrupulous appraisal when reviewing settlements so as not to impede or deter the use of such a convenient and cost-effective extra-judicial mechanism for resolving commercial difficulties, while ensuring, at the same time, that contractual defaulters are neither unnecessarily nor unfairly penalised.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The present proceedings raise squarely an important issue as to the circumstances in which a court may uphold a settlement that a party is seeking to rely on against a third party who has not been directly involved in the earlier settlement process. Must the courts choose only between two stark choices, <i>ie</i>, <i>the</i> <i>principle</i> that a party must prove its losses by establishing through direct evidence what its precise losses are on the one hand and <i>the</i> <i>pragmatism</i> that encourages the courts to support the sensible extra-judicial resolution of disputes on the other? Is it not open to the courts to approach the resolution of such a conundrum with <i>principled</i> <i>pragmatism</i>? Can it not be said that the principle of proving loss <i>finds expression</i> in the courts\u2019 scrutiny of the downstream settlement contracts for reasonableness? Ultimately, if liability is not an issue, the true loss suffered by such claimants is in fact <i>equivalent</i> to the settlement amount. The courts, in examining the reasonableness of these settlements, are in effect confirming and ensuring that these settlement amounts reasonably reflect the quantum of loss suffered by the claimants. In this sense then, the twin concepts of reasonableness and proof of actual loss are intertwined and, in reality, represent different sides of the same coin. Before we proceed to discuss the applicable law, it would be appropriate to turn first to the facts of the present case.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The facts</font></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Britestone Pte Ltd (\u201cthe appellant\u201d) is a company incorporated in Singapore which sources electronic components from traders, distributors and manufacturers for its clients.

On 25\u00a0September 2003, CTL additionally claimed that the capacitors were inherently defective.

The respondent initially requested to pay CTL US$200,000 by way of a credit memo and US$100,000 in cash. This was rejected by CTL, which insisted that the respondent pay at least US$150,000 in cash. On 13\u00a0September 2004, the respondent paid CTL the sum of US$150,000 by way of a wire transfer, and on 15\u00a0September 2004, the respondent paid CTL a further US$150,000 by way of a credit memo against CTL\u2019s outstanding account receivables due to the respondent.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the period of negotiations between CTL and the respondent, the respondent repeatedly attempted to contact the appellant to involve it in the ongoing settlement discussions with a view towards seeking a contribution from it to the settlement amount. On 11\u00a0June 2004 and 4\u00a0August 2004 respectively, the respondent sent letters to the appellant seeking payment of the settlement sum of US$300,000, but there was no reply from the appellant. On 29\u00a0September 2004, the respondent\u2019s solicitors sent a letter to the appellant to demand payment of US$309,776 by 8\u00a0October 2004. On 8\u00a0October 2004, the appellant\u2019s solicitors finally responded to the respondent\u2019s solicitors stating that the appellant would not accede to the respondent\u2019s demand and seeking documentary proof to support the respondent\u2019s claim. More significantly, in the same letter, the appellant\u2019s solicitors said that the appellant was \u201cnot notified of the purpose for which [the respondent] had purchased tantalum capacitors from [the appellant]\u201d. This stance has been maintained in these proceedings by Tan Mee Yee (\u201cTan\u201d), the appellant\u2019s sales manager, who asserted that the respondent did not expressly inform her that it required the capacitors for resale to its customers to manufacture printed circuit boards.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1\u00a0November 2004, the respondent\u2019s solicitors replied to the appellant\u2019s solicitors and furnished the appellant with several documents, including e-mails from AVX Corporation to CTL evidencing that the capacitors were counterfeit, the settlement agreement between CTL and the respondent as well as the credit memo and the wire transfer confirmation evidencing payment of the settlement sum of US$300,000. The appellant\u2019s solicitors, on 9\u00a0November 2004, wrote to the respondent\u2019s solicitors denying the allegations that the capacitors which the appellant had supplied were counterfeit. The appellant\u2019s solicitors requested for more documents, including clarification as to how the respondent had computed the alleged settlement sum of US$300,000. On 2\u00a0December 2004, the respondent\u2019s solicitors wrote to the appellant\u2019s solicitors asserting that the respondent\u2019s efforts in achieving an amicable settlement for the parties\u2019 mutual benefit were not being satisfactorily addressed.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent commenced proceedings against the appellant on 16\u00a0February 2005, alleging that the appellant had breached an implied condition of the contract under s\u00a013 of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap\u00a0393, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed) in failing to ensure that the capacitors would conform to the description \u201cAVX\u201d and the required part number \u201cTPSC336K016R0300\u201d. The respondent claimed the settlement sum of US$300,000 that it had paid to CTL as well as US$2,184 as loss of profits. Ultimately, on 20\u00a0March 2006, both parties agreed to a consent judgment by which the appellant admitted liability for the damage caused, leaving the issue of quantum to be assessed by the court.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the hearing for assessment of damages, the assistant registrar awarded damages in the sum of US$302,184 in the respondent\u2019s favour. In addressing the issue of remoteness, Tan attempted to disavow knowledge of the use of the capacitors in printed circuit boards. The assistant registrar, however, accepted the testimony of John Bernhardt Prymmer\u00a0III, the respondent\u2019s managing director, who stated during cross-examination that the capacitors were used to control the flow of electricity on these boards and \u201c[o]n their own \u2026 they do nothing\u201d. We find it helpful to also refer to the assistant registrar\u2019s grounds of decision in <span class=\"title1\"><i>Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd v Britestone Pte Ltd</i><nobr>[2006] SGHC 186</nobr> (\u201cGD\u201d).</span>She held (GD at [40]) that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">It [was] surely within the [appellant\u2019s] contemplation that the capacitors [might] be sold from customer to customer, and ultimately be used in relation to a [printed circuit board] or some other related use.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the issue of the reasonableness of the settlement reached between the respondent and CTL, the assistant registrar found that there had been sufficient legal advice in the circumstances and held (GD at [48]) that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[A]n in-house legal counsel would certainly seek to settle the claim at the lowest possible quantum. \u2026 Hartzell had successfully reduced the initial sum claimed by [CTL], and had not simply accepted the original claim \u2026</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Further, she noted that opportunities to participate in the settlement negotiations had been given to the appellant in so far as the respondent had made conscious efforts to contact the appellant seeking contribution, but the appellant had \u201cfailed to respond\u201d to its letters: GD at [50]. A significant factor that impressed the assistant registrar was the length of the negotiations, which lasted some nine months. The length of this period, she pithily observed (GD at [52]), was:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[F]ar from suggestive that the final sum of US$300,000 and the EMC Global Summary were accepted by the [respondent] hastily without due consideration of the merits of [CTL\u2019s] case. Moreover, Matthew Hartzell stated that he had questioned various aspects of the EMC Global Summary, such as \u201cwhy it cost so much money\u201d and \u201cwhy rectification and purging had to be done so quickly\u201d.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">More importantly, we noted that the assistant registrar took into account evidence which demonstrated the <i>bona fide</i> nature of the settlement. She summarised her findings of fact thus (GD at [54] and [57]):</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 Although Kimberly Aube conceded that certain pages of the EMC Global Summary were submitted by EMC, she clearly considered the entire document to be her own report, albeit prepared with the assistance of EMC. While she stated that certain pages were prepared \u201c100% based on EMC\u2019s input\u201d, she had also testified that she had verified the figures by looking at the corresponding receipts, bills and orders. Kimberly Aube had also incorporated information contained in this document into her own affidavit of evidence-in-chief. <i>When questioned about various parts of the document during cross-examination, she displayed intimate knowledge of all the details of the document. Furthermore, she had personally supervised the entire purging process in Franklin as well as Cork, as well as monitored the operating time, costs and expenses. I find therefore that there is no hearsay as Kimberly Aube had personal knowledge of the details of EMC\u2019s costs. On the contrary, I was impressed by Kimberly Aube\u2019s methodical and meticulous manner of tracing the steps of the entire purging process, as well as documenting all the costs incurred. It can hardly be concluded that it was unreasonable for the [respondent] to have accepted the costs claimed in this document.</i></font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">\u2026</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In sum, I find that the settlement was a reasonable one. There was proper legal advice given by the [respondent\u2019s] own legal counsel, who had properly taken into account the possibility of incurring exorbitant costs in the event that litigation took place. [CTL] had properly supervised every step of the purging process and was aware of the costs incurred. Matthew Hartzell, on behalf of the [respondent], had also asked for support of the claim. The [respondent] had spent substantial time attempting to reduce the sum claimed by [CTL]. The quantum that was settled for was more than reasonable, since [CTL\u2019s] own costs in purging were finally excluded and only EMC\u2019s costs were claimed. There was also a quid pro quo, as [CTL] was given permission to audit the [respondent\u2019s] work processes in the future. <em>As explained by Kimberly Aube, the large sum for purging was due to the urgency in rectifying the [printed circuit boards]. There were only two weeks for all the products to be repaired and tested to meet EMC\u2019s demands to its customers. On all counts, this was, in my opinion, a reasonable settlement.</em></font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[emphasis added]</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant appealed against the assistant registrar\u2019s decision. The resulting registrar\u2019s appeal was heard by a judge, and his decision is reported in <span class=\"title1\"><i>Smith &amp; Associates Far East Ltd v Britestone Pte Ltd</i><nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 958</nobr>.</span> The appellant, in the course of that appeal, did not dispute its liability for US$2,184, being the respondent\u2019s loss of profit (see [11] above). The sole issue for determination by the judge was whether the appellant had to pay the respondent the US$300,000 that the respondent had paid in full and final settlement of CTL\u2019s claim against it. The judge dismissed the appeal. He held that the damages were plainly within the parties\u2019 contemplation and were not too remote.

In the present case, Smith and Britestone had traded with each other for a long time and Britestone\u2019s sales manager, Ms\u00a0Tan, accepted during cross-examination that when Smith ordered the capacitors, it was stated that the capacitors were for its customers.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">\u2026</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, the capacitors sold by Britestone to Smith became an \u201cintegral\u201d part of the printed circuit boards in the same way the vinyl film in <i>Bence Graphics</i> [see [18] <i>infra</i>] became an integral part of the decals. The fact that it was CTL and not Smith who fixed the capacitors onto the printed circuit boards should not matter in the circumstances of the case, <i>and especially so since the testimony of Smith\u2019s Mr\u00a0Prymmer that the capacitors sold by Britestone to Smith had no use other than to be installed onto printed circuit boards was not contradicted by Britestone</i>.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[emphasis in original]</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the judge held that the settlement sum was reasonable and properly arrived at in the light of the legal advice provided by Hartzell and the length of the negotiations between CTL and the respondent.

I have seen this type of claim both inside and outside private legal practice and legal practice as general counsel of Smith &amp; Associations. In my experience, unless you settle a case where you have a claim of $400,000, you are never going to see a lower number from that claimant. I know from this case, from document[s] I reviewed and discussions with CTL, that we were talking about costs, their lost profits, any time delays, any damage to reputation they might have from their customer and so forth. We did not even know at that time whether the entire problem had been solved. They hurried to get to [<i>sic</i>] customer to fix [the] problem.

Before us, the same two legal issues that were raised before the judge were once again canvassed. To reiterate, the first issue was whether the damages claimed by the respondent were too remote (\u201cthe remoteness issue\u201d), and the second issue entailed a consideration of whether the settlement reached between the respondent and CTL was reasonable and could be relied on as reflecting the actual loss suffered by the respondent (\u201cthe reasonableness issue\u201d). We now consider these issues in turn.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The remoteness issue</font></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The applicable law</font></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The law in this area is relatively uncontroversial. The appellant\u2019s position was that the damages claimed were not within its reasonable contemplation. At the hearing before us, the appellant\u2019s counsel, Mr\u00a0Sham Chee Keat (\u201cMr\u00a0Sham\u201d), submitted that the fact that the capacitors would only be employed on printed circuit boards was not disclosed to the appellant and, hence, the damages claimed were too remote. This was, with respect, a far too simplistic approach. In view of the unchallenged evidence that the capacitors could not be used as stand-alone items but only on printed circuit boards, the rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i> (1893) 6\u00a0R 67 <i>prima facie</i> applied. This rule stands for the well-settled proposition that (<i>per</i> Colin Tapper, <i>Cross and Tapper on Evidence</i> (Butterworths, 8th\u00a0Ed, 1995) at p\u00a0319, which was cited in <i>Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 111</nobr> at [48]; see also M\u00a0N\u00a0Howard <i>et al,</i> <i>Phipson on Evidence</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th\u00a0Ed, 1990) at para\u00a012-13):</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Any matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief ...</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">In the course of the proceedings before the assistant registrar, Mr\u00a0Sham did not take issue at all with the respondent\u2019s unequivocal evidence on this issue. In such circumstances, it was not open to the appellant to challenge on appeal, either before the judge or us, the fact that the capacitors could not be used as stand-alone items but only on printed circuit boards.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following from his failure to convince us that the factual finding mentioned in the preceding paragraph could be challenged, Mr Sham then argued that the appellant was not aware of the respondent\u2019s intention to use the capacitors in the particular manner in which they had actually been used. In this connection, Mr\u00a0Sham attempted to distinguish the present case (wrongly, in our view) from <i>Bence Graphics International Ltd v Fasson UK Ltd</i> [1998] QB 87 (\u201c<i>Bence Graphics</i>\u201d) by arguing that in that case, the defendant knew of the plaintiff\u2019s intention to use the products in a particular manner, while, in this case, the appellant was unaware of any such intention. In <i>Bence Graphics</i>, which involved the purchase of vinyl film, the seller knew that the buyer intended to make the vinyl film into identification decalcomania (\u201cdecal\u201d) for sale to container owners, who would in turn sell containers marked with the decals to shipping lines and other users. It was a condition of the contract of sale that the film should be able to survive for use in good legible condition for at least five years, and the defendant warranted its quality. The film was defective and some decals became illegible. Otton\u00a0LJ in <i>Bence Graphics</i> approved the <i>dicta</i> of Devlin\u00a0J (as he then was) in <i>Biggin &amp; Co Ld v Permanite Ld</i> [1951] 1\u00a0KB 422 (\u201c<i>Biggin &amp; Co (HC)</i>\u201d) at 436, where Devlin\u00a0J held that \u201c[i]f \u2026 a subsale is within the contemplation of the parties, I think that the damages must be assessed by reference to it, whether the plaintiff likes it or not\u201d. For the reasons to follow (see [21]\u2013[23] below), the facts of <i>Bence Graphics</i> could not be distinguished from those in the present case. Bearing in mind the fact that the capacitors could only be used on printed circuit boards, it must surely have been within the appellant\u2019s reasonable contemplation that the capacitors would be used in such a manner by the respondent.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding this preliminary conclusion, it will be helpful to briefly summarise at this point the salient facts of <i>Biggin &amp; Co (HC)</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>), since the case will feature prominently in our later discussion on the reasonableness issue and is also of relevance to the present remoteness issue. In <i>Biggin &amp; Co (HC)</i>, the plaintiff, Biggin &amp; Co Ltd, bought defective goods from the defendant, Permanite Ltd. The plaintiff sold the goods to the Dutch government. Subsequently, the Dutch government alleged that it had suffered damage as a result of the resale. The plaintiff agreed to pay the Dutch government an amount in settlement of the claim brought by the latter against it. The plaintiff, in turn, sought to recover from the defendant the amount which it had paid the Dutch government as settlement. At first instance, Devlin\u00a0J held that the damages which the plaintiff sought to recover were not too remote. He held (at 432):</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">I do not think that the application of the principle is to be determined by the number of links in the chain. If what happened at the end was within the contemplation of the parties, I do not think it matters how long the chain is.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">He added that the contracts along the chain connecting them must be the same and found (at 432) that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[I]n claims based upon sub-sales by the Dutch government, the description of the compound and any warranties of quality must be substantially the same in all the contracts in the chain. It is not disputed that the necessary similarity exists in the contracts between the defendants and the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs and the government respectively. \u2026 The second qualification is that claims arising after the government knew or ought to have known of the defects in the compound should be excluded. On this point I have already found the facts.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Devlin\u00a0J\u2019s decision was appealed against. Although the English Court of Appeal in <i>Biggin &amp; Co Ld v Permanite Ld</i> [1951] 2\u00a0KB 314 (\u201c<i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>\u201d) ultimately reversed the decision, only one finding was in fact reversed, <i>viz</i>, Devlin\u00a0J\u2019s conclusion at 430 that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[T]he plaintiffs cannot prove their damages by reference to the settlement which they made with the Dutch government and \u2026 evidence relating to such a settlement is irrelevant and inadmissible.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">This issue relating to the permissibility of relying on a reasonable settlement will be scrutinised in further detail shortly ([25]\u2013[41] below). The English Court of Appeal more recently in <i>Bence Graphics</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>) approved Devlin\u00a0J\u2019s <i>dicta</i> in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (HC)</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>) on the remoteness of damages. The pertinent portions of the headnote of <i>Bence Graphics</i> read:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[T]hat the prima facie measure of damages for breach of warranty of quality provided by section\u00a053(3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 would be displaced \u2026 [if it was] in the contemplation of the parties at the time the warranty was given that the goods sold would be used in making a product which would be sold on; that in such a case the measure of damages would be based not on the difference between the value of the goods as delivered and that warranted but on the buyer's liability to the subsequent or ultimate users of the product arising from the defects constituting a breach of the seller's warranty; \u2026 <i>since the defendants had been aware that the vinyl film would be used by the plaintiffs in making decals which would be sold on to customers requiring five-year durability, the parties must be taken as having contemplated that any latent defect in the film might on becoming apparent render the plaintiffs liable to claims for damages by subsequent or ultimate users and the measure of damages should therefore be based on any such liability of the plaintiffs</i> \u2026 [emphasis added]</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">We agree with this common-sense approach.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Application of the law to the facts</font></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Returning to the facts of the present case, it is significant that this was not the first time that the parties had transacted with each other. There had been previous dealings, and it was patently the case that the appellant had knowledge of the purpose of the capacitors. Mr\u00a0Sham argued that since Tan claimed that she did not know of the purpose for which the respondent were going to use the capacitors, the appellant had no knowledge that the capacitors would be used in conjunction with printed circuit boards. In our view, this was an unmeritorious argument. <i>Benjamin\u2019s Sale of Goods</i> (A\u00a0G\u00a0Guest gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th\u00a0Ed, 2006) correctly summarises the position on imputed knowledge at para\u00a016-045 thus:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Imputed knowledge.</font></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">\u2026</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Lord\u00a0Wright [in <i>Monarch Steamship Co Ltd v Karlshamns Oljefabriker (A/B)</i> [1949] AC\u00a0196 at 224] has said that the test for imputed knowledge is \u201cwhat reasonable business men must be taken to have contemplated as the natural and probable result if the contract was broken. As reasonable business men, each must be taken to understand the ordinary practices and exigencies of the other\u2019s trade or business.\u201d Thus, a buyer or seller of goods normally knows more about the other\u2019s business than the carrier of goods knows about the business of the consignor or the consignee, or than the seller of land knows about the intentions of the purchaser to use it in a particular way.

For example, in <i>Pinnock Brothers v Lewis and Peat, Limited</i> [1923] 1\u00a0KB 690, the buyers bought East African copra cake, which they resold to sub-buyers who manufactured the cake into feeding materials for cattle. The copra cake was later found to contain an admixture which made it poisonous for cattle. The court found (at 697) that \u201cit was within the contemplation of the parties that this copra cake should used \u2026 for cattle food <i>and nothing else</i>\u201d [emphasis added]. It was held that the buyers were entitled to recover from the original seller the damages which they had to pay to the sub-buyers.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant\u2019s submission that it was not aware or affixed with knowledge of the intended usage of the capacitors lacked both substance and logic. To countenance such an argument would be to disregard the obvious. For example, one cannot in good conscience say that one is buying or selling animal feed and yet claim to be oblivious to what it is used for. The same reasoning applies here. Surely, the appellant, having been in the electronics industry for many years and having had several similar sales transactions with the respondent, must have known that such capacitors are not stand-alone articles. On their own, the capacitors serve no function; they are component parts which are used in conjunction with electrical circuit boards. We accepted the respondent\u2019s submission that dealers in the electronic business would know the end-use of these capacitors, especially in this case where the parties had not just a long-standing relationship, but also extensive experience in the electronic parts industry. Therefore, we found that the damages were plainly within the appellant\u2019s reasonable contemplation and, hence, not too remote.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before we proceed to discuss the next point on whether the settlement sum was reasonable, it is apposite to reiterate that in the present case, liability was not in issue. The issue before us was not whether liability can be compromised through a settlement agreement, but, rather, whether a court should allow reliance on a reasonable settlement as satisfactorily evidencing actual loss when liability is not disputed, and, if so, how the reasonableness of the settlement is to be determined.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The reasonableness issue</font></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\"><em>The authority of</em> Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</font></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the reasonableness issue, the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) stood as a formidably unfavourable authority against the appellant. The English Court of Appeal in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>, it will be remembered, had reversed Devlin\u00a0J\u2019s decision on just one issue (see [20] above]. It disagreed with Devlin\u00a0J that the evidence of the settlement between the plaintiff and the Dutch government was irrelevant because the making of the settlement had been a voluntary act by the plaintiff. In this regard, the English Court of Appeal held at 325:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">If, upon the evidence, the judge is satisfied that the damages would be somewhere around the figure at which the plaintiffs had settled, he would be justified in awarding the settlement figure. \u2026 The plaintiffs must establish a prima facie case that the settlement was a reasonable one.

Mr\u00a0Sham argued that <i>Unity Insurance</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>) had criticised <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> for its failure to consider issues of causation and remoteness, and relied, in purported support of his stance, on certain observations of McHugh\u00a0J at [31] and [34]\u2013[35]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With great respect to the Court of Appeal, the reasoning is far from clear. First, it is not clear whether their Lordships even considered issues of causation and remoteness. Perhaps their Lordships assumed that the settlement was causally connected with the breach and that it was not too remote a consequence of that breach if the settlement was reasonable. But they did not say so. Moreover, the reference to public policy in the judgment of Somervell\u00a0LJ suggests that they did not consider the case in terms of causation or remoteness.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">\u00a0 \u2026</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<em>\u00a0 In my opinion, Biggin should not be used as an authority in this country.</em> \u2026</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">\u2026</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 Somervell\u00a0LJ expressed the opinion that, while the client can prove that the settlement was made as the result of legal advice, the evidence of the advisers is not ordinarily relevant or admissible.

That was a case where the insured (the respondent) sued an insurance broker (the appellant) for breach of contract in relation to an insurance policy arranged by the broker, the insurer (NZI Insurance Australia Ltd (\u201cNZI\u201d)) having refused to pay on the respondent\u2019s claim. The respondent had leased premises to sell fruit and vegetables. It had appointed the appellant as its insurance broker, and the appellant had arranged an industrial special risks policy for the respondent with NZI. One of the risks covered by the policy was damage to the respondent\u2019s premises and its plant, machinery, stock and contents by fire. The appellant negligently failed to fully disclose the respondent\u2019s claims history to NZI. Subsequently, the premises and its plant, machinery, stock and contents were damaged by fire. NZI refused to pay the full amount which would have been payable under the policy but for the non-disclosure. The respondent brought proceedings against the appellant and NZI, in which NZI paid the respondent a lesser sum of A$900,000 by way of compromise in full settlement of the claim. The respondent continued with its proceedings against the appellant and sought to claim the balance from the appellant. Hayne\u00a0J made these pertinent observations in relation to <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) at [127]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">It may be doubted whether the reasons for judgment are as unequivocal as the headnote suggests. Further, there is little discussion of the underlying principles. Other than a reference by Somervell\u00a0LJ to the law encouraging reasonable settlements, the reasons of the members of the Court do not identify why the settlement should be taken as the measure of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages, and do not discuss in any detail what is meant by \u201creasonable\u201d in this context. [footnotes omitted]</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Further, he stated at [135]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The Court of Appeal in <i>Biggin &amp; Co Ltd</i> held that it was relevant for the client that had compromised to give evidence that this step had been \u201cmade under advice legally taken\u201d, but Somervell\u00a0LJ went on to suggest that the advisers would not \u201cnormally\u201d be relevant as admissible witnesses. \u2026 I do not accept that the evidence of the advisers would be irrelevant or inadmissible. [footnotes omitted]</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A more careful and closer reading of <i>Unity Insurance</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>) does not, contrary to Mr\u00a0Sham\u2019s submissions, suggest that <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) has been wholly disavowed in Australia. Indeed, the headnote of <i>Unity Insurance</i> states that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[T]he insured\u2019s damages should be calculated according to the difference between what it would have recovered under the policy [which] the broker ought to have arranged and the amount [which] it recovered under the settlement, as long as the settlement was reasonable when judged objectively by reference to the circumstances at the time, including the reasoning supporting the advice upon which the insured acted in accepting it.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">This appears broadly consistent with the main holding of <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> <i>apropos</i> the importance of the objective reasonableness of a settlement. We interpose here to mention that <i>Unity Insurance</i> has also recently been applied in the 2001 Supreme Court of Queensland decision of <i>C\u00a0A &amp; M\u00a0E\u00a0C Mcinally Nominees Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd</i> (2001) 188\u00a0ALR 439, where Chesterman\u00a0J held at [65]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">It is clear from the judgment in the High Court [in <i>Unity Insurance</i>] that an insured seeking damages from an insurer for breach of its promise to grant indemnity must prove what loss it has suffered by reason of the breach. The loss claimed by the insured must have been caused by the breach and must not be too remote from it in the sense that it must have been reasonably foreseeable and/or within the reasonable contemplation of the parties to the contract when they made it. <i>In some cases proof of such loss will be established by the insured having made a reasonable compromise, but in other cases that will not suffice for the purpose. That case itself illustrates the difficulty of determining the circumstances in which a settlement will be sufficient proof</i>. [emphasis added]</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Granted that <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) may have been criticised by some members of the court in <i>Unity Insurance</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>) for its bare reasoning (and a fair criticism this may well be), this does not detract from the key holding in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> that a settlement can be relied on as against a responsible party if it is reasonable and thereby reasonably reflects actual loss. We noted the appellant\u2019s mantra that the respondent was obliged to prove all the elements of its settlement amount all over again, but that is not, in the final analysis, what the decision of the majority in <i>Unity Insurance</i> either stands for or illustrates. <i>Unity Insurance</i> broadly held that in assessing whether a settlement could be relied on to prove a claim for loss, the court had first to be satisfied that the terms of the settlement were reasonable, and that this acid test comprised an amalgam of considerations. This includes the existence of legal advice and the prospects of success if the dispute had actually been litigated based on the materials available at the time of the settlement. In this regard, the decision of <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> can be said to have been generally endorsed by the majority (Brennan\u00a0CJ, McHugh and Hayne\u00a0JJ) in <i>Unity Insurance</i>. To borrow the words of Brennan\u00a0CJ in <i>Unity Insurance</i> at [6]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The plaintiff must show that the sum accepted in settlement was reasonable [<i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> at 321, <i>per</i> Somervell\u00a0LJ; at 326, <i>per</i> Singleton\u00a0LJ]. The test of reasonableness is, as Hayne\u00a0J says, an objective one. Evidence of the advice which the insured received to induce it to accept the settlement is not proof in itself of the reasonableness of the settlement advised. The factors which lead to the giving of the advice are factors relevant to the reasonableness of the settlement but the only relevance of advice given by the insured\u2019s legal advisers to settle is that it tends to negative the hypothesis that the insured acted unreasonably in accepting the settlement.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the Australian High Court in <i>Unity Insurance</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>) had rightly expressed its reservations about certain aspects of the English Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>), in that the latter did not adequately address the principles of causation and treated the issue of remoteness as not relevant. The English Court of Appeal simply assumed the satisfaction of the requisite element of causation and the absence of remoteness. However, the majority in <i>Unity Insurance</i> did not depart from the approach articulated in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> that before a settlement could be relied on, it had to be reasonable, and a factor evidencing reasonableness was that the settlement had been made pursuant to legal advice. It is this point that is relevant to us in relation to the reasonableness issue, and we find that there is no difference in essence between the broad common-sense approach towards recognising settlements adopted in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> and that adopted in <i>Unity Insurance</i>. Singleton and Birkett\u00a0LJJ in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> were of the view that the fact that a settlement had been made under legal advice was relevant in determining its reasonableness. With regard to Somervell\u00a0LJ\u2019s comments at 321 that the evidence of advisers would not \u201cnormally be relevant\u201d, it should be noted that Somervell\u00a0LJ went on to add that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[I]f there is evidence \u2026 on which the court can come to the conclusion that this was a reasonable settlement in the circumstances, then ... it should be the measure.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">It is our view that Somervell\u00a0LJ, by the above comments, was merely emphasising the importance of the plaintiff leading evidence to prove that the settlement sum was reasonable.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, this court\u2019s previous observations in <i>Brown Noel Trading</i> ([25] <i>supra</i>) buttress our view that there is no conflict between the two jurisdictions on the relevance of the reasonableness of settlements in determining whether such settlements can be treated as evidencing the actual loss suffered. In <i>Brown Noel Trading</i>, the plaintiffs and the defendants entered into a contract whereby the defendants were to sell steel reinforcing bars to the plaintiffs. The defendants contracted to purchase the same from a third party, with the third party to deliver the goods by a certain date and the defendants to open a letter of credit in favour of the third party prior to that. The defendants opened and delivered the letter of credit to the third party late. Subsequently, the third party informed the defendants that it had problems supplying the goods and offered alternative specifications which the plaintiffs refused to accept. The plaintiffs then commenced an action against the defendants claiming damages for breach of contract, and the defendants in turn commenced third party proceedings against the third party. The plaintiffs and the defendants arrived at a settlement. The third party proceedings carried on. In dealing with the third party proceedings, this court, applying the reasoning in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>), concluded (at [67]) that the settlement arrived at was reasonable and thus allowed a claim by the defendants against the third party for the settlement amount:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">In reaching the settlement the defendants were advised by their solicitors and there was nothing to suggest that their solicitors\u2019 advice was patently wrong or that there was anything suspicious. In all the circumstances, the settlement arrived at was reasonable, and the amount the defendants had paid to [the plaintiffs] should have been allowed.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Further, this court held at [70]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">In the Australian case of <i>Wong v Hutchison</i> [(1950)] 68\u00a0WN (NSW) 55 a trader who failed to deliver goods to his buyer was held liable to the buyer for damages which the latter settled with the sub-buyer. Owen\u00a0J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales held [that] the settlement reached in that case was prima facie reasonable. He said, at p\u00a058:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Apart however from these considerations, it seems to me that where a trader fails to deliver goods and thereby commits a breach of contract to which he has no apparent answer and thereafter proceeds to settle a claim for damages for that breach by making payment of an amount which, on the face of it, does not appear to be exorbitant having regard to the value of the goods which he has undertaken to deliver and the difficulties of replacing them, such a settlement should prima facie be regarded as reasonable, since as a matter of common sense it is surely the exception rather than the rule for a commercial man to settle a claim made against him by paying an extravagant or unreasonable amount because he has a remedy \u2026 against a third party who may or may not be worth and [<i>sic</i>] shot. <i>In the absence of anything to raise a suspicion to the contrary, I think it is a fair presumption that a business man who settles a business claim made against him has acted reasonably in doing so</i>.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[emphasis added]</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">We do, however, have some reservations in relation to this court\u2019s earlier unqualified adoption of the suggestion (as set out in the above passage) that there is an evidential presumption that business settlements are made reasonably. In our view, the <i>fact</i> that a settlement has been effected or adopted between businessmen adds nothing to the requirement that the party seeking to rely on such a settlement must show that it is reasonable. Settlements can be made for a number of reasons, not all of which are objectively reasonable. Settlements are sometimes made to preserve business relationships regardless of the legal merits and/or reasonableness of a claim. It is noteworthy that the decision by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in <i>Wong v Hutchison</i> (1950) 68\u00a0WN (NSW) 55, which this court in <i>Brown Noel Trading</i> relied on for this proposition, pre-dates the decision in <i>Unity Insurance</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>). Having provided a broad overview of the applicable law and the standing authority of <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>, it is perhaps now appropriate to examine the approaches taken by the other common law jurisdictions in greater detail. By undertaking such a comparative approach, we intend to distil certain common guiding principles which can then be applied in the Singapore context.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Approaches in other common law jurisdictions</font></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The English approach</font></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It appears that the approach in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) remains good law in England. Footnote\u00a02 to para\u00a045 of <i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England,</i> vol\u00a04(3) (Butterworths, 4th\u00a0Ed Reissue, 2002) reads:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">If the main contractor compromises the employer\u2019s claim arising from the sub-contractor\u2019s breach, the amount paid in settlement is admissible prima facie evidence of the amount of loss and damage caused by the sub-contractor, although liability would still need to be established: see eg [<i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>].</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we have mentioned (at [30] above), <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) stands, <i>inter alia</i>, for the proposition that in determining whether a settlement is reasonable such that it can be relied upon to evidence the actual loss suffered, the courts should have regard to the fact that most settlement agreements are entered into on the basis of responsible legal advice. In addition, it is not the function of the court to dissect the elements of a settlement if it comes to the conclusion that the settlement is, in the round, reasonable. The recent Queen\u2019s Bench Division (Commercial Court) case of <i>BP\u00a0plc v Aon Ltd</i>[2006] 1\u00a0All ER (Comm) 789 is illustrative of this pragmatic approach sired by <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>. In that case, <span lang=\"EN\">Aon Ltd(\u201cAon\u201d) was appointed by the Amoco group (\u201cAmoco\u201d) as its insurance broker to devise and place a global construction all risks open cover facility (\u201copen cover\u201d) to insure Amoco\u2019s offshore construction projects worldwide. In order to obtain cover in respect of any project, that project had to be expressly declared under the open cover. Amoco merged with BP\u00a0plc (\u201cBP\u201d). The open cover that was then placed by Aon was a standing offer of insurance that ran for 18\u00a0months between 1\u00a0January 1998 and 1\u00a0July 2000. As is usual with open covers in the energy sector, subject to the projects notified being embraced by the terms of the cover, the projects declared would be binding on the insurers. During the life of the open cover, the market (in which rates for open covers had previously been relatively soft) turned and BP made as many declarations of eligible projects as possible towards the end of the cover period as it could then make considerable savings on the premiums payable. As a result, there was a rush of purported declarations shortly before the expiry of the open cover. Some of the underwriters objected to the cascade of last-minute declarations. BP entered into a settlement agreement with two lead insurers who agreed to accept a number of declarations on certain terms. Although Aon (the insurance broker) persuaded some of the insurers to enter into the settlement agreement, it was unable to persuade a considerable proportion of the insurers (\u201cthe defendants\u201d) to do so. BP commenced proceedings against the defendants. These proceedings were later compromised when BP entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants. Subsequently, BP commenced proceedings against Aon based on the latter\u2019s failure to declare projects to each of the defendants within the period of the open cover. BP\u2019s claim was for the shortfall in recovery from the defendants in its earlier action against the latter as well as the costs of that action. One of the defences raised by Aon was in relation to the global settlement which BP had reached. In particular, it was argued that BP had not negotiated vigorously enough with some of the insurers and had, therefore, compromised its rights for too little.</span> In determining the question of <span class=\"documentbody1\">whether, in all the circumstances, the settlement was reasonable</span>, the court adopted the reasoning in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> and held at [282]\u2013[283]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span class=\"documentbody1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">282\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this connection, the fact that the terms of a settlement were entered into upon legal advice establishes, at least, that those terms were prima facie reasonable. It is then for the defendant to displace that inference by evidence to the contrary, by establishing, for example, that some vital matter was overlooked (see [<i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>] at 321 per Somervell\u00a0LJ). However, the evaluation of the reasonableness of a settlement should not involve the court in arriving at a conclusive judgment on the merits of substantial issues which were contentious in the settled litigation. The court does not need to resolve those issues unless the answer is beyond doubt. The reason for this is that it is testing the reasonableness of the settlement by reference to the perception as to success or failure which the parties would have been expected to hold at the time when the settlement was entered into and the issues remained unresolved: see generally <i>Mander v Commercial Union Assurance Co plc</i> \u2026 [1998] Lloyd's Rep IR 93 at 148\u2013149.</font></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span class=\"documentbody1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">283\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further, as Mr\u00a0Popplewell submitted on behalf of BP, it is only necessary for a claimant to establish that the settlement arrived at was at a figure within the range of what would have been reasonable. This may be quite a wide range because the views of experienced commercial lawyers and businessmen as to the particular strength of their party's case relative to the strength of the opposing party's case can differ quite widely. <i>The test is therefore whether the settlement arrived at was, in all the circumstances which the settling party knew or ought reasonably to have known at the time of the settlement, within the range of settlements which reasonable commercial men might have made. To the extent that such settlement was excessive, the settling party cannot recover. However the range would have to be defined by reference to the benefits and detriments of any settlement for all parties to it</i>.</font></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span class=\"documentbody1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[emphasis added]</font></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We find it helpful, at this juncture, to also set out here for comparative purposes the rather similar observations made out by Hayne\u00a0J in <i>Unity Insurance</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>) at [132]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">What is a reasonable compromise of the claim will almost always require consideration of the chances of the parties succeeding in their respective claims or defences and that prediction of likely outcomes must always be imperfect and imprecise. <i>To state the obvious, that is why the compromise of a claim, which is a monetary claim that will succeed entirely or fail entirely, will usually fasten upon a figure that is less than [what] would be recovered if the claim were to succeed and why it is that there will be a range of figures within which the reasonable observer may conclude that settlement of the claim would be reasonable</i>.

The broad principle at play is that the claimant must prove its actual loss and, to this extent, the courts adopt the pragmatic approach that if the settlement is reasonably reached and reasonable in nature, the amount agreed therein will be regarded as accurately reflecting the actual loss suffered by the downstream claimant. Indeed, the criterion of \u201creasonableness\u201d permeates the judicial inquiry as to whether a settlement agreement can be relied upon against an upstream defendant as accurately reflecting the actual losses suffered by a downstream claimant, and the predominant factor taken into account by the courts in assessing reasonableness appears to be whether legal advice was undertaken. As the present case involves the recovery of a prior settlement made with a third party, we think that it would be helpful to clarify the circumstances in which the courts ought to acknowledge such settlements, namely, when liability is not or is no longer an issue between the parties before the court. To recapitulate, liability was not an issue before us (see [24] above).</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Relevant considerations to be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of settlements</font></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">General overview</font></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to the relevant considerations to be taken into account in ascertaining the reasonableness of settlements, Lord\u00a0Eassie in <i>E\u00a0&amp;\u00a0J Glasgow Limited v UGC Estates Limited</i> <nobr>[2005] CSOH 63</nobr> (\u201c<i>E\u00a0&amp;\u00a0J Glasgow Limited</i>\u201d) made the following incisive observations (at [55]) which we found helpful:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">In my view, there are plainly a variety of methods whereby a settlement of a third party claim may come about, these ranging through <i>a spectrum extending from a direct negotiation or discussion between principals in meetings of greater or less formality to negotiation through lawyers or other agents to ultimate judicial determination at final appellate level</i>. Mr\u00a0Cormack, for the defenders, whose submissions were unreservedly adopted by Mr\u00a0Connal, recognised arbitration as one such method within the spectrum. In the event of litigation, judicial reference to a \u201cman of skill\u201d ie an expert, might be appropriate. There is, of course, increasing recognition of the role of alternative dispute resolution procedures in the settlement of commercial affairs. Accordingly I do not consider that \u2013 at least at this stage \u2013 I can accept the proposition that it was not <i>foreseeable that in advance of the raising of this litigation the pursuers and Kier might confide the settlement of the claims arising between them to a binding expert determination</i>.

[<i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>] provides two answers to that question. (a) A rule of evidence. The Court of Appeal in that case stressed that it is the policy of the court to encourage settlements. For that reason, there may be a readiness to accept that individuals settling a claim between them may be taken to have as their purpose trying to reach a settlement at a fair figure related to the claim. \u2026 But in many cases, it is inherently unlikely that businessmen, particularly those acting on competent advice, would settle a third party\u2019s claim at a figure significantly in excess of its true value. As Singleton\u00a0LJ said in [<i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>] at 325, \u2018No one can think that a person or a company will agree to pay \u00a343,000 damages lightly\u2019, but I would add that the reason for the paying party agreeing to make the payment has to be examined. So if a third party\u2019s claim is settled, proof of the settlement may be some evidence of its true value, though not conclusive. The settlement sets a maximum to the claim, and depending on the weight to be attached to it as evidence, it may reduce the degree and detail of evidence required to prove the claim in the action.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second rule in <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> (1854) 9\u00a0Exch 341, [1843-60] All ER Rep 461.

The application of both aspects of that authority, the evidentiary rule and the <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> approach must be fashioned to the facts of the individual case.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We accept that businessmen who are equipped with and rendered \u201ccompetent advice\u201d (<i>per</i> Judge\u00a0Bowsher\u00a0QC in <i>P\u00a0&amp;\u00a0O Developments Ltd</i> ([37] <i>supra</i>) at [38]) will, in all probability, not settle a third party\u2019s claim at a figure which is higher than the true value of the damage. This is a common-sense approach acknowledging that, in the usual course of commercial dealings, parties prefer to resolve rather than litigate differences. Indeed, such an approach is also utilised by the various jurisdictions which we have examined above. However, this approach is not to be elevated into an evidential presumption or inexorable rule of practice. Each settlement must be assessed on its own merits to ascertain if it is reasonable and, therefore, can <i>prima facie</i> be relied on: see [31] above.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the parties settle a dispute without giving notice to the third party or the ultimate payee, the courts are more likely to investigate and dissect the settlement terms and process, and will be slower to acknowledge the settlement. However, as in the case here, even if notice has been given to the ultimate payee, who does not raise any objection but merely buries its head in the ground like an ostrich, the courts will nevertheless still have to scrutinise the settlement terms while taking into account the fact that the ultimate payee had earlier declined an opportunity to participate in the process. There is no issue of estoppel or implied acquiescence that can be said to apply to such a situation. The ultimate payee remains free to complain, but the courts may be more inclined to view its complaints with less sympathy, given the fact that it had been provided with an opportunity to voice its objections and give its input, to which it elected to pay no heed.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the determination of the reasonableness of the settlement reached in any particular claim may seem more like an art than a science, having a conceptual framework to evaluate the various factors may assist parties to approach the often elusive touchstone of \u201creasonableness\u201d.

This does not go to the central question of whether a settlement is reasonable, but operates peripherally to enable that question to be properly answered. Where the particulars of the process surrounding the arrival of the settlement are sparse, the courts would be less deposed to find that the settlement was in fact reasonable. This has more to do with the lack of proof that the settlement was in fact reasonable than with any substantive shortcomings of the settlement itself. As Lord\u00a0Eassie stated in <i>E\u00a0&amp;\u00a0J Glasgow Limited</i> ([42] <i>supra</i>) at [57]:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[I]t is difficult to see what further useful specification of factual matters could be provided as respects this first complaint of lack of specification.

The onus was on the plaintiff to do this if it was to seek to recover this sum from the defendants: see [<i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>]. <i>It is not sufficient for the plaintiff merely to plead the compromise without any explanation as to how the figure was made up or arrived at or any evidence as to how or why or on what advice it was entered into</i>.

The approach taken by the courts in so determining can be broadly characterised as the \u201creasonable businessman test\u201d. In <i>Holland Hannen &amp; Cubitts (Northern) Ltd v Welsh Health Technical Services Organisation</i> (1985) 35\u00a0BLR 1, the English Court of Appeal emphasised (<i>per</i> Lawton\u00a0LJ at 15) that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">There was no evidence that, when making the compromise, [the] parties to it took into consideration any extraneous matters such as lack of insurance cover or liquidity problems. <i>All acted in a businesslike way</i> and those who decided to compromise, in my judgment, <i>acted as reasonable businessmen would have done</i>; but <i>when considering the relevance of the compromise to the assessment of the damages</i> which AMP would have to pay CED if adjudged negligent, <i>the court has to consider</i> not the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties but the <i>reasonableness of the compromise</i> itself: see [<i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i>]. [emphasis added]</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">There must be some logical basis for arriving at the settlement sum, which cannot be simply plucked out of thin air. In the final analysis, as stated above, all the sub-factors showing such logical basis (which will be discussed in greater detail below at [50]\u2013[54]) can be encapsulated in an overriding test which is based on the viewpoint of the \u201creasonable businessman\u201d. In other words, the pertinent question which the courts must answer is this: <i>What would a reasonable businessman have done in the circumstances of the case?</i></font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To our minds, \u201creasonableness\u201d can, in this context, be assessed by a few objective factors. First, it must have been reasonable, in the context of the case, for the downstream claimant to settle the claim brought against it. Second, the downstream claimant must have acted reasonably in obtaining advice from an expert (which can include legal counsel). We must add, however, that the taking of external advice is only a signpost and not a requirement to evidence reasonableness. Third, the methodology underpinning the assessment of damages must itself be objectively ascertainable and reasonable. Ultimately, a reasonable businessman would, first and foremost, strive to act with determination to protect his own business interests. Such a person would not attempt to settle for a sum which is in excess of his legal liability or the true value of the damage caused. There is a real need to be wary of excessive settlement amounts that may sometimes be hastily reached to preserve business relationships. Such settlements should not be imposed on third parties as they will not pass muster as being objectively reasonable. As such, the courts have to take into account the business matrix and the negotiating position of the parties in order to ascertain that the settlement figure was not excessive or, put another way, beyond the parameters that reasonable businessmen would have agreed upon. By pegging the test at the level of the \u201creasonable businessman\u201d, the issue of settlement figures being too high, or even too low, can, in most instances, be satisfactorily resolved. It also bears mention that the touchstone of <i>reasonableness</i> is often employed by the law in assessing whether claims are generally recoverable. For example, Harvey McGregor, <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th\u00a0Ed, 2003) at para\u00a02-030 states:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Many types of expenses may be incurred by the claimant as a result of the breach which will constitute a recoverable loss. <i>Reasonable</i> expenditure by the claimant in inquiring and searching for goods, the delivery of which has been delayed by the defendant carrier, has been allowed; the same would apply in the case of goods lost by a carrier, or where their non-delivery or delayed delivery is under a contract of sale.

First, Hayne\u00a0J held at [129] that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[The settlement] must be judged objectively, not subjectively. Thus whether a party to litigation has received advice to settle may be important in deciding whether that person\u2019s conduct in settling the case was reasonable but, standing alone, the fact that a litigant was advised to settle at a particular figure reveals little or nothing about whether the settlement reached was reasonable.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Second, Hayne\u00a0J stated at [130] that:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[T]he settlement \u2026 must be judged by reference to the material the parties had available to them at the time the compromise was reached. It is not to be judged according to whether material which was obtained later shows that the opposite party could or could not have prosecuted or defended the claim successfully but according to the assessment which could properly be made at the time of settlement of the chances of success or failure.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Essentially, the plaintiff must show that he has assessed the settlement figure as any reasonable litigant would, and he has to further satisfy the court that he has properly evaluated and tested the underlying evidence supporting the settlement amount. To merely show that legal advice was taken in making the settlement may not <i>per se</i> aid the plaintiff\u2019s cause in proving that the settlement was reasonable. The settlement <i>process</i> is of crucial importance.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><sub><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">COMPETENT ADVICE</font></sub></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In connection with the earlier discussion about the relevance of legal advice, it bears mention that reliance on \u201ccompetent advice\u201d, be it from a legal, industry or other appropriate expert, goes towards showing that the claimant behaved reasonably in arriving at a just settlement. It is noteworthy that, in our view, competent advice need not encompass a legal quotient. We recognise that in certain specialised fields, the best specialist to provide appropriate advice may well be the industry expert himself. We find support for this view from Lord\u00a0Eassie\u2019s decision in <i>E\u00a0&amp;\u00a0J Glasgow Limited</i> ([42] <i>supra</i>) at [55], where he used the terms \u201cnegotiation through lawyers or other agents\u201d and \u201cjudicial reference to a \u2018man of skill\u2019 ie, an expert\u201d. This is a timely juncture to emphasise that there is often a very real distinction between the disparate considerations of whether the claimant acted reasonably in arriving at a settlement and whether the settlement itself was reasonable. Singleton\u00a0LJ in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) correctly noted (at 326) that \u201c[t]he question is not whether the plaintiffs acted reasonably in settling the claim, but whether the settlement was a reasonable one\u201d. However, we note that Judge\u00a0Bowsher\u00a0QC in <i>P\u00a0&amp;\u00a0O Developments Ltd</i> ([37] <i>supra</i>) at [43] adopted a different view:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[A]dvice received by the plaintiffs might go either to the question whether the plaintiffs acted reasonably or to the question whether the settlement was reasonable, or both. Moreover, whether the plaintiffs acted reasonably may have an evidential bearing on whether the settlement was reasonable.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Judge\u00a0Bowsher\u00a0QC\u2019s approach, is in our view, consistent with the \u201creasonable businessman test\u201d. We have earlier acknowledged (at [41] above) our acceptance as correct the principle that a reliable settlement has to be reasonable, and a factor evidencing reasonableness is that the settlement was made pursuant to legal advice. In short, the availability of competent advice, legal or otherwise, is a factor which the courts will consider in determining whether the parties acted reasonably, and this in turn goes towards showing whether the settlement itself is reasonable. We emphasise that reliance on legal advice is not necessarily or invariably a decisive consideration in the crucible of reasonableness. This must be a question of fact assessed in the totality of the factual matrix.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Summary of relevant considerations</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It will be helpful to summarise the relevant factors to be employed in assessing whether a settlement would pass muster as being reasonable. When a downstream claimant seeks to subsequently rely on an earlier settlement as reflecting the actual loss which he now claims against an upstream defendant, the courts should usually consider the following matters in determining whether he has acted as a responsible and reasonable businessman in arriving at the settlement:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the duration or period of negotiations as well as their general content;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether there are any customs of trade or previous business dealings between the parties and/or whether there are any legitimate business considerations or contractual requirements (<i>eg</i>, dispute resolution clauses, <i>etc</i>) enjoining a settlement ;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the negotiations were conducted <i>bona fide</i>;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the assessment which could properly be made at the time of settlement of the prospects of success or failure of the claim based on materials then available;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the availability of and/or reliance on legal advice, expert advice or independent survey reports taking into account considerations of cost and time;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the actual settlement itself was arrived at arm\u2019s length;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether there was an opportunity accorded to the third party/ultimate payee to be involved in the negotiations;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether there was a positive reception of complaints by the third party/ultimate payee;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the settlement amount has been paid, and, if so, how and when;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(j) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the bargaining strengths of the parties involved in the settlement, taking into account (among other things) alternative means by which the dispute could have been concluded;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(k)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether, in the round, the settlement figure was objectively assessed and properly calibrated against the context of the entire factual matrix; and</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(l)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the practical consequences of the decision on reasonableness.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The courts will assess these factors in a holistic fashion. We must emphasise that these factors are neither exhaustive nor to be viewed as anything more than a rough-and-ready practical guide. The broad policy of the law is to encourage settlements without insisting on technical and arid assessment of each item of evidence. The strict proof of evidence on a line-item basis can often be dispensed with, particularly where the costs involved would be disproportionate to the need for veracity. On the other side of the coin, it should also be pointed out that an \u201cunreasonable\u201d settlement may undermine any evidential foundation to prosecute a claim, and yet nevertheless set a ceiling for any later pursuit of the same claim. Further, if it can be shown that the settlement of a claim was wholly unreasonable, the upstream defendant can also plausibly assert that there has been a break in the chain of causation, thereby precluding the downstream party\u2019s claim in any form whatsoever. These are important considerations that businessmen and their advisers must bear in mind when they attempt to reach <i>ad hoc</i> settlements in a multiparty setting.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Application of the law to the facts</font></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having considered the applicable law, we now return to the facts of the present case. Mr\u00a0Sham vigorously contended that the settlement sum of US$300,000 was based on a single document that contained summarised information compiled by Aube, <i>viz</i>, the EMC report (see [7] above). He argued that the respondent had failed to make sufficient inquiries or produce other documents to substantiate the quantum claimed. Furthermore, there were no documents to justify the expenses involved in the purging exercise, which included personnel and travelling expenses. It was Mr\u00a0Sham\u2019s position that all of these supporting documents must be produced by the respondent; otherwise, the settlement was unreasonable. In our view, these submissions mask the deeper evidential principles at play.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Legal and evidential burden of proof</font></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, Mr\u00a0Sham\u2019s contentions on this point bring into sharp focus the crucial distinction between the legal and the evidential burden. When is it the responsibility of the plaintiff in a case to produce evidence to prove his case? Conversely, when is it the responsibility of the defendant to produce evidence to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s evidence? Mr\u00a0Sham seemingly contended for the position whereby the burden laid squarely and irreversibly with the plaintiff; while this is not entirely incorrect, it would be helpful to clarify the differences between the legal and the evidential burden.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The term \u201cburden of proof\u201d is more properly used with reference to the obligation to prove. There are in fact two kinds of burden in relation to the adduction of evidence. The first, designated the legal burden of proof, is, properly speaking, a burden of proof, for it describes the obligation to persuade the trier of fact that, in view of the evidence, the fact in dispute exists. This obligation never shifts in respect of any fact, and only \u201cshifts\u201d in a manner of loose terminology when a legal presumption operates. The second is a burden of proof only loosely speaking, for it falls short of an obligation to prove that a particular fact exists. It is more accurately designated the evidential burden to produce evidence since, whenever it operates, the failure to adduce some evidence, whether in propounding or rebutting, will mean a failure to engage the question of the existence of a particular fact or to keep this question alive. As such, this burden can and will shift.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court\u2019s decision in every case will depend on whether the party concerned has satisfied the particular burden and standard of proof imposed on him. Since the terms \u201cproved\u201d, \u201cdisproved\u201d and \u201cnot proved\u201d are statutory definitions contained in the Evidence Act (Cap\u00a097, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cEA\u201d), the term \u201cproof\u201d, wherever it appears in the EA and unless the context otherwise suggests, means the burden to satisfy the court of the existence or non-existence of some fact, that is, the legal burden of proof: see ss\u00a0103 and 105 of the EA. However, this is not to say that the evidential burden, which is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to raise an issue for the consideration of the trier of fact, does not exist. It exists as the tactical onus to contradict, weaken or explain away the evidence that has been led; there is no distinction between such tactical onus and the evidential burden.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To contextualise the above principles, at the start of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the legal burden of proving the existence of any relevant fact that the plaintiff must prove and the evidential burden of adducing some (not inherently incredible) evidence of the existence of such fact coincide. Upon adduction of that evidence, the evidential burden shifts to the defendant, as the case may be, to adduce some evidence in rebuttal. If no evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the court may conclude from the evidence of the plaintiff that the legal burden is also discharged and making a finding on the fact against the defendant. If, on the other hand, evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the evidential burden shifts back to the plaintiff. If, ultimately, the evidential burden comes to rest on the defendant, the legal burden of proof of that relevant fact would have been discharged by the plaintiff. The legal burden of proof \u2013 a permanent and enduring burden \u2013 does not shift. A party who has the legal burden of proof on any issue must discharge it throughout. Sometimes, the legal burden is spoken of, inaccurately, as \u201cshifting\u201d; but what is truly meant is that another issue has been engaged, on which the opposite party bears the legal burden of proof.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The burden of proof in this case</font></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the purposes of the present case, in showing that the settlement between the respondent and CTL was reasonable, we find it useful to borrow the words of Singleton\u00a0LJ in <i>Biggin</i> <i>&amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) at 325:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The plaintiffs must establish a prima facie case that the settlement was a reasonable one. If the defendants fail to shake that case, the amount of settlement can properly be awarded as damages.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">To this end, it was for the plaintiff/respondent to discharge its legal burden on a balance of probabilities. In contrast, as mentioned above (at [58]), the evidential burden is not stagnant. We were satisfied that the respondent had <i>prima facie</i> shown that the settlement figure was reasonable. The respondent had provided adequate particularisation of the process and methodology adopted in arriving at the settlement sum. It was certainly open to the appellant to articulate, at an early stage, its objections, if it had any. This, the appellant failed to do, and, despite the respondent\u2019s several requests for its involvement in the settlement process, it continued to give the respondent the cold shoulder.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several other factors supported our conclusion that the respondent had <i>prima facie</i> shown that the settlement reached was reasonable. First, the negotiations were long and protracted, with deep discounts given by CTL before they culminated in the eventual settlement sum of US$300,000. Second, Aube had painstakingly verified the figures in the EMC report which CTL used in support of its claim of US$300,000 against the respondent. Third, the settlement negotiations were carried out with legal advice from the respondent\u2019s in-house counsel. Fourth, the respondent has already made full payment of the settlement sum to CTL. Fifth, the respondent\u2019s attempts to engage the appellant and seek its participation in the settlement process fell on deaf ears. Sixth, the settlement process between CTL and the respondent was conducted at arm\u2019s length.\u00a0 The evidential burden thus moved to the appellant to show that the settlement was not reasonable.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that the initial proposed settlement amount was US$444,680. This was much greater than the final settlement sum of US$300,000. Aube had verified the figures, and it was for this very reason that CTL eventually agreed to the settlement. It bears mention that the respondent <i>did</i> pay CTL the settlement sum of US$300,000 without having an assurance that it would be reimbursed by the appellant. If the respondent was not satisfied with the quantum, it would, in all likelihood, have disputed the quantum. As Singleton\u00a0LJ wryly remarked in <i>Biggin &amp; Co (CA)</i> ([20] <i>supra</i>) at 325, \u201c[n]o one can think that a person or a company will agree to pay [\u00a343,000] damages lightly\u201d. In other words, we agreed that the respondent would not have paid US$300,000 as the final settlement sum if it did not think that the sum was reasonable.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also noted that the settlement was not hastily concluded; it was negotiated and moulded through nine months of serious negotiations between Ng and Hartzell, with an initial discount of US$50,000 on the claimed amount of US$444,680, and finally resulted in the settlement sum of US$300,000 (see [8] above). Taking into account, <i>inter alia</i>, Aube\u2019s painstaking verification efforts to ascertain the accuracy of the figures in the EMC report, it is apparent that the respondent behaved in a commercially reasonable manner.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Conclusion</font></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The analysis of whether a settlement is reasonable ultimately calls for the application of a common-sense approach, or put another way, principled pragmatism. A careful consideration of the evidence in the present case showed that there was absolutely no basis for the appellant to argue that the settlement between CTL and the respondent was not a genuine arm\u2019s length settlement and was not reasonable. Given that the negotiations took a period of nine months, with Aube rigorously scrutinising the claim, we rejected, without diffidence, the appellant\u2019s submission that the settlement amount was unreasonable.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before we conclude, it may be useful to touch on the role of in-house counsel in such settlements. On the facts, the respondent\u2019s in-house counsel played a key role in the settlement negotiations. We would like to highlight that it is not essential for legal advice to be invariably sought from external counsel. As long as the advice given is, when objectively viewed, independent, sensible and rational, it will be accorded some weight, regardless of the source. In other words, the identity of the legal adviser is not critical \u2013 what is crucial is, instead, whether the legal advice given is indeed prudent, sound and consistent with established legal principles. A party that relies on advice to arrive at a settlement must be prepared to have the reasonableness of that advice scrutinised, and even tested, if and when it seeks to invoke that settlement against an upstream defaulter. A settlement that is able to withstand the objective rigour of a court\u2019s scrutiny and inquiries is one that has been concluded on reasonable terms.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This decision also serves as a timely and salutary illustration that if parties, in particular, middlemen and part procurers, omit to include in their contracts clauses that legitimately limit their potential liability, they may find themselves confronted with responsibility for significant consequential losses.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the facts, it was plain that the damages claimed were not too remote and the settlement between the respondent and CTL was reasonable.

The two respondents in this case are Neo Kok Eng (the plaintiff in Suit No 136 of 2007/L) and Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd (the plaintiff in Suit No 137 of 2007/Q). We shall refer to them as \u201cNeo\u201d and \u201cthe Company\u201d respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"/>2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The four protagonists in this case are the Company; Neo who is managing-director and majority shareholder of Chip Hup Holdings Pte Ltd which wholly owns the Company; one Lim Leong Huat (\u201cLim\u201d) who was the Company\u2019s general manager, project director and executive director before his employment was terminated on 29 November 2006; and the appellant who was the Company\u2019s general manager before his employment was terminated on 1 February 2007.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"/>3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the appellant shared one of Lim\u2019s titles, that of general manager, it was not disputed that he was Lim\u2019s subordinate and took instructions from Lim. As for Neo and Lim, they enjoyed a close relationship before they fell out. Apart from being an employee of the Company, Lim was also the majority shareholder and, effectively, the owner of another company, AZ Associates Pte Ltd (\u201cAZ Associates\u201d). Neo and Lim\u2019s close relationship was reflected in the way the Company and AZ Associates (collectively \u201cthe two companies\u201d) were then being run. The two companies were both engaged in the building and construction business and shared the same telephone numbers, office premises and employees such as the accounting and administrative staff.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>Suit No 136 of 2007/L</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"/>4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suit No 136 of 2007/L was precipitated by an action, Suit No 779 of 2006 (\u201cSuit 779\u201d), brought by Lim on 21 November 2006 against the Company. In that suit, Lim claimed for the return of $7,205,000 which he alleged was the total amount of interest-free loans he had extended, at Neo\u2019s request, to the Company between July 2003 and September 2006. As a result, the Company investigated this claim and discovered that Lim had misappropriated various sums of money from the Company. In all, $6,083,741.06 worth of cheques which Neo had handed to Lim for the Company\u2019s use were allegedly diverted in the following ways: (a) in cash by Lim; (b) credited into the bank accounts of Lim, his wife or AZ Associates; or (c) credited into the Company\u2019s bank account but recorded as loans made by Lim or AZ Associates, to the Company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"/>5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to these discoveries, the Company denied Lim\u2019s claims in Suit 779 and counterclaimed against Lim, his wife and AZ Associates for the misappropriated monies. The Company obtained summary judgment against Lim for the sums of $347,030 and $426,740. Lim appealed against this summary judgment by way of Civil Appeal No 142 of 2007. In the meantime, pending the determination of the appeal, Lim paid up the two sums pursuant to the judgment. At the hearing of the appeal on 11 July 2008, the judgment against Lim was set aside by consent but on the condition that the Company could retain the two sums and be at liberty to deal with them. It was also agreed that in the event that Lim and/or his wife succeeded in defending the counterclaim in Suit 779, the two sums would be refunded on such terms as the trial judge might deem fit to impose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"/>6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following from the Company\u2019s investigations, Neo decided to procure, from United Overseas Bank Ltd, cheque images of the various personal cheques which he had handed over to Lim for the purposes of the Company. He discovered that two cheques, cheque number 378730 for $80,000 (\u201cthe $80,000 cheque) and cheque number 634684 for $100,000 (\u201cthe $100,000 cheque\u201d), were cashed by the appellant on 22 November 2000 and 4 April 2002 respectively. On the $80,000 cheque, against the \u201cpayee\u201d column, the defendant\u2019s name was inserted and on the $100,000 cheque against the same column the word \u201ccash\u201d was written. Neo recognised that those insertions, along with the date and the amount written on each cheque, were in Lim\u2019s handwriting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"/>7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 29 November 2006, while clearing out the office which Lim occupied, an invoice issued by AZ Associates dated 1 April 2003 was discovered. This invoice was issued by AZ Associates to the appellant in respect of the third progress payment for the construction of a house at No 189 Eng Kong Garden, Singapore 599287 (\u201cthe Eng Kong property\u201d). The words \u201cPAID ChqNo\u201d were stamped on the invoice and the words \u201c10/3/03 UOB 788740\u201d were handwritten alongside it. It transpired that UOB 788740 was a cheque for $260,000 which Neo had issued and handed over to Lim which Lim had subsequently handed over to AZ Associates. The construction of the house on the Eng Kong property was subsequently completed. This property, together with the house erected thereon, has since been sold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"/>8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having made these discoveries, Neo instituted Suit No 136 of 2007/L (\u201cSuit 136\u201d) to recover $440,000, being the total proceeds of the three cheques. All the three cheques were effectively bearer cheques as the word \u201cbearer\u201d appearing on the cheques was not crossed out. The action in Suit 136 was based on conversion and, in the alternative, for moneys had and received. In addition, Neo sought a declaration that the sale proceeds of the Eng Kong property was held by the appellant on trust for Neo and the appellant in the proportion of their contributions towards the purchase price (including the cost of constructing the house thereon) of the Eng Kong property, or, in such proportions as the court may determine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>Suit No 137 of 2007/Q</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"/>9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Suit No 137 of 2007/Q, the Company brought claims against the appellant (a) for $306,580, being overpayment made to him in respect of his salary for seven years between October 1998 and October 2006; (b) for breach of fiduciary duties; and (c) for $5,320, being overpayment made to him in respect of his salary for November 2006. The first two claims were subsequently discontinued. With regard to the third claim, which was based on mistake, the Company relied on its accounts staff, Khoo Choon Yean (\u201cKhoo\u201d), who had averred that she had overpaid the appellant the sum of $5,320 because she thought his salary for November 2006 was $11,920 when it should have been $6,600 per month. In respect of the sum of $6,600, we should clarify that the documentary evidence showed that the appellant\u2019s salary was, in fact, $6,800 per month and not $6,600.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"/>10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in Suit 137, the appellant had also counterclaimed for his salary and allowance for the period of 1 December 2006 to 7 March 2007. He alleged that he had tendered his resignation from the Company on 7 December 2006 by giving the requisite three months notice and his last day of employment would have been on 7 March 2007. He claimed that the Company had, in breach of the terms of his employment agreement, dismissed him earlier on 1 February 2007.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"/>11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the appellant sought to claim for his salary, transport and meal allowances up to 7 March 2007. Taking into account his receipt of the $11,920 and another $2,000 from the Company on 1 February 2007 as well as CPF contributions, he claims a remainder of $10,990.64 from the Company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"/>12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the Company\u2019s part, the reason why it had sought to terminate the appellant\u2019s employment on 1 February 2007 was because on that day Neo had confronted the\u00a0appellant regarding the cheques. Neo wanted to know why the proceeds of the $80,000 and $100,000 cheques went to the appellant and the proceeds of the $260,000 cheque, to the appellant\u2019s third progress payment for the construction of the house at the Eng Kong property. When the appellant gave no satisfactory answers to his queries, Neo terminated his employment forthwith. This conversation between Neo and the appellant was secretly recorded by the appellant and transcribed for the purposes of the trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Decision below</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"/>13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the course of the proceeding in the High Court, four interlocutory applications were made by the parties. The decisions of the court below on these applications are the subject of Civil Appeals No 42, 43, 44 and 45 of 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The Interlocutory Applications</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"/>14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first interlocutory applications pertained to the appellant\u2019s attempt to introduce evidence to prove that Neo\u2019s cheques were not issued as loans to the Company but were actually repayments to Lim for monies that Neo owed Lim. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d), Lim testified that Neo owed him money and had issued the three cheques to him as repayment. By way of Summons No 980 of 2008/C filed on 3 March 2008, Neo applied to strike out these paragraphs in Lim\u2019s AEIC (\u201cthe Striking-Out application\u201d). Neo argued that the offending paragraphs were irrelevant because they went towards proving facts which were not part of the appellant\u2019s pleaded case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"/>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The very next day, on 4 March 2008, the appellant, by way of Summons No 1003 of 2008/W, sought leave to file a Rejoinder (\u201cthe Rejoinder application\u201d) to achieve two things: first, to plead the facts alleged in the offending paragraphs in Lim\u2019s AEIC so as to prevent them from being struck out; and second, to introduce a defence against Neo\u2019s claim in conversion that the claim must fail because Neo had no right of possession of the cheques after he had handed them over to Lim. In the same summons, the appellant also applied to call the Company\u2019s auditor Lim Kok Khuang as an additional witness to give evidence on whether Neo consistently took the position that the cheques handed to Lim were loans to the Company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"/>16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Judge refused the appellant leave to file the Rejoinder for two reasons: first, Neo\u2019s Reply did not raise new allegations which had to be addressed by way of the proposed Rejoinder; and second, the appellant provided no satisfactory explanation as to why he was so late in pleading the aforementioned facts and defence. Without the Rejoinder, the offending paragraphs in Lim\u2019s AEIC had to be struck out since they did not relate to any part of the appellant\u2019s pleaded case. The Judge also refused the appellant\u2019s application to introduce the new witness because she was of the view that nothing that the Company auditor could say would be material to the case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"/>17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third application, made by way of Summons No 1107 of 2008, was to apply for leave to amend the appellant\u2019s Defence filed on 10 March 2008 (\u201cthe amendment of Defence application\u201d). The pleadings sought to be introduced were essentially the same as those in the proposed Rejoinder. The Judge likewise rejected this application.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"/>18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fourth application was an appeal by Neo against the Assistant Registrar\u2019s order to discover all the personal cheques which he had issued or had handed over to Lim for the purposes of the Company. Neo\u2019s counsel informed the Judge that if the discovery order was confined to discovery of the three cheques, he would have no objections to the discovery requested. The appellant\u2019s counsel confirmed that those were the cheques he wanted and the Judge thus limited the Assistant Registrar\u2019s order accordingly and made no order as to costs save that the appellant would reimburse Neo for disbursements incurred for the appeal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"/>19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We turn now to the Judge\u2019s decision on the merits of the two suits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>Suit No 136 of 2007/L</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"/>20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Judge held that the appellant converted the $80,000 and $100,000 cheque without Neo\u2019s consent. In her view, the lack of intention to convert the cheques or of knowledge that the cheques belonged to Neo, was irrelevant. In any event, the Judge found that the appellant knew that the cheques came from Neo and he could and should have inquired further or verified with Neo what Lim had told him with regard to the two cheques.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"/>21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Judge went on to consider the precondition to a right of action in conversion, <em>i.e</em>., that there must have been a demand for the converted goods. While she acknowledged that it was the Company and not Neo that made the demand, she held that there was no need for Neo to make the demand in February 2007 because it would have been futile since the appellant had long parted with the money. Accordingly, she found the appellant liable for converting the $80,000 and $100,000 cheques.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"/>22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Judge also rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the claim pertaining to the $80,000 cheque was time barred by s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). She, however, accepted the argument of Neo that since the alternative claim was for moneys had and received, which was not a claim in tort or contract, s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the said Act had no application.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"/>23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the $260,000 cheque, she held that the appellant could not have converted it since it was Lim who used it to pay AZ Associates for the third progress payment for the construction of the house on the Eng Kong property. However, the Judge held that Neo could succeed in his alternative action for moneys had and received. She found that the appellant could not deny that the cheque was applied towards the third progress payment for the construction of the\u00a0house and that he had also failed to establish the defence of change of position.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"/>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The declaratory relief sought by Neo was also granted. The Judge held that Neo could trace the proceeds of the three cheques amounting to $440,000 to the Eng Kong property. Therefore, the appellant held the sale proceeds of the property as constructive trustee on trust for Neo and the appellant in the proportions in which they contributed to the property. The Judge directed the Registrar to conduct an inquiry to ascertain their contributions. In coming to the conclusion that Neo could trace and follow the cheque proceeds into the Eng Kong property, the Judge also held that Lim was the true purchaser of the Eng Kong property and that the appellant was merely a nominee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>Suit No 137 of 2007/Q</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"/>25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the Company\u2019s claim against the appellant for monies paid to him by mistake, the Judge found that Khoo made an honest mistake by overpaying the appellant his salary in February 2007.

This was revealed in the Notes of Evidence which read as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><u>10 March 2008</u></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Time: 10.55 am</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Mr.] Ling [counsel for Neo]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am only appealing against one aspect of the order made by AR below.

As such, we do not think that it is now open to counsel to argue that the Judge erred when her order was clearly premised on his agreement with Neo\u2019s counsel\u2019s proposal to limit the scope of discovery to the three cheques which were the subject-matter of the action. In any event, even if the Judge had erred, the appeal would not be allowed unless the procedural irregularity or error would have affected the merits of the case (see s 40 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322, 2007 Rev Ed)). In the present case, we are unable to see how providing the appellant with access to the other cheques which Neo had issued would have affected the merits of the case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>(ii) The calling of the Company\u2019s auditor, Lim Kok Khuang, as an additional witness</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"/>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appellant sought to call Lim Kok Khuang, who was the Company\u2019s auditor, to testify so as to challenge Neo\u2019s claim that the cheques handed to Lim were meant to be loans for the Company. The appellant pointed out that every year, Neo signed off the Company\u2019s Annual Returns as being accurate even though the Annual Returns did not reflect the loans which Neo purportedly made to the Company through issuing the three cheques. The appellant wanted to call Lim Kok Khuang to give evidence on whether Neo consistently took this position every year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"/>33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There would have been merits in the appellant\u2019s application if Lim Kok Khuang had advised Neo on the Annual Returns and had witnessed Neo inspecting and signing off on them as being accurate. We appreciate that at the time when the application was made, Lim Kok Khuang\u2019s testimony might appear to be relevant. However, it emerged at trial that the Company\u2019s auditors including Lim Kok Khuang dealt only with Lim and not with Neo. Therefore, Lim Kok Khuang\u2019s testimony would have been of limited utility. He was not a material witness and his testimony would not have affected the merits of the case. There is therefore no basis to allow the appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision on this ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>(iii) The Rejoinder, amendment of Defence and Striking-Out application</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"/>34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Judge was right to refuse to grant leave to the appellant to file the Rejoinder. The purpose of requiring leave to be granted before a Rejoinder can be filed is to ensure finality in the pleading process. There must be an end at some stage (see <em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em> (Singapore: Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at [18/4/1]). The plea in the proposed Rejoinder consists of two parts: first, that Neo issued the $80,000 and $100,000 cheques to Lim as partial repayment of the monies which Lim had placed with Neo previously for the purposes of investing in shares; second, that the statutory presumption in s 21(5) of the Bills of Exchange Act (Cap 23, 2004 Rev Ed) would have applied with the result that Neo would have been presumed to have delivered the cheques to Lim unconditionally thereby giving up his right of possession to the cheques.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"/>35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These matters raised in the proposed Rejoinder were not a necessary response to the Reply. The appellant was in fact seeking to introduce new issues by way of the Rejoinder and this was certainly not in order. The proper avenue to raise these matters would have been by way of an amendment to the Defence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"/>36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, by the time the appellant realised this, it was too late. The amendment of Defence application was filed <em>after</em> Neo had given his testimony and was cross-examined on it. We agree with the Judge that allowing the amendment of Defence application at that stage would have been unfair and prejudicial to Neo. As was noted in <em>Sin Leng Industries Pte Ltd v Ong Chai Teck</em> <nobr>[2006] 2 SLR 235</nobr> at [23]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[T]he later an amendment to pleadings is sought, and especially so when it is sought in the middle of a trial, the more difficult it would be to say that justice lies in the direction of allowing the amendment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In the absence of countervailing reasons, the Judge did not err in exercising her discretion to disallow the application to amend the Defence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"/>37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Judge also did not err in allowing the Striking-Out application since the facts sought to be proven by the expunged paragraphs in Lim\u2019s affidavit of evidence-in-chief remain unpleaded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"/>38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the circumstances, we dismiss the appeals against the Judge\u2019s decisions on the interlocutory applications. We now turn to consider the merits of Suit No 136 of 2007/L.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Is Neo the proper party to bring the claim for the cheque proceeds?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"/>39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neo\u2019s claim in conversion, and alternatively, for moneys had and received, in respect of the cheque proceeds cannot succeed unless he can show that he is the proper party to bring the claim. It is settled law that a person has the right to sue for conversion only if he had, at the time of the conversion, either actual possession of, or the immediate right to possess, the goods converted (see <em>The Cherry</em> <nobr>[2003] 1 SLR 471</nobr> at [58] \u2013 [59] (\u201c<em>The Cherry\u201d</em>)). Neo must satisfy this threshold requirement before he can sue for conversion. If we accept Neo\u2019s averment that he issued the cheques as loans to the Company, which we must as that was the position he had taken, he would have given up his immediate right to possession of the cheques after he had passed them over to Lim. This is so as Lim received the cheques as the Company\u2019s agent. Neo himself admitted in cross-examination that he had handed the cheques over to Lim with Lim acting in his capacity as executive director of the Company. As agent of the Company, Lim entered into a loan agreement with Neo on behalf of the Company. As a result, when Neo passed the cheques to Lim, he had relinquished his title to them and received in return, a contractual right to recover the loan amount from the Company. Accordingly, title to the cheques had passed from Neo to the Company. If Lim subsequently misappropriated the cheques, then it would be for\u00a0the Company to bring the claim and not Neo. Neo is not left without a remedy. He would still have a right to sue the Company for repayment of the loan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"/>40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To get around this problem, Neo\u2019s counsel tried to rely on s 21(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Bills of Exchange Act to argue that Neo retained a right of possession to the cheques because the delivery of the cheques was conditional. Section 21(3)(<em>b</em>) provides that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As between immediate parties, and as regards a remote party other than a holder in due course, the delivery \u2013</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">...</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b) may be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Neo\u2019s counsel sought to argue that the delivery of the cheque was conditional on Lim using the cheque proceeds for the Company\u2019s benefit. He submitted that, because Lim failed to do so, Neo still retained title and thus the right of possession to the cheques.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"/>41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the delivery was indeed conditional, title to the cheques would not have passed. As Waller J in <em>Citibank NA v Brown Shipley</em> [1991] 2 All ER 690 rightly observed at 699: \u201cthe instrument only becomes a valid instrument on delivery.\u201d If Neo\u2019s counsel is right, then Neo would retain title and thus the right to sue. However, counsel appears to have failed to draw the important distinction between a condition for the use of the cheque proceeds and a condition pertaining to the delivery of the cheques. Section 21(3)(<em>b</em>) is concerned only with the latter. The learned editors of <em>Byles\u2019 Bills of Exchanges and Cheques</em> (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2007, 28<sup>th</sup> Ed) (\u201c<em>Byles</em>\u201d) make the following observations with regard to the English equivalent of s 21(3)(<em>b</em>):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As set out in s.21(2)(b) of the 1882 Act, delivery of an instrument can be shown to be conditional; however once the condition is fulfilled delivery is complete and the instrument is treated as having been issued or negotiated, as the case may be. In order for s.21(2)(b) to be operative it seems clear that any condition or special purpose must be communicated by the transferor to the transferee, since the commercial efficacy of the transaction depends upon the transferee knowing that he may not, <em>pro tem</em>, present or negotiate the instrument.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"/>42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the delivery of a cheque is conditional, the transferee may not present or negotiate the instrument. Such an act of delivering the cheque is inchoate to convey title in the cheque to the transferee and the transferor retains title to it. What constitutes a conditional delivery has been considered and expounded upon by the learned editors of <em>Chalmers and Guest on Bills of Exchanges and Cheques</em> (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2005, 16<sup>th</sup> Ed) (\u201c<em>Chalmers and Guest</em>\u201d) as follows at 121:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">\u2026it may be shown that the delivery was conditional or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill. Thus it may be shown that the delivery was in escrow, i.e. that the instrument was to be delivered so as not to take effect as a bill until a certain condition should have been fulfilled. Or it may be shown, for example, that the bill was indorsed and delivered so that it might be discounted or realised, the property not to pass until that time, or so that the indorsee might collect payment of the bill, but not with the intention of transferring to him the property in the bill. The condition or special purpose must, however, be communicated by the transferor to the transferee. A bill may also be delivered conditionally as collateral security, it being agreed that it will become operative only in the event of default.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"/>43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore the delivery of a cheque is conditional only if the transferor intends its delivery to remain inchoate until a certain condition is satisfied or if the delivery was made for some purpose other than that of transferring the title to the cheque to the transferee and makes this intention clear to the transferee. Section 21(3)(<em>b</em>) is therefore only concerned with conditions pertaining to the <em>delivery</em> of the cheque and not the <em>use of its proceeds</em>. Conditions specifying the manner in which the proceeds are to be used are different for they do not relate to the delivery of the cheque. In fact, they presuppose good delivery for only if delivery was good and the cheque effective, could the proceeds be withdrawn in the first place to be used in the manner specified by the condition. Consequently, even if we accept that Neo had imposed a condition on the use of the cheque proceeds, there was still good delivery of the cheques. Moreover, we would add that it is not open to Neo to contend that the condition for the delivery of the cheques to Lim was that they were to be deposited into the Company\u2019s account as loans to the Company. This is because the cheques were not made out to the order of the Company; neither did Neo cross out the \u201cbearer\u201d status of the cheques. Obviously Neo had contemplated that the cheques could be negotiated. Hence, on the facts before the court, we are of the view that Neo had intended at all times to pass property of the cheques to Lim as agent for the Company. He had relinquished title to the cheques and, in turn, his right of possession with the result that his claim in conversion must fail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"/>44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before we leave this issue, we will now turn to examine the cases relied upon by Counsel for Neo. When the circumstances of those cases are closely scrutinized it is clear that they are quite different and that explains why delivery in each case did not pass title to the bill. The first case is <em>Bell v Lord Ingestre</em> (1848) 12 QB 317 (\u201c<em>Bell</em>\u201d) where the facts were quite distinct and the bills were regarded to be held in escrow. This appeared clearly from the following comments of Patteson J at 320:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">\u2026for here it was not intended that the transferee should take any interest until the old bills were returned; and, until that time, it is the same thing, in principle, as if it had been intended that no interest should pass at any time. The bills were received on terms which were not satisfied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"/>45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second case was <em>Goggerley v Cuthbert</em> (1806) 2 Bos &amp; Pul (NR) 170 (\u201c<em>Goggerley</em>\u201d) where the bill was drawn by one Parnell in favour of the plaintiff, who indorsed it and put it into the hands of another called Daponte for the purposes of getting it negotiated and raising money upon it for the benefit of the plaintiff. However, Daponte gave the bill to his brother and it came into the hands of the defendant without consideration. In answer to the contention of the defendant that the plaintiff could not recover in trover, Mansfield CJ asked:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If Daponte, after receiving the bill, had betrayed an intention of obtaining the money and running away with it, could not the plaintiff have demanded the bill again of him? And if he could, why can he not demand it of any person into whose hands it comes dishonestly?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">The nature of this transaction was put succinctly by Heath J when he said \u201cthe delivery of the bill was not absolute, but conditional, and was in the nature of the delivery of an escrow.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"/>46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a clear difference between the position in <em>Goggerley</em> and that in the present case. Here the cheques were given by Neo as loans to the Company. The cheques were handed to Lim as the agent for the Company. By handing the cheques over to Lim, delivery was complete. No condition was imposed in respect of the delivery. Moreover, there is one other factor which undeniably showed that Neo did not care how the Company would deal with the cheques. By not crossing out \u201cbearer\u201d on the cheques, Neo intended that the Company could endorse them over to whomsoever it deemed fit. By leaving the cheques as bearer cheques, Neo could not have intended that the cheques should only be credited into an account of the Company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"/>47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third case is <em>North &amp; South Wales Bank Ltd v Macbeth</em> [1908] AC 137 (\u201c<em>Macbeth</em>\u201d) where the plaintiff was induced by the fraud of W to draw a cheque for 11,250<em>l</em> in favour of one Kerr. W obtained the cheque, forged Kerr\u2019s endorsement, and banked it into W\u2019s account with the defendant. The defendant was held liable to refund the proceeds of the cheque to the plaintiff. It would be seen that the delivery of the cheque to W was conditional, as he was to pass it on to Kerr. <em>Macbeth</em> also raised the question of whether Kerr was a \u201cfictitious person\u201d within the meaning of s 7(3) of the English Bills of Exchange Act 1882, an issue which does not concern us here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"/>48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next is the case of <em>Arnold v The Cheque Bank</em> (1876) 1 C P D 578 where a draft payable to the plaintiff or his order was indorsed by the plaintiff to W. The draft was later stolen by an employee of the plaintiff, who forged an indorsement of W. The defendant banker obtained the proceeds of the draft on behalf of someone who was not entitled to the draft. The court held the defendant to be liable to the plaintiff. Lord Coleridge CJ at 584 emphasised that for property to the draft to be passed, besides the physical delivery, there must be an intention to transfer the property in the draft. As the draft was the subject of theft, title to it never left the plaintiff.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"/>49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The final case is <em>Clifford Chance v Silver</em> [1992] 2 Bank LR 11 where a cheque was indorsed by the purchaser\u2019s solicitors to the vendor solicitors towards payment of deposit but on condition that it was \u201creturnable on demand until we are able to authorise you to effect an exchange\u201d. The English Court of Appeal held that the initial delivery of the cheque was conditional but that it became unconditional when the contracts for the sale of the property were exchanged and the conditions stipulated were fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"/>50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the circumstances of the present case, and for the reasons alluded to above, it was the Company which had title to the cheques and the latter was thus the proper claimant of the cheque proceeds and not Neo. Neo\u2019s assertion that he intended the\u00a0cheques to be credited only into an account of the Company cannot reasonably be sustained and is inconsistent with the objective facts. This probably explains why the Company had demanded the proceeds of the $80,000 and $100,000 cheque from Lim and why it had brought a claim against Lim in Suit No 779 of 2006 for the proceeds of the $260,000 cheque.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"/>51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this juncture, we should allude to a related argument of Neo which is that for a party to be in a position to sue for conversion all he needs establish is an immediate right to possession of the thing and not ownership thereof. As Neo was the Managing Director of the Company, and was the superior of both Lim and the appellant, he was in a position to require Lim and the appellant to return the three cheques to Neo. On this basis, it was argued that Neo retained the immediate right to possession of the three cheques at the point of conversion. It seems to us that in making this argument, Neo overlooked the fact that Neo could so compel Lim and/or the appellant to return the cheques to him only because of his position as the Managing Director of the Company. This argument in fact works against him and reinforces the point that the cheques belonged to the Company and it is only by virtue of his position as Managing Director that he could ask Lim/the appellant to return the cheques back to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"/>52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neo\u2019s alternative claim for moneys had and received is contingent on him proving his claim in conversion. It fails along with his inability to prove the existence of the tort. This is so because Neo\u2019s alternative claim in restitution is premised on a \u201cwaiver of the tort.\u201d The House of Lords has made it clear in <em>United Australia v Barclays Bank Ltd</em> [1941] 1 AC 1 that the \u201cwaiver\u201d was really an election to take a gain-based rather than loss-based award for the tort. In the absence of the tort, this claim in restitution fails. As Viscount Simon LC explained (<em>ibid</em> at 18):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">When the claimant \u2018waived the tort\u2019 and brought assumpsit, he did not thereby elect to be treated from that time forward on the basis that no tort had been committed; indeed, <em>if it were to be understood that no tort had been committed, how could an action in assumpsit lie? It lies only because the acquisition of the defendant is wrongful and there is thus an obligation to make restitution</em>. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Since Neo\u2019s claim for conversion is unsustainable, it follows that his claim for restitution of the tort also fails. Simply put, he cannot \u2018waive the tort\u2019 when there is no tort to waive in the first place. In any event, as the cheques were issued as loans to the Company, if any loss was suffered, it was on the part of the Company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"/>53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, the appeal on the merits of Suit No 136 of 2007/L is allowed. Since the appellant has succeeded only on one issue, that of the proper claimant, he is only entitled to costs pertaining to this issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The sum of $5,320 was not paid out by mistake</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"/>54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We turn now to consider the merits of the claim in Suit No 137 of 2007/Q. For the Company to succeed in its claim against the respondent for the $5,320, it will need to show that the transfer of $11,920 to the appellant was caused by a mistake of fact. The parties do not dispute that the Company has been paying the appellant more than the $6,800 to which he is entitled to as his salary from the Company. However, nowhere in the transcript of the exchange between Neo and the appellant on 1 February 2007 does it show that Neo complained about this overpayment, despite Neo not being unaware of it. In fact, Khoo, who joined in the conversation, said the following:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">December you were paid this amount 11,920, but we are going to take out this amount, it is for CHHK. Then for this month, we will net off this one. So the balance is this. This is the net amount, so <em>for the CHHK portion</em>, which is only 6600, this part is deducted out. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"/>55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Khoo\u2019s remarks with regard to the $11,920 are very telling. These remarks are contrary to her assertion that she had typed the figure into the payroll system by mistake; that it was a typographical error. Khoo did not say the payment was a mistake. Instead, her remarks suggest that part of the payment was on behalf of the Company; that it was \u201cfor the CHHK portion.\u201d She did not clarify on whose behalf the other portion was paid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"/>56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This, however, would not matter. It is clear from Khoo\u2019s remarks that the full sum of $11,920 was not paid because of a mistake of fact and that the excess was for some other unspecified purpose. It follows that the Company\u2019s claim for the $5,320 cannot be sustained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Was there any basis for the appellant\u2019s summary dismissal</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"/>57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now turn to consider the counterclaim of the appellant in Suit No 137 of 2007/Q. As mentioned earlier at <a href=\"#p1_10\">[10]</a>, the appellant had given the required three-month notice to resign which would have taken effect on 7 March 2007. Notwithstanding the resignation notice, the Company would still be entitled to dismiss the appellant for cause, although the burden would be on the Company to show the\u00a0reason justifying the earlier termination of the appellant\u2019s employment on 1 February 2007. In the absence of a ground for summary dismissal, the employment contract should be allowed to take its course.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"/>58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What then were the grounds on which the Company relied upon to justify the summary dismissal of the appellant? The basic contention of the Company in this regard is that the appellant had been dishonest having misappropriated the cheque proceeds. It is a well-established principle that an employee owes the employer a duty of good faith and fidelity, an aspect of which includes the employee not making use of the employer\u2019s property for his own purposes (see <em>DM Divers Technics Pte Ltd v Tee Chin Hock</em> <nobr>[2004] 4 SLR 424</nobr>; see also generally Ravi Chandran, <em>Employment Law in Singapore</em> (Singapore: LexisNexis, 2008, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed) at paras [5.12] - [5.14]). If it can be shown that the appellant was dishonest by misappropriating the Company\u2019s property, then there would be a justifiable basis for his summary dismissal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"/>59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we have found that the Company had title to the cheques (see <a href=\"#p1_51\">[51]</a> above), it was entitled to seek an explanation from the appellant as to why he had cashed the $80,000 and $100,000 cheques and why the $260,000 was applied to the third progress payment for the construction of the house at the Eng Kong property. The Judge found that the appellant could and should have inquired further or verified with Neo what Lim had told him with regard to the $80,000 and $100,000 cheques. We agree with the Judge. Apart from the $260,000 cheque which never came into the hands of the appellant but was handed directly to AZ Associates by Lim, the fact that the other two cheques which were handed to the appellant were drawn from Neo\u2019s account and bore Neo\u2019s signature would have put the appellant on inquiry. The appellant had ample opportunity to inquire further or verify with Neo what Lim had told him with regard to these cheques but did not do so. In fact, when confronted on 1 February 2007 by Neo, the appellant still did not provide an explanation to Neo of what had transpired between Lim and him. In these circumstances, we find that the Company was entitled to summarily dismiss the appellant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"/>60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We therefore allow the appeal pertaining to Suit 137 of 2007/Q only in part but dismiss the Company\u2019s claim for the overpayment of $5,320.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"/>61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To recapitulate, with regard to CA 42, 43, 44 and 45, we hold that the Judge did not err in her decisions on the interlocutory applications and therefore dismissed the appeals with costs. As for the appeal in CA 157 relating to Suit 136 of 2007/L, we would allow it on the ground that Neo was not entitled to sue for conversion of the three cheques. The appellant shall be entitled to costs on this issue. With regard to the appeal in CA 157 pertaining to Suit 137 of 2007/Q, we would allow it in part as we have held that the Company was entitled to summarily dismiss the appellant. However, as the Company has failed to recover the sum of $5,320 from the appellant, we think a fair order as to costs on these two issues (<em>ie</em> recovery of $5,320 and summary dismissal) would be to make no order on them. The security for costs lodged in CA 157 shall be returned to the appellant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"/>62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The costs of the hearing below in relation to Suit 136 of 2007/L shall be awarded to the appellant subject to the qualification that costs shall be confined to work touching on the question of the <em>locus standi</em> of Neo to sue. There will be no order as to costs in Suit 137 of 2007/Q.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

He was the first plaintiff in the action below. The second plaintiff, Combined Overseas Transport Sdn Bhd (`Combined`), is a company owned and controlled by him. The defendants in the action were Casetech Trading Pte Ltd (`Casetech`), Stephen Wiffen (`Wiffen`), his wife, Stevany Wiffen (`Mrs Wiffen`) and Lars Arne Kent Linden (`Linden`). The Wiffens reside in Singapore and are directors of Casetech, which is in the business of dealing in cranes and construction related equipment. Linden is a Swedish businessman, who used to reside in Kuala Lumpur and was a former director of Casetech.<br/><br/><strong><i> The facts </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The relevant facts giving rise to the dispute have been sufficiently set out in the judgment below, which we respectfully adopt. Briefly they were as follows. Friis first met Linden sometime in 1989 at the Danish club in Kuala Lumpur, and thereafter socially from time to time. Arising from their conversations on these occasions, Friis learnt that Linden was in the business of supplying construction related equipment and had businesses in Malaysia and Singapore. On one such occasion, Linden mentioned that he had a business partner in Singapore and he had some cash flow difficulties as a result of a project having gone wrong. Friis  intimated that he might be able to offer some financial assistance. However, nothing developed from that conversation, until Linden wrote to Friis on 6 July 1990 outlining a proposal to Friis and inviting him to take up a 33% share in Casetech, in return for which Friis would provide financial assistance by arranging for the opening of letters of credit up to a maximum limit of $1m to finance Casetech`s operations, and also provide security for a bank overdraft to Casetech up to a limit of $100,000. In that letter, Linden said that he was one of two partners of Casetech and would welcome Friis as an equal partner. Linden proposed that he, his partner and Friis should meet on 11 or 12 July 1990 for further discussions.<br/><br/>Soon after this, Friis met Linden and Wiffen at the Lake Club in Kuala Lumpur. He learnt from them that Casetech bought cranes and construction related equipment for re-sale by way of `back-to-back` trade, and that it would only purchase equipment from a seller when there was already a purchaser at hand. They told him that this trade had been financed by way of letters of credit arranged by a company called Cawthorne Trading Pte Ltd. Casetech`s business was managed mainly by Wiffen in Singapore. Linden and Wiffen owned Casetech and had an equal share of its profits after giving Cawthorne their share. After a discussion on Friis` proposed involvement, the parties came to the following broad agreement (`the 1990 oral agreement`):   </p>\n    <p>(1) Friis would help Casetech finance its trade on a case-by-case basis by procuring and obtaining letters of credit to be opened by the branch of Citibank at Kuala Lumpur; </p>\n    <p>(2) In return, Friis would be entitled to one third of the profits of the trade; </p>\n    <p>(3) The transactions financed by Friis would be back-to-back trades only, and not the purchase of stocks or anything that would put the funds at risk; </p>\n    <p>(4) Friis would be regularly provided with a full account of all sales and purchases of equipment made by Casetech that were financed by him; and </p>\n    <p>(5) Friis would be reimbursed all expenses incurred by him in financing the trades.<br/><br/>Linden also proposed at the meeting that Friis should take up one-third of the shares in Casetech as well as a directorship in that company, but no agreement was reached in this respect at the time. Later, Wiffen sent him a Form 45, which is a form of consent to act as a director, for him to sign, but Friis said that he eventually decided against this proposal.<br/><br/>Pursuant to the 1990 oral agreement, the parties from August 1990 undertook a series of transactions financed by Friis in the following manner. Linden would request Friis to procure a letter of credit to be established and Friis would instruct his bank, Citibank at Kuala Lumpur, to open the letter of credit. On a few occasions, Friis obtained bank drafts to pay for the equipment. These transactions were profitable and Wiffen submitted monthly reports to him.<br/><br/>After a while, the parties found that applying for letters of credit and bank drafts was cumbersome, and in early 1991 a variation was made to the financing arrangement. Friis had an account with Den Danske Bank, Singapore (`DDB`) and he obtained from them a bank guarantee for $950,000 to secure the facilities granted to Casetech by Deutsche Bank, Singapore (`DB`). The DB facilities  included an overdraft account and facilities for letters of credit. Casetech used the DB facilities to finance its crane trading operations. In June 1992, Casetech obtained similar facilities from the Singapore branch of The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (`HSBC`) in place of DB. This was also secured by a DDB`s guarantee for $1m procured by Friis. These foregoing facilities will be collectively referred to as `the overdraft facilities`. These arrangements made in 1991 and 1992 were, in effect, a variation of the 1990 oral agreement. Instead of procuring a letter of credit to be opened on a case by case basis, Friis procured a banker`s guarantee to secure the overdraft facilities to finance the back-to-back trades of construction related equipment. There was no other change to the terms of the 1990 oral agreement.<br/><br/>The arrangement appeared to work smoothly until sometime in late October or early November 1992, when Linden called Friis and informed him that something was amiss in Casetech`s accounts. However, Linden assured him that he would sort it out. Later, on 30 December 1992, DDB informed Friis that HSBC had called on the guarantee and in consequence DDB had deducted a sum of $1m from his account with them to effect the payment.<br/><br/>Wiffen and Linden then arranged a meeting with Friis in Kuala Lumpur on 31 December 1992 to discuss the matter. This was held at the office of the auditors Ernst &amp; Young. They discussed how Friis was to be repaid the $1m. Wiffen and Linden agreed that Casetech would sell whatever equipment they had and direct the proceeds of sale towards repayment to Friis (`the December 1992 agreement`). With this in mind, a list detailing Casetech`s assets was drawn up, which primarily consisted of the equipment available for sale and their estimated selling prices. It was found that the total of the estimated sale proceeds of the equipment was close to what was needed to repay Friis. Wiffen and Linden then apportioned the responsibility between themselves for the sale of the individual equipment. All the designated items of equipment were to be sold by 31 March 1993. It was also agreed that rental proceeds from those items of the equipment then rented out would also be applied towards the repayment to Friis. All proceeds received from sales and all rentals would be paid into a new account in which Friis would be the sole signatory.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, only a total sum of $97,390.30 was paid into that account in March and April 1993 and thus received by Friis. In fact, before any money was received, he was asked by Wiffen in January 1993 to pay out a sum of $27,103.22, being the freight due on one item of the equipment in order to secure its release. Friis paid this sum and thus only received a net sum of $70,287.08 pursuant to the December 1992 agreement, leaving a balance of $929,712.92 unpaid.<br/><br/>Friis did not take any action until some years later. He considered that the antagonism that had developed between Linden and Wiffen, over the events leading to and after the December 1992 agreement, would prevent any possibility of recovery. However, in early 1998, Linden came forward with information that the DDB`s guarantee was called on as a result of a misuse of the overdraft facilities. That prompted him to take action against all the parties concerned.<br/><br/>Friis brought the present action on 7 July 1998 and he joined his company, Combined, as the second plaintiff. We shall hereafter refer to Friis and Combined,  where appropriate, as the plaintiffs. In the action the plaintiffs claimed against Casetech, Wiffen, Mrs Wiffen and Linden, inter alia, the balance sum of $929,712.92 as damages for breach of contract on the ground that they were contractually bound to use the overdraft facilities only for the back-to-back trade as agreed, but that they had instead used the facilities for other types of trades resulting in the loss. Alternatively, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants, save for Mrs Wiffen, held the overdraft facilities on trust and had acted in breach of trust in the use of the facilities. Mrs Wiffen was sought to be made liable as an accessory to the breach of trust, on the ground that she knowingly assisted the three defendants in the breach. Accordingly, the plaintiffs sought an account from the defendants of the use of the overdraft facilities and all profits made from their use. Only Casetech, Wiffen and Mrs Wiffen resisted the claim; Linden, however, did not enter an appearance and defend the claim, although the writ was served on him. Eventually, judgment in default was entered against him.<br/><br/><strong><i> The decision below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Dealing first with the claim against Mrs Wiffen, the trial judge found that there was no evidence that she was involved in any contract with the plaintiffs. Friis did not allege that she had participated in any of the discussions he had with Wiffen and Linden. Mrs Wiffen`s evidence was that she was not involved in any of the dealings between Wiffen and Friis, and that she was merely an employee of Casetech during part of the relevant period. Accordingly, the learned judge dismissed the claim of $929,712.92 against her.<br/><br/>Turning to the claim against Casetech the learned judge found that Wiffen`s evidence was only a bare denial and none of the defendants had contended that the sum of $929,712.92 was not due to the plaintiffs. On the evidence, he found that there were clear breaches of the 1990 oral agreement (as varied in 1991 and 1992) in the use of the overdraft facilities, and that Friis had only received $70,287.08. Accordingly, the learned judge held that the plaintiffs were entitled to the sum of $929,712.92 as damages for breach contract and entered judgment against Casetech for that amount.<br/><br/>On the question whether Wiffen was personally liable to Friis for that sum, the trial judge found that both Wiffen and Linden were parties to the 1990 oral agreement and therefore were personally liable to the plaintiffs for damages for breach of the 1990 oral agreement. Thus, he also entered judgment against Wiffen for that amount.<br/><br/>The learned judge next turned to the plaintiffs` claim for an account on the ground that Casetech, Wiffen and Linden were constructive trustees of the funds from the overdraft facilities provided by DB and subsequently by HSBC which were guaranteed by the bank guarantee procured by Friis. Here again he dismissed the claim against Mrs Wiffen, as accessory to the breach of trust alleged to have been committed by the three of them, on the ground that she was only an employee and later a director of Casetech at the material time, and there was nothing which supported such a claim. The learned judge found that plaintiffs had not proved that she was a constructive trustee or that she was an accessory to any breach of trust.<br/><br/>The learned judge found that the arrangement made between, on the one hand, Wiffen and Linden and, on the other, Friis was `akin to a partnership arrangement` and he imposed a constructive trust on the funds in the DB account and subsequently, the HSBC account. He held that both Linden and Wiffen were trustees of the funds and were accountable to Friis for the use of those funds. The defendants were thus liable to account for the profits made from the improper use of the facilities. However, the plaintiffs filed the writ on 7 July 1998, and therefore any claim for account for the period of more than six years from that date, ie before 7 July 1992, was time-barred by virtue of s 6(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) and their remedy of account was limited to the funds paid out of the HSBC overdraft account from 7 July 1992 onwards. In respect of the period of limitation, the learned judge found that there was no fraud or fraudulent concealment of any breach of trust postponing the running of the time under s 29(1) of the Limitation Act, as the defendants had merely mixed their own funds in the overdraft account without any intent to defraud.<br/><br/>Lastly, the learned judge ordered that interest be paid on the judgment sum and any sum found due on the taking of accounts, and this interest was to run only from the date of writ. For convenience, we shall hereafter refer to Casetech, Linden and Wiffen as `the defendants`, where appropriate.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeals </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Against the decision of the learned judge two appeals were filed. Civil Appeal 203/99 was filed by the plaintiffs, and CA 204/99 was filed by Casetech, Wiffen and Mrs Wiffen. From the respective cases filed the appellants have appealed against numerous points dealt with by the learned judge in his judgment, and their cases have raised a host of issues. For our purpose, the issues which we need to decide are the following:   </p>\n    <p>(a) whether Wiffen was a party to the 1990 oral agreement; </p>\n    <p>(b) whether there was a constructive trust or any trust over the funds from the overdraft facilities; </p>\n    <p>(c) whether Mrs Wiffen was an accessory to the breach of trust which the learned judge held that the defendants had committed; </p>\n    <p>(d) whether Mrs Wiffen should be awarded costs below; </p>\n    <p>(e) whether any part of the claim for the sum of $929,712.08 as damages for breach of contract was time-barred; and </p>\n    <p>(f) whether interest on the judgment sum and sum found on the taking of account should run from the date of writ as ordered by the learned judge.<br/><br/>Our decision on these issues would resolve all the material points raised in their respective cases.<br/><br/><strong><i> The 1990 oral agreement </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We deal first with Wiffen`s personal liability under the 1990 oral agreement. Counsel for Wiffen contends that the trial judge`s finding on the personal liability of Wiffen under the 1990 oral agreement was erroneous. He complains that the learned judge placed too much emphasis on the contradictions in Wiffen`s  testimony on whether he met Friis in Kuala Lumpur and failed to consider that Friis` evidence was vague and plagued by memory lapses.<br/><br/>In our view, there is absolutely no merit in Wiffen`s appeal on this issue. The learned judge considered the evidence adduced before him at great length. He properly tested both the evidence of Wiffen and that of Friis against other evidence before him and entertained serious doubts on the credibility of Wiffen`s evidence. On the other hand, he found that the evidence of Friis was consistent with the other evidence and in particular with the documentary evidence produced. He accepted Friis` evidence that Casetech was merely a vehicle that Linden and Wiffen used to conduct the transactions, and that he did not have any idea of the makeup of Casetech and therefore would not have provided the financial assistance (which he did), if he had not had the assurance from both Linden and Wiffen that they would be personally liable. The learned judge rejected Wiffen`s evidence that he was not a party to the arrangement made at the meeting at Kuala Lumpur and that he was not present at that meeting. The learned judge arrived at the following conclusion at [para ] 19 of his judgment:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Taking the evidence in its entirety, and comparing the demeanour of Friis and of Wiffen and the consistency of their versions with the documents and the surrounding factual matrix, I conclude that Wiffen was at the Lake Club meeting in July 1990 and that the 3 of them arrived at the oral agreement as Friis claims. Both Wiffen and Linden were parties to the oral agreement and therefore personally liable to the Plaintiffs in respect of damages arising from their breaches of its terms.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The learned judge was amply justified in coming to this conclusion, and we agree with him entirely. Given the fact that Wiffen was at the time Linden`s partner, that the arrangement made was to provide finance for the operations of Casetech in Singapore, and that Wiffen himself was in charge of such operations, it would be surprising if he could implement the arrangement agreed with Friis without having been involved in the negotiations with Friis and coming to an agreement with him. We ourselves are also unable to accept Wiffen`s evidence that he did not participate in the negotiations with Friis at Kuala Lumpur and was not a party to the arrangement made with Friis.<br/><br/><strong><i> Constructive trust </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now turn to the question of constructive trust as found by the learned judge, which is the most important issue in these appeals. It is necessary to consider what the arrangement made between, on the one hand, Linden and Wiffen and, on the other, Friis, was. The terms of this arrangement, namely the 1990 oral agreement, have been set out in [para ] 3 above, and there does not appear to be any dispute with regard to such terms. The arrangement was varied in 1991 and 1992. The learned judge made the following finding on this arrangement at [para ] 22 of his judgment:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>As concerns CTL and Wiffen, the facts before me are as follows. Wiffen and Linden had entered into an oral agreement with Friis in July 1990 wherein Friis would procure financing for CTL`s trades in equipment in return for which Friis would receive one third of the profit. Initially the financing was done by way of LCs and bank drafts procured by Friis. This proved cumbersome and in early 1991 this method was changed. On the security of a DDB guarantee procured by Friis, CTL obtained credit facilities in  DB up to $950,000. In June 1992, the DB account was closed and credit facilities for up to $1m was obtained under CTL`s HSBC account. This was also secured by a DDB guarantee procured by Friis.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It is implicit that the overdraft facilities, provided by DB or later by HSBC secured by the bank guarantee procured by Friis, were to be used solely for the back-to-back trading of equipment as contemplated in the 1990 oral agreement, although such a term was not expressly spelt out in the variations made in 1991 and 1992. It was clearly a term of the 1990 oral agreement that the transactions to be financed by Friis were to be confined to the back-to-back trades only. It could not have been the intention of Friis, in 1991 and 1992, to provide security to finance the use of the overdraft facilities for other purposes.<br/><br/>The learned judge found that Casetech had used the overdraft facilities for purposes other than financing the back-to-back transactions contemplated in the 1990 oral agreement, and that Wiffen and Linden did not bother to keep separate the two types of transactions. After referring to the case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Coulthard v Disco Mix Club Ltd &amp; Ors</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1999] 2 All ER 457</font>, he said at [para ] 25:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I do not find the <strong> Coulthard</strong> case to be relevant to the question of whether Wiffen and Linden owed the plaintiffs a fiduciary duty in this case. There was an arrangement in which Friis had, in effect, placed $1m of his money at the disposal of Wiffen and Linden in order that they may carry out the undertaking. It is akin to a partnership arrangement and I can see no reason not to impress Wiffen and Linden with a constructive trust over the funds in the DB account and subsequently, the HSBC account.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>This is the core finding on the basis of which the learned judge held that the funds in the overdraft accounts with DB and HSBC were impressed with constructive trust. With respect, we are unable to agree with this finding. Friis did not `in effect, [place] $1m of his money at the disposal of Wiffen and Linden`. Friis merely provided security in the form of a bank guarantee to secure the overdraft facilities provided by Casetech`s bank, which was first DB and later HSBC. Friis himself was quite clear in his own mind of what he had provided for Casetech, namely, a bank guarantee of $1m to secure Casetech`s overdraft facilities. In giving evidence in the cross-examination he said as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>Q: After all, you yourself invested $1m in Casetech based on an oral agreement.  </p>\n        <p>A: I did not invest $1m in Casetech Trading. I did not invest $1m in the venture, I provided a $1m guarantee.  </p>\n        <p>Q: You had exposed yourself to $1m liability based on an oral agreement alone?  </p>\n        <p>A: Yes.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Thus what Friis had provided was a bank guarantee for $1m to secure the overdraft facilities of Casetech. It is true that these overdraft facilities were to be used solely for the purpose of back-to-back trades and not for other transactions of Casetech. But that restriction on the use was based on the terms of the 1990 oral agreement (as varied); it was purely contractual and did not arise out of the creation of any trust. The funds made available by Casetech`s bank on the overdraft facilities and utilised by Casetech, whether for the back-to-back trading in compliance with the agreement or for other purposes in breach of the agreement, did not belong to Friis in law or in equity. Nor were these funds held in trust for Friis. In our opinion, neither Linden nor Wiffen was at any time a  trustee for the plaintiffs or either of them and consequently no breach of trust was committed by either Linden or Wiffen.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the question remains whether by reason of the 1990 oral agreement, as varied in 1991 and 1992, Linden and Wiffen stood in any other fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs and in particular Friis. As we have held, both Linden and Wiffen were in a contractual relationship with Friis: they were both parties to the 1990 oral agreement made with Friis, as varied in 1991 and 1992. The question is whether this contractual arrangement also gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between, on the one hand, Linden and Wiffen and, on the other, Friis, such that the former became fiduciaries of the latter. We think not. The arrangement made between them was purely a commercial financing arrangement whereby Friis would provide security for the overdraft facilities to finance certain transactions to be carried out by Casetech and in return would receive a share of the profits. Such an arrangement did not give rise to a fiduciary relationship.<br/><br/>In this respect, there is a material feature in this financing arrangement which bears mentioning. Under the 1990 oral agreement, there was no requirement or obligation on the part of Linden and Wiffen that any or all of the back-to-back trades undertaken by Casetech were to be financed by the use of the overdraft facilities. Casetech was entitled to act entirely in its own self-interest in determining when the overdraft facilities were to be used, and when it should use its own funds for the purpose. Casetech was certainly at liberty, at any time, to enter into transactions, even if they were back-to-back trades of equipment, with its own resources without the use of the overdraft facilities, and in such case would be entitled retain the profits from such transactions wholly for itself. It is implicit from the terms of the agreement made with Friis that Friis would only be entitled to a one-third share of the profits from the back-to-back transactions actually financed by the overdraft facilities. The corollary of this is that Friis had no right to participate in the management of the back-to-back trades or determine which trades were to be accepted. Thus, if and when the overdraft facilities (secured by the bank guarantee procured by Friis) were used for such trading, then and only then would Friis be entitled to a one-third share of the profits.<br/><br/>Arising from the change in the arrangement made in 1991 and 1992 in the way in which the back-to-back transactions of Casetech were to be financed, there was no doubt greater confidence and reliance reposed by Friis in Wiffen and Linden to effectuate the purposes of the 1990 oral agreement. Confidence and reliance per se, however, have never been a touchstone of a trust or fiduciary relationship in a commercial context. Otherwise, almost every contractual relationship involving some form of confidence or reliance (unilateral or mutual) would give rise to a fiduciary relationship between the parties concerned.<br/><br/>We find the Australian case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corp</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1984] 156 CLR 41</font> of some assistance. Briefly the facts there were these. An American company was the manufacturer of surgical stapling products which were made of its own design and marketed under the name of `Auto Suture`. The company appointed a dealer to be the sole distributor of the stapling products in Australia. After the appointment, the dealer went about setting up the  distributorship. He acquired from the company a large quantity of demonstration products. He caused them to be sterilized and then sold them in competition with or in substitution of the company`s products. Later, he also manufactured his own products locally and deferred filling orders for the company`s products but instead filled the orders with his own products. The company instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, claiming, inter alia, a declaration that the dealer`s assets were held on constructive trust and other consequential orders. The trial judge held that a fiduciary relationship existed between the parties, that the dealer had acted in breach of his fiduciary duty and ordered an account of profits. On appeal, the Court of Appeal declared that there was a constructive trust over the dealer`s assets in favour of the company. On further appeal, the High Court of Australia held, inter alia, that the dealer was in breach of the distributorship agreement and, by a majority, that there was no fiduciary relationship between the parties. Gibbs CJ said at p 72:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>An examination of all the circumstances confirms in my opinion that the relationship between the parties was not a fiduciary one. It is true that USSC relied on HPI to promote the sale of its products and left it to HPI to determine how it should go about doing so, and that HPI had it in its power to affect USSC`s interests beneficially or adversely. However, there are two features of the case, in particular, which together constitute an insuperable obstacle to the acceptance of USSC`s contention that a fiduciary relationship existed between itself and HPI. In the first place, as I have said, the arrangement was a commercial one entered into by parties at arm`s length and on an equal footing. ... An ordinary commercial contract made in those circumstances, even as a result of fraud, is unlikely to give rise fiduciary to obligations. Secondly, it was of course clear that the whole purpose of the transaction from Mr Blackman`s point of view, as USSC knew, was that he, and later HPI, should make a profit.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Dawson J at p 147 made the following general observations:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The circumstances in which the contract between USSC and Blackman was made do not suggest any disadvantage or vulnerability on the part of USSC requiring the intervention of equity to protect its interests. Those negotiations were of a commercial nature and were at arm`s length. They were conducted by persons on both sides who were experienced in the market place ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It may be conceded that USSC eventually accepted that there was no need for a formal agreement because of the misplaced trust which Hirsch and Josefsen had in Blackman`s integrity and ability. But that is not the sort of trust or confidence which equity will protect by the imposition of fiduciary obligations. <strong> A fiduciary relationship does not arise where, because one of the parties to a relationship has wrongly assessed the trustworthiness of another, he has reposed confidence in him which he would not have done had he known the true intentions of that other.</strong> In ordinary business affairs persons who have dealings with one another frequently have confidence in each other and sometimes that confidence is misplaced. That does not make the relationship a fiduciary one ... A fiduciary relationship exists where one party is in a position of reliance upon the other <strong> because of the nature of the relationship and not because of a wrong assessment of character or reliability</strong>. That is to say, the relationship must be of a kind which of its nature requires one party to place reliance upon the other; it is not sufficient that he in fact does so in the particular circumstances ... [Emphasis is added]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In our opinion, the 1990 oral agreement made between, on the one hand Linden and Wiffen and, on the other, Friis, as varied in 1991 and 1992, was purely a commercial financing arrangement, whereby Friis would provide security for  the overdraft facilities financing the back-to-back trading of equipment and in return would receive a one-third share of the profits. In our judgment, the rights of the parties are purely contractual, and neither Linden nor Wiffen stood in any fiduciary relationship with Friis and none of the defendants were fiduciaries of Friis or his company, Combined. In the words of Dawson J, the circumstances in which the agreement was made did not suggest any inherent disadvantage or vulnerability on the part of Friis requiring the intervention of equity to protect his interests. The negotiations conducted were of a commercial nature and were at arm`s length.<br/><br/><strong><i> Account of profits </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The learned judge ordered that an account of the profits be taken of the use of the funds withdrawn from the overdraft facilities, on the ground that the defendants held those funds in trust for the plaintiffs and in breach of trust had used the funds for other purposes. As we have now held that the defendants were not trustees of the funds, and also did not stand in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, it follows that there was no breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the defendants. The defendants had committed a breach of contract and for such breach an award of damages has been made.<br/><br/>The question now is whether in this case the plaintiffs are entitled to an account of the profits derived from the use of the funds. We revert once again to the terms of the 1990 oral agreement, the terms of which have been set out in [para ] 3 above and it is unnecessary to replicate them here. Under the terms of the agreement, as varied in 1991 and 1992, the transactions to be financed by the overdraft facilities were to be confined to the back-to-back trading of equipment, and Friis was given to understand that Casetech would only purchase the equipment from the seller when there was a ready purchaser therefor, and consequently only profits from such transactions were contemplated. On the basis of such terms as agreed, no sharing of any loss from these trades was stipulated and agreed, and Friis was insulated from any loss arising. In other words, under the 1990 oral agreement, as varied in 1991 and 1992, Friis would not be responsible for any loss occasioned by such back-to-back transactions, and would not have to bear any part of it.<br/><br/>It is not in dispute that Casetech had used funds from the overdraft facilities provided by DB and later by HSBC for the purpose of financing back-to-back transactions of equipment, and also for other purposes. The learned judge said at [para ] 22:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>There is evidence that CTL had used the overdraft in the DB and the HSBC accounts for purposes other than financing transactions under the oral agreement. What happened was that Wiffen and Linden had not bothered to keep separate the two types of transactions. Wiffen also gave evidence that although the funds were mixed, at all times the amount drawn down did not exceed the cost of equipment purchased under the oral agreement.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In so far as the funds from the overdraft facilities had been used for the purpose of the back-to-back transactions - and these transactions had been agreed by the parties - Casetech had not breached the agreement made with Friis. As we have  said above, if losses were incurred in any of such transactions, Friis would not be responsible for such losses and would not have to bear any part thereof. On the other hand, if profits were made, as the parties had contemplated, Friis was entitled to a one-third share thereof, as provided in the agreement. Thus, under the 1990 oral agreement, as varied in 1991 and 1992, Friis is entitled to an account of his share of the profits, and an order should be made for an account to be taken of the profits from such transactions but limited to the transactions occurring after 7 July 1992. This is purely a contractual right to an account.<br/><br/>We now turn to the use of the funds from the overdraft facilities for purposes other than financing the transactions under the 1990 oral agreement. Such use of funds by Casetech was clearly in breach of the agreement, and such breach was not disputed by Casetech or Wiffen. The remedy for a breach of contract is an award of damages. Subject to what is said below on restitutionary damages, the general rule is that damages awarded for breach of contract are compensatory and are intended to compensate the innocent party for the loss he has sustained and not to disgorge the gain the wrongdoer has made and transfer it to the innocent party. The object is to put the innocent party, so far as money can do so, in the same position as if the contract had been performed. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Tito &amp; Ors v Waddell &amp; Ors (No 2)</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1977] 1 Ch 107</font>, 332, Megarry V-C said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[I]t is fundamental to all questions of damages that they are to compensate the plaintiff for his loss or injury by putting him as nearly as possible in the same position as he would have been in had he not suffered the wrong. The question is not one of making the defendant disgorge what he has saved by committing the wrong, but one of compensating the plaintiff.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The question now is whether, in addition to the award of damages, the plaintiffs are entitled to an account of profits derived from the use of the funds in breach of the agreement. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Siboen; Occidental Worldwide Investment Corp v Skibs A/S Avanti &amp; Ors</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1976] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 293</font>, where, among other things, the owner of the two vessels on charter to the charterers wrongfully withdrew the vessels in breach of the charterparties, it was held that the charterers were entitled to damages in respect of the remainder of the charter periods, and not to an account of the profits the shipowner had derived from a more lucrative employment of the vessels elsewhere. Kerr J said, at p 337:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In respect of the remainder of the charter periods they [the charterers] claim either an account of the profits which the owners made from the use of the ships or alternatively damages. I can see no basis for the charterers being entitled to an account of the profits made by the owners. If they are entitled to anything they are entitled to damages in the normal way on the ground that the owners wrongfully repudiated charter-parties by withdrawing the ships from their service.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It is helpful to refer also to  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Surrey County Council &amp; Anor v Bredero Homes Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1993] 3 All ER 705</font>. There, two local county councils, who were the owners of two parcels of adjoining land, sold the land to a developer. In the sale contract, the developer undertook to obtain planning permission for the development of the site in accordance with the councils` scheme. Such planning permission was duly obtained by the developer. The developer subsequently applied and obtained fresh planning permission which enabled it to build more houses than the number specified in the scheme approved by the councils. In breach of contract, the  developer proceeded to build the houses, and the houses were eventually completed and were sold. On being sued by the councils, the developer conceded the breach of contract, but argued that the councils were entitled only to nominal damages. Both the judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal held that the councils had not suffered any loss and were not entitled to recover any substantial damages. The headnote of the case states:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The remedy at common law for breach of contract was the award of damages to compensate the victim for his loss, not to transfer to the victim, if he had suffered no loss, the benefit which the wrongdoer had gained by his breach of contract. Furthermore, the innocent party was to be placed, so far as money could do so, in the same position as if the contract had been performed. Although damages might in an appropriate case cover profit which the injured plaintiff had lost, they did not cover an award to the plaintiffs of the profit which the defendant had gained for himself by his breach of contract when the plaintiff had himself suffered no loss. Since the plaintiff councils had not suffered any loss, it followed that the damages recoverable had to be merely nominal.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Dillon LJ said at p 709:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[T]he remedy at common law for a breach of contract is an award of damages and damages at common law are intended to compensate the victim for his loss, not to transfer to the victim, if he has suffered no loss, the benefit which the wrongdoer has gained by his breach of contract.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Later his Lordship said at p 712:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Given that the established basis of an award of damages in contract is compensation for the plaintiff`s loss, as indicated above, I have difficulty in seeing how Sir William Goodhart`s suggested common law principle of awarding the plaintiff, who has suffered no loss, the gain which the defendant has made by the breach of contract, is intended to go.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Steyn LJ, the other member of the court, while agreeing with Dillon LJ on the award of damages, went further to consider whether the plaintiffs were entitled to restitutionary damages. His Lordship said at p 714:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>An award of compensation for breach of contract serves to protect three separate interests. The starting principle is that the aggrieved party ought to be compensated for loss of his positive or expectation interests. In other words, the object is to put the aggrieved party in the same financial position as if the contract had been fully performed. But the law also protects the negative interest of the aggrieved party. If the aggrieved party is unable to establish the value of a loss of bargain he may seek compensation in respect of his reliance losses. The object of such an award is to compensate the aggrieved party for expenses incurred and losses suffered in reliance of the contract. These two complementary principles share one feature. Both are pure compensatory principles ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>There is, however, a third principle which protects the aggrieved party`s restitutionary interest. The object of such an award is not to compensate the plaintiff for a loss, but to deprive the defendant of the benefit he gained by the breach of contract. The classic illustration is a claim for the return of goods sold and delivered where the buyer has repudiated his obligation to pay the price. It is not traditional to describe a claim for restitution following a breach of contract as damages. What matters is that a coherent law of obligations must inevitably extend its protection to cover certain  restitutionary interests. How far that protection should extend is the essence of the problem before us.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Having said this, his Lordship went on to consider various authorities and the circumstances of the case, and declined to allow restitutionary damages: see p 715.<br/><br/>It is perhaps pertinent to mention that in the very recent case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>A-G v Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd, third party)</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1998]  Ch 439</font>, the Court of Appeal in England considered (without however the benefit of any argument) the question of retitutionary damages as a proper remedy for breach of contract, and held obiter that there are at least two situations in which justice requires the award of restitutionary damages where compensatory damages would be inadequate. The first is where the defendant fails to provide the full extent of the services which he has contracted to provide and for which he has charged the plaintiff. The second is where the defendant has obtained his profit by doing the very thing which he contracted not to do: see p 458.<br/><br/>Reverting to the case at hand, the learned judge has made an award of damages for breach of contract. That award is to compensate the plaintiffs the loss they had sustained. In our judgment, the plaintiffs are not entitled, in addition, to have an account taken of the profits derived from the use of the funds by Casetech in breach of contract. In any event, even if the plaintiffs were so entitled, we would not be disposed to make such an order in this case, as the defendants did not appear to have made any profits from such use but had sustained a loss, and it would be futile to order an account to be taken of the profits, if any. For completeness, we would add that this is not a case where an award of retitutionary damages is an appropriate remedy.<br/><br/>We therefore set aside the order made below for the taking of accounts, and in lieu thereof order an accounts to be taken of the profits made from the use of funds from the overdraft facilities for the back-to-back trades or transactions which the parties had agreed, but such taking of accounts be limited to the back-to-back transactions occurring after the 7 July 1992. In respect of the earlier period, the claim for an account is time-barred.<br/><br/><strong><i> Claim against Mrs Wiffen as an accessory to breach of trust </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>As there was no breach of trust committed by Linden or Wiffen, the question of Mrs Wiffen`s involvement as an accessory to the breach of trust as alleged by the plaintiffs does not arise. We would dismiss such claim against her.<br/><br/><strong><i> Mrs Wiffen`s costs below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The plaintiffs` claims against Mrs Wiffen for damages for breach of contract and for an account of profits as an accessory to the alleged breach of trust failed and were dismissed by the trial judge. However, the learned judge did not make an order awarding her any costs. She now appeals against the failure or refusal to make such an order.<br/><br/>Presumably, the learned judge took the view that she, Wiffen and Casetech were represented by the same firm of solicitors and by the same counsel in court,  and that she and Wiffen filed a joint defence, and no extra time and expenses were incurred in her defence. We think that in this case some extra time and expenses were incurred in preparing for her defence. She filed her affidavit evidence in defending the claims and she gave evidence in court on the extent of her involvement in the matters alleged by the plaintiffs. In our opinion, an order as to costs should have been made in her favour. We would allow her appeal.<br/><br/><strong><i> The limitation defence in respect of the claim for $929,712.92 </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Casetech and Wiffen raised the defence of limitation under s 6 (1) of the Limitation Act in respect of a part of the claim for damages for breach of contract. The amount of damages was quantified in the sum of $929,712.92, after deducting the amount paid to Friis from the proceeds of sale or rentals pursuant to the December 1992 agreement. That amount was part of the outstanding sum of $1m on the overdraft account with HSBC at the time, when the call was made on DDB`s guarantee and Friis` account with DDB was debited with the sum of $1m. That was on or about 30 December 1992. Counsel for Casetech and Wiffen submits that the plaintiffs` right of action for damages for breach of contract arose with each amount overdrawn on the overdraft account, and as at 6 July 1992, the overdraft account with HSBC was overdrawn by a sum of $563,510.78, and this represented part of the damages which, in counsel`s submission, was time-barred. Accordingly, the amount of damages awarded should be reduced by this amount.<br/><br/>We are unable to accept this argument. The sum of $929,712.72 was the balance of the losses which amounted to $1m. On or about 30 December 1992, HSBC called on the DDB`s guarantee for payment of the $1m, and that amount was paid by DDB and debited to the account of Friis. The $1m represented the total amount of the losses incurred by Casetech in or arising out of its performance of the 1990 oral agreement, as varied in 1991 and 1992. Part payments amounting in total to $70,287.08 were made in March and April 1993, leaving the balance of $929,712.72, which was the amount claimed in the action. The claim for this amount or any part thereof is therefore, in our view, not time-barred.<br/><br/>It should be borne in mind that the overdraft account with HSBC was a running account on a fluctuating basis, and deposits to and withdrawals from the account were made from time to time. Assuming that the debit balance on the overdraft account stood at $563,510.78 as at 6 July 1992, thereafter there were made from time to time deposits to and withdrawals from that account, and each deposit made would have gone towards payment, in whole or in part, of the amount withdrawn in breach of the agreement. This account had throughout been maintained as a running account, and the outstanding amount was crystallized only when HSBC demanded payment of the sum of $1m and called on the DDB`s guarantee.<br/><br/>At any rate, under the financing arrangement made between the parties, there was an implied obligation by the defendants to indemnify Friis against any loss, and this implied indemnity could only be invoked when the DDB`s guarantee was called on by HSBC and the amount paid by DDB was debited to his account. The time on this claim by Friis did not begin to run until the call was made and the  amount was paid under the guarantee and debited to Friis` account. It was only then that the true extent of the defendants` liability could be ascertained.<br/><br/><strong><i> Interest on judgment debt </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The trial judge awarded interest on the sum of $929,712.92 and any sum found due under the account of profits from the date of writ. The plaintiffs challenge this exercise of discretion under s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Ed) on the ground that it is a departure from the general practice of awarding interest from the date of accrual of loss, that is 31 December 1992, when HSBC called on the DDB`s guarantee.<br/><br/>Although the general rule as contended for by the plaintiffs is indeed established, the principal exception of this rule is unwarranted delay by the plaintiff: <strong><i> McGregor on Damages </i></strong>, para 658, 668-669. This factor was expressly considered by the learned judge in his judgment (at [para ] 29), where he noted that Friis was content to sit on his claim for five years before taking any action. The plaintiffs have not offered any other reasonable explanation for the delay. Further, an award of interest covering the period from date of writ to date of judgment is not without precedent in such a context, although other methods are more common: see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Metal Box v Currys</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1988] 1 All ER 341</font>.<br/><br/>The plaintiffs rely on  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Mahtani &amp; Ors v Kiaw Aik Kang Land Pte</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1995:1:168:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1995:1:168:\">  [1995] 1 SLR 168 </a> in support of the argument that to disallow such interest from the date of accrual of loss would allow the defendants to profit from their own breach of contract. That case is, however, distinguishable for the simple reason that there, the defendants had the use of the money which was the subject of claim, whereas here, the judgement sum represented compensation for loss suffered which was never represented by any sum held by the defendants. We consider, therefore, that there is no compelling reason in principle to interfere with the exercise of discretion below and this order should continue to apply.<br/><br/><strong><i> Conclusion </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the reasons given, we allow CA 204/99 to the extent as follows: we set aside the order made below for a taking of accounts, and in lieu thereof, order an account to be taken of the profits made from the use of the overdraft facilities for the back-to-back trades or transactions which the parties had agreed, but such taking of account be limited to the back-to-back transactions occurring after the 7 July 1992. We also award interest on the amount found due on the taking of such account at the same rate as that awarded below, such interest to run from the date of the writ. We allow Mrs Wiffen`s appeal on costs, and award her the costs of defending the claims below.<br/><br/>Turning to the costs of this appeal, we award Mrs Wiffen the costs of her appeal. As regards Casetech and Wiffen, they have succeeded in part only, and there are numerous points they took in this appeal, on which they failed. We therefore award them only 30% of the costs of their appeal. The deposit in court as security for costs is to be refunded to the appellants or their solicitors, together with interest, if any.<br/><br/>We dismiss CA 203/99 with costs. The deposit in court as security for costs is to be paid to the respondents in this appeal or their solicitors, with interest, if any, to account of costs.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n    <p>Order accordingly.<br/><br/></p>\n  </body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\8\\E\\8e0ddd41512347d90cf7b7a20d366513\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"46849\" id=\"46849-M\" uniqueid=\"d1c9253d-0079-43f7-97a7-efe5db2efd61\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/46849-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2005-03-17T17:43:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2005-03-16T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2005</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2005</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>12</No>\n      <NCit>[2005] SGCA 12</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2005</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>12</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2005] SGCA 12</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>Chia Kok Leong and Another v Prosperland Pte Ltd</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Chia Kok Leong and Another v Prosperland Pte Ltd</SortTitle><SortDate>2005-03-16T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA 76/2004</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#3\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Appellant</Role>\n        <Name>Chia Kok Leong</Name>\n        <Name>D.

The first defendant, Civic Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cCivic\u201d), was the main contractor for the construction of the condominium. The second and third defendants, Mr\u00a0Chia Kok Leong (\u201cChia\u201d) and D\u00a0Exodus Architects &amp; Planners Pte (\u201cExodus\u201d), the appellants herein, were the architects engaged in the design and supervision of the project, with Chia being the person in charge of the project.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The construction of the condominium was completed in August 1993. In May 1998, the Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No\u00a02201 (\u201cthe MCST\u201d) was constituted, which, by virtue of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap\u00a0158, 1988\u00a0Rev Ed), became the proprietor of the common property of the condominium.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 2\u00a0May 2002, Prosperland commenced an action against Civic for defective works, <i>ie</i>, de-bonding of the tiles forming the external fa\u00e7ade of the building and damage of the glass blocks installed in the lobbies and stairways. In the action, it also claimed against Chia and Exodus for breach of contract in failing to exercise due care in the design and supervision of the project which resulted in the defective works.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, by the time the defects appeared and the action was instituted, Prosperland was no longer the owner of the condominium. The individual units in the condominium had been transferred to third parties. The common areas of the condominium had become vested in the MCST. Prosperland had not yet spent any money to effect the repairs. Neither had it been sued by the MCST in respect of the defects. While Prosperland was placed under voluntary liquidation in December 2002, the MCST has not, to date, filed any proof of debt with the liquidators of Prosperland to date.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that Civic and the supplier of the adhesives gave Prosperland a ten-year warranty by way of a deed guaranteeing the construction and the adhesive used in the construction of the external wall tile fa\u00e7ade. The MCST was not a party to this deed of warranty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of these undisputed facts, Civic and the appellants asked the court to rule on two sets of preliminary issues. They were:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the claims in respect of the external fa\u00e7ade of the building and the glass blocks were time-barred; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether Prosperland was the proper party to sue in respect of these claims.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the first issue, the judge held that Prosperland\u2019s claim in respect of the glass blocks was time-barred but its claim in respect of the wall tiles was not. On the second issue, the judge held that Prosperland was the proper party to sue the defendants and could claim for substantial damages.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Civic did not appeal against the aforesaid rulings. Neither did Prosperland with regard to the ruling on the time bar in respect of the glass blocks. However, Chia and Exodus, being dissatisfied, have taken the matter on appeal before us. Thus, the issues which require the determination of this court are:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether Prosperland can claim against the appellants for substantial damages, even though Prosperland has suffered no loss and the MCST has, following two decisions of this court, a direct legal remedy in tort against the appellants; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether Prosperland\u2019s claim against the appellants for the alleged damage to the wall tiles is time-barred.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Title to sue for substantial damages</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The general rule in law is that a plaintiff is entitled to claim damages only for the actual loss suffered on account of a breach of contract. This is because damages are compensatory in nature. Damages are awarded to put the injured party, as far as possible, in the position he would have been in had there been no breach. When the innocent party suffers no actual loss on account of the breach, he would only be entitled to nominal damages. But there are exceptions which we will now examine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the earliest cases which seems to have created an exception to this rule is <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> (1839) 6\u00a0Cl\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Fin\u00a0600; 7\u00a0ER 824, a case where goods shipped on board a vessel were lost due to a general average sacrifice. The case held that the consignor could recover substantial damages against the shipowner if there was privity of contract between him and the carrier for the carriage of goods. However, if by the time of the action the goods were not his property, or at his risk, he would be accountable to the true owner for the proceeds of judgment. This decision was made before the enactment of the Bills of Lading Act 1855 (c\u00a0111) (\u201cB/L\u00a0Act\u201d) which gave the indorsee of a bill of lading a direct right of action against the shipowner on the terms of the bill of lading.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rule in <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> came under scrutiny in the recent case of <i>The Albazero</i> <nobr>[1977] AC 774</nobr>, where the preliminary question of law raised for the consideration of the court was whether the charterer of a bill of lading, having endorsed it over to a third party, was still entitled to claim for substantial damages upon the vessel and its cargo becoming a total loss in the course of the voyage. At the time of the loss, the plaintiff-charterer had already indorsed the bill of lading, but it was only received by the indorsee the day after the loss occurred. The plaintiff claimed that the measure of damages which it was entitled to recover was the arrived value of the goods lost notwithstanding that at the time the goods were lost, it no longer had any property in the goods and suffered no loss by reason of their non-delivery at the destination. Lord\u00a0Diplock, who delivered the sole judgment of the House of Lords, thought that the exception created by <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> should not be unnecessarily extended and he rationalised the decision in this manner (at 847):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]n a commercial contract concerning goods where it is in the contemplation of the parties that the proprietary interests in the goods may be transferred from one owner to another after the contract has been entered into and before the breach which causes loss or damage to the goods, an original party to the contract, if such be the intention of them both, is to be treated in law as having entered into the contract for the benefit of all persons who have or may acquire an interest in the goods before they are lost or damaged, and is entitled to recover by way of damages for breach of contract the actual loss sustained by those for whose benefit the contract is entered into.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, with the enactment of the B/L\u00a0Act, the indorsee of a bill of lading would be entitled under the B/L\u00a0Act to enforce the contract directly. There would then be no ground on which one could impute to the parties an intention that the consignor was entering into the contract for the benefit of others who would acquire the property in the goods but would acquire no right of action for breach of contract. Thus, Lord\u00a0Diplock held that the plaintiff in <i>The</i> <i>Albazero</i> could not claim for substantial damages. We would respectfully say that this is in line with logic. The rule in <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> was created to get around the undesirable consequences of the privity rule. There would be no such undersirable consequences if it is within contemplation that \u201cthe carrier will also enter into separate contracts of carriage with whoever may become the owner of goods carried pursuant to the original contract\u201d: <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Diplock in <i>The Albazero</i> at 847\u2013848.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, this does not mean that the rule in <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> should be consigned to legal history. While the B/L\u00a0Act would reduce the scope and utility of the rule in <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> where goods are carried under a bill of lading, the rule can still apply to other contracts for the carriage of goods where such automatic assignment of the rights of action for breach does not take place. It is also important to note that while Lord\u00a0Diplock recognised that since <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> the law of negligence had developed, he felt that the latter did not \u201cprovide a complete substituted remedy for some types of loss caused by breach of a contract of carriage. Late delivery is the most obvious example of these\u201d: see <i>The Albazero</i> at 846\u2013847.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next case which must be considered is that of <i>St Martins Property Corporation Ltd v Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd</i> <nobr>[1994] 1 AC 85</nobr> (\u201c<i>St Martins</i>\u201d) where the court extended the application of the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> exception to a different setting, <i>ie</i>, a building contract. In <i>St Martins</i>, the first plaintiff (\u201cCorporation\u201d), who was the leasehold owner of the land, entered into a building contract with the defendant, McAlpine. One of the terms of the contract was that \u201c[Corporation] shall not without the written consent of the [defendant] assign the contract\u201d. Later, Corporation, without the defendant\u2019s consent, assigned the land and the benefits under the contract to the second plaintiff. Subsequently, the building was found to be defective and the cost of remedial works would amount to about \u00a3800,000. The English Court of Appeal, affirming (by majority) the decision of the official referee, held that the assignment was ineffective. However, the court unanimously reversed the decision of the official referee and held that Corporation was entitled to substantial damages. The House of Lords upheld the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision on both counts. Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson, delivering a judgment with which three other law lords concurred (namely, Lord\u00a0Keith of Kinkel, Lord\u00a0Bridge of Harwich and Lord\u00a0Ackner), said that the case fell within the rationale of the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> exception to the general rule that a plaintiff could only recover damages for his own actual loss. He explained (at 114\u2013115):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The contract was for a large development of property which, to the knowledge of both Corporation and McAlpine, was going to be occupied, and possibly purchased, by third parties and not by Corporation itself. Therefore it could be foreseen that damage caused by a breach would cause loss to a later owner and not merely to the original contracting party, Corporation. As in contracts for the carriage of goods by land, there would be no automatic vesting in the occupier or owners of the property for the time being who sustained the loss of any right of suit against McAlpine. On the contrary, McAlpine had specifically contracted that the rights of action under the building contract <i>could</i> not without McAlpine\u2019s consent be transferred to third parties who became owners or occupiers and might suffer loss. In such a case, it seems to me proper, as in the case of the carriage of goods by land, to treat the parties as having entered into the contract on the footing that Corporation would be entitled to enforce contractual rights for the benefit of those who suffered from defective performance but who, under the terms of the contract, could not acquire any right to hold McAlpine liable for breach. It is truly a case in which the rule provides \u201ca remedy where no other would be available to a person sustaining loss which under a rational legal system ought to be compensated by the person who has caused it.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In answer to the argument that this was an exceptional case and that if the court were to accord to the plaintiff a right to substantial damages in such a case it would produce chaos when applied to other cases where the contractors had entered into direct warranties with the ultimate purchasers of the individual parts of a development, Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson clarified (at 115):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I am far from satisfied that this is a one off or exceptional case. We are concerned with standard forms of building contracts which prohibit the assignment of the benefit of building contracts to the ultimate purchasers. In the prolonged period of recession in the property market which this country has experienced many developments have had to be sold off before completion, thereby producing the risk that the ownership of the property may have become divided from the right to sue on the building contract at a date before any breach occurs. As to the warranties given by contractors to subsequent purchasers, they will not, in my judgment, give rise to difficulty. If, pursuant to the terms of the original building contract, the contractors have undertaken liability to the ultimate purchasers to remedy defects appearing after they acquired the property, it is manifest the case will not fall within the rationale of <i>Dunlop v. Lambert</i>, 6\u00a0Cl. &amp; F.\u00a0600. If the ultimate purchaser is given a direct cause of action against the contractor (as is the consignee or endorsee under a bill of lading) the case falls outside the rationale of the rule. The original building owner will not be entitled to recover damages for loss suffered by others who can themselves sue for such loss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fifth member of the quorum, Lord Griffiths, while he came to the same conclusion as the other four law lords, felt that the plaintiffs should be entitled to claim for substantial damages on a much broader basis (\u201cthe broad ground\u201d) than that stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson (\u201cthe narrow ground\u201d). Lord\u00a0Griffiths said (at 96\u201397):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I cannot accept that in a contract of this nature, namely for work, labour and the supply of materials, the recovery of more than nominal damages for breach of contract is dependent upon the plaintiff having a proprietary interest in the subject matter of the contract at the date of breach. In everyday life contracts for work and labour are constantly being placed by those who have no proprietary interest in the subject matter of the contract. To take a common example, the matrimonial home is owned by the wife and the couple\u2019s remaining assets are owned by the husband and he is the sole earner. The house requires a new roof and the husband places a contract with a builder to carry out the work. The husband is not acting as agent for his wife, he makes the contract as principal because only he can pay for it. The builder fails to replace the roof properly and the husband has to call in and pay another builder to complete the work. Is it to be said that the husband has suffered no damage because he does not own the property? Such a result would in my view be absurd and the answer is that the husband has suffered loss because he did not receive the bargain for which he had contracted with the first builder and the measure of damages is the cost of securing the performance of that bargain by completing the roof repairs properly by the second builder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should add that the broad ground advocated by Lord\u00a0Griffiths was not opposed to by Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson who, in fact, found it attractive. However, Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson felt that, before he finally took that position, it would be prudent to expose this broad ground to academic consideration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Griffiths distinguished <i>The Albazero</i> on the basis that the case was not concerned with money being paid to enable the bargain, <i>ie</i>, the contract of carriage, to be fulfilled. There the claim was for the loss of the cargo. Moreover, in <i>The Albazero</i>, at the date of the breach of contract, the property in the cargo which was lost was vested in another person with a right to sue for the loss under the terms of the bill of lading. In Lord\u00a0Griffiths\u2019 view, the basis for allowing the plaintiff-employer in <i>St Martins</i> to recover substantial damages was the loss of his \u201cperformance interest\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The broader approach to the issue advocated by Lord\u00a0Griffiths in <i>St\u00a0Martins</i> was the subject of consideration in the House of Lords in the subsequent case of <i>Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd v Panatown Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] 1 AC 518</nobr> (\u201c<i>Panatown</i>\u201d). There, where the House was split by three to two, Panatown Ltd employed McAlpine to construct a building on land owned by a third party, UIPL, a company related to Panatown Ltd. The work was defective and considerable expenses would have to be incurred by UIPL to put things right. Panatown Ltd argued that it had the right to sue for substantial damages pursuant to <i>The Albazero</i> exception. The dispute went to arbitration. The preliminary question that arose for consideration was (as stated at 520):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Is Panatown Ltd] debarred from recovering substantial as opposed to nominal damages by reason of the fact that it is not and was not the owner of the land[?]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The arbitrator answered the question in the negative. The High Court overturned that ruling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Court of Appeal, which followed the narrow ground enunciated by the majority in <i>St Martins</i>, Panatown Ltd was awarded substantial damages on the footing that it would account for them to UIPL. However, in the House of Lords, the majority restored the ruling of the High Court and held that Panatown Ltd was not entitled to claim for substantial damages notwithstanding the breach of the building contract on the part of McAlpine. This decision turned on one fact which was special to the case and which, in the opinion of the majority, was decisive. There, besides the building contract with Panatown Ltd, McAlpine also entered into a duty of care deed (\u201cDCD\u201d) with UIPL, the owner of the site. Under the DCD, UIPL acquired a <i>direct remedy</i> against McAlpine in respect of any failure by McAlpine to exercise reasonable skill, care and attention in carrying out its obligations under the main building contract. Furthermore, under the DCD it was expressly provided that UIPL could assign the DCD to its successors-in-title or to any other party with the consent of McAlpine and such consent was not to be unreasonably withheld. On the majority ruling, the existence of the DCD made all the difference as it meant that there was no legal black hole whatsoever. Lord Clyde reasoned as follows (at 531\u2013532):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The duty of care deed and the collateral warranties were of course not in themselves building contracts. But they did form an integral part of the package of arrangements which the employer and the contractor agreed upon and in that respect should be viewed as reflecting the intentions of all the parties engaged in the arrangements that the third party should have a direct cause of action to the exclusion of any substantial claim by the employer, and accordingly that the exception should not apply. There was some dispute upon the difference in substance between the remedies available under the contract and those available under the duty of care deed. Even if it is accepted that in the circumstances of the present case where the eventual issue may relate particularly to matters of reasonable skill and care, the remedies do not absolutely coincide, the express provision of the direct remedy for the third party is fatal to the application of <i>The Albazero</i> exception. On a more general approach the difference between a strict contractual basis of claim and a basis of reasonable care makes the express remedy more clearly a substitution for the operation of the exception. Panatown [Ltd] cannot then in the light of these deeds be treated as having contracted with McAlpine for the benefit of the owner or later owners of the land and the exception is plainly excluded.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson, the second majority member in <i>Panatown</i>, also rejected the argument that the contractual relief afforded by the DCD was of a more limited kind than what Panatown Ltd could have obtained under the building contract and thus should not exclude the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> or <i>The Albazero</i> exception. He said (at 576\u2013577):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It was suggested in argument that the purpose of the DCD was to give purchasers of the site from the Unex Group undoubted causes of action for breach of a tortious duty of care. Even if that is so, it does not alter the fact that under the DCD, UIPL itself has the right to claim substantial damages for any negligent performance of the building contract, a right which will cover most of the claims arising under the building contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In my judgment the direct cause of action which UIPL has under the DCD is fatal to any claim to substantial damages made by Panatown [Ltd] against McAlpine based on the narrower ground. \u2026 If the contractual arrangements between the parties in fact provide the third party with a direct remedy against the wrongdoer the whole rationale of the rule disappears.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would be recalled that in <i>St Martins</i>, Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson, in commenting on the broader approach advocated by Lord\u00a0Griffiths, thought it prudent to leave the question for further scrutiny by academic writers before the House should finally rule on it. While in <i>Panatown</i> Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson noted that the academic writings thus far did not show that there would be serious difficulties in adopting Lord\u00a0Griffiths\u2019 broader approach, he did not take the occasion to embrace it. Instead, assuming that the broad ground was sound in law, he held that Panatown Ltd had no right to substantial damages because UIPL had a direct cause of action under the deed. In view of this, he did not think that Panatown Ltd had any more \u201cperformance interest\u201d as explained by him as follows (at 577\u2013578):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If, as in the present case, the whole contractual scheme was designed, inter alia, to give [UIPL] and its successors a legal remedy against McAlpine for failure to perform the building contract with due care, I cannot see that Panatown [Ltd] has suffered any damage to its performance interests: subject to any defence based on limitation of actions, the physical and pecuniary damage suffered by [UIPL] can be redressed by [UIPL] exercising its own cause of action against McAlpine. It is not clear to me why this has not occurred in the present case: but, subject to questions of limitation which were not explored, there is no reason even now why [UIPL] should not be bringing the proceedings against McAlpine. The fact that the DCD may have been primarily directed to ensuring that [UIPL\u2019s] successors in title should enjoy a remedy in tort against McAlpine is nothing to the point: the contractual provisions were directed to ensuring that [UIPL] and its successors in title did have the legal right to sue McAlpine direct. So long as [UIPL] enjoys this right Panatown [Ltd] has suffered no failure to satisfy its performance interest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson then went on to illustrate why Panatown Ltd should not in the circumstances be accorded relief for substantial damages (at 578):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Let me illustrate this by postulating a case where, before the breach occurred, [UIPL] had with consent assigned the benefit of the DCD to a purchaser of the site, X. What if Panatown [Ltd] itself was entitled to, and did, sue for and recover damages from McAlpine? Presumably McAlpine could not in addition be liable to X for breach of the DCD: yet Panatown [Ltd] would not be liable to account to X for the damages it had recovered from McAlpine. The result would therefore be another piece of legal nonsense: the party who had suffered real, tangible damage, X, could recover nothing but Panatown [Ltd] which had suffered no real loss could recover damages. Again, suppose that X agrees with McAlpine certain variations of McAlpine\u2019s liability under the building contract. What rights would Panatown then have against McAlpine?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to the minority view in <i>Panatown</i>. Lord\u00a0Goff of Chieveley thought that the rule in <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> was wholly inappropriate to the fact situation at hand. To him, to deny Panatown Ltd a claim to substantial damages would amount to its \u201cperformance or expectation interest\u201d being \u201cinsufficiently protected in law\u201d (as he noted at 546). Accordingly, Lord\u00a0Goff preferred to adopt the broader approach advocated by Lord\u00a0Griffiths in <i>St\u00a0Martins</i>. Lord\u00a0Goff was also of the opinion that the existence of the DCD did not detract from Panatown Ltd\u2019s right to sue for its performance interest. He explained (at 558):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]t is a strange conclusion indeed that the effect of providing a subsidiary remedy for the owner of the land (UIPL), on a restricted basis (breach of a duty of care), is that the building employer, who has furnished the consideration for the building, is excluded from pursuing his remedy in damages under the main contract, which makes elaborate provision, under a standard form specially adapted for this particular development, for the terms upon which the contractor has agreed to design and construct the buildings in question.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The mere fact that the building contractor, McAlpine, has entered into a separate contract in different terms with another party with regard to possible defects in the building which is the subject of the building contract cannot of itself detract from its obligations to the employer under the building contract itself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To Lord\u00a0Goff, the DCD provided only a limited remedy which was subsidiary to that which arose under the main contract. Moreover, he did not think there was really any real risk of double recovery. He gave this example to substantiate his thinking (at 559\u2013560):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Let me take an example. Suppose that a wealthy philanthropist who lives in a village undertakes as an act of charity to renovate the village hall at his own expense. The trustees who own the hall gladly agree that he should do so. A contract is placed by the philanthropist with a builder, and the work is commenced. Unfortunately the work is defective. The builder fails or refuses to rectify the defects; the philanthropist therefore claims damages from him under the building contract, and recovers substantial damages. I cannot believe that, in those circumstances, the philanthropist can simply put the damages in his pocket and leave the building in its defective state. In my opinion, it must be implicit in the licence under which he was permitted to renovate the hall and for that purpose to contract with a builder for the work of renovation that, if the work was begun, he should at least take reasonable steps to procure its satisfactory completion. Accordingly, if he recovers damages from the builder for defective work, he should procure the rectification of the defects by another builder, the damages recovered by him being available to finance that work; though he might, by agreement with the trustees, hand the money over to them to enable them to instruct another builder of their own choice to carry out the necessary remedial work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The other minority law lord in <i>Panatown</i> was Lord\u00a0Millett. He did not dispute that the general rule was that only compensatory damages could be awarded for breach of contract, namely, that only the person who has suffered the loss would be entitled to have it made good by compensation. While recognising that the majority of the House of Lords in <i>St Martins</i> had extended the rule in <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> from contracts for the carriage of goods to contracts for the supply of services, and in particular to building contracts, Lord\u00a0Millett was of the view that there was no justification to extend the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> exception and treat a building employer with no title to the land as contracting on behalf of the owner of the land who, unlike the succeeding owners in the other cases, was identifiable and capable of contracting on his own behalf. Thus, he thought that if the law were to grant substantial damages to such a building employer, it should be under some wider principle, independently of the rule in <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i>. He was therefore inclined to embrace the broad ground advocated by Lord Griffiths in <i>St Martins</i>, that the performance of a contractual obligation had an economic value of its own which was capable of sounding in damages. He cited, <i>inter alia</i>, this illustration to justify his preference for the broad ground (at 588\u2013589):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This is the product of the narrow accountants\u2019 balance sheet quantification of loss which measures the loss suffered by the promisee by the diminution in his overall financial position resulting from the breach. One of the consequences of this approach is to produce an artificial distinction between a contract for the supply of goods to a third party and a contract for the supply of services to a third party. A man who buys a car for his wife is entitled to substantial damages if an inferior car is supplied, on the assumption (not necessarily true) that the property in the car is intended to vest momentarily in him before being transferred to his wife, whereas a man who orders his wife\u2019s car to be repaired is entitled to nominal damages only if the work is imperfectly carried out. This is surely indefensible; the reality of the matter is that in both cases the man is willing to undertake a contractual liability in order to be able to provide a benefit to his wife.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Millett also referred to the case of <i>Radford v De Froberville</i> <nobr>[1977] 1 WLR 1262</nobr> (\u201c<i>Radford</i>\u201d), a decision of Oliver\u00a0J, which he felt was really the seed germinating in the broad ground advanced by Lord Griffiths. In <i>Radford</i>, the landlord of tenanted premises had obtained a covenant from the owner of a neighbouring land to build a garden wall on the neighbour\u2019s side of the boundary. The wall was not built. The landlord sued on the covenant and claimed, as damages, the cost of building a similar wall on his side of the boundary. Oliver\u00a0J, while finding that the absence of the wall had caused no reduction in the landlord\u2019s reversionary interest and that the landlord would derive no direct benefit in having the wall built, nevertheless awarded the landlord the cost of building the wall, as he also found that the landlord intended to apply the damages in building a wall on his side of the boundary in order to provide his tenants with the amenity which the promised wall on the neighbour\u2019s side would have done. In those circumstances, it was reasonable for the landlord to have insisted that the wall be built. Oliver\u00a0J elaborated (at 1270):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Now, it may be that, viewed objectively, it is not to the plaintiff\u2019s financial advantage to be supplied with the article or service which he has stipulated. It may be that another person might say that what the plaintiff has stipulated for will not serve his commercial interests so well as some other scheme or course of action. And that may be quite right. But that, surely, must be for the plaintiff to judge. Pacta sunt servanda. If he contracts for the supply of that which he thinks serves his interests \u2013 be they commercial, aesthetic or merely eccentric \u2013 then if that which is contracted for is not supplied by the other contracting party I do not see why, in principle, he should not be compensated by being provided with the cost of supplying it through someone else or in a different way, subject to the proviso, of course, that he is seeking compensation for a genuine loss and not merely using a technical breach to secure an uncovenanted profit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverting to the facts in <i>Panatown</i>, like Lord\u00a0Goff, Lord\u00a0Millett did not think that the fact that, under the DCD, McAlpine had undertaken a duty of care to UIPL, should deprive Panatown Ltd of its contractual rights. While appreciating that the wider approach would raise the spectre of double recovery, he did not think that such an eventuality, where a breach of a single obligation creates a liability to two different parties, was that exceptional. To overcome what appeared to be a problem, he offered these practical solutions (at 595):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Since performance of the primary obligation to do the work would have discharged the liability to both parties, so must performance of the secondary obligation to pay damages. Payment of damages to either must pro tanto discharge the liability to both. The problem, in my view, is not one of double recovery, but of ensuring that the damages are paid to the right party.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There can be no complaint by the building employer if the damages are recovered by the building owner, since he was the intended beneficiary of the arrangements in the first place. The building employer\u2019s performance interest will be satisfied by carrying out the remedial work or by providing the building owner with the means to pay for it to be done. This provides the key to the proper approach in the converse case like the present where the action is brought by the building employer despite the existence of a cause of action in the building owner. Since the building employer\u2019s expectation loss reflects and cannot exceed the loss suffered by the building owner, and would be satisfied by any award of damages to the latter, his claim should normally be subordinated to any claim made by the building owner. While, therefore, I do not accept that [Panatown Ltd\u2019s] claim to substantial damages is excluded by the existence of the DCD, I think that an action like the present should normally be stayed in order to allow the building owner to bring his own proceedings. The court will need to be satisfied that the building owner is not proposing to make his own claim and is content to allow his claim to be discharged by payment to the building employer before allowing the building employer\u2019s action to proceed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The difference between the majority and the minority approaches in <i>Panatown</i> is of a doctrinal nature. The majority took the view that as the contractual arrangement between the building employer and the builder envisaged and provided for a direct contractual claim by the third party (by way of the DCD) against the builder, it must follow that where the loss was suffered by the third party, the latter should be the person to make the claim. To hold otherwise would run counter to the implicit contractual intention of the building employer and the builder. It is based on what was within the presumed intention of the parties. However, the minority did not think that just because the contractual arrangement envisaged the giving of a contractual right, though limited, to the third party, it must necessarily follow that the primary right of the building employer to obtain relief for breach of the building contract should thereby be curtailed. There was no justification to presume that the rights of the building employer were to be subsumed under or subordinate to those of the third party under the DCD. The building employer should be compensated for what he had paid for but did not receive and the grant of such relief to the building employer would have nothing to do with the exception in <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The foregoing would appear to be the state of the law in England. Before this case, the Singapore courts had no occasion to address the issue as to whether the narrow ground or the broad ground is more correct in principle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appellants\u2019 argument</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants have argued, following the decisions of this court in <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 113</nobr> (\u201c<i>Ocean Front</i>\u201d) and <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers (Raglan Squire &amp; Partners FE) v MCST Plan No\u00a01075</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 449</nobr> (\u201c<i>Eastern Lagoon</i>\u201d), that the MCST in this case would have a direct cause of action in tort against the contractors and professional advisors, and that under neither the narrow ground nor the broad ground was Prosperland entitled to substantial damages. They argued that there was no legal black hole warranting the law granting to a party like Prosperland a cause of action to sue for substantial damages. If there was any breach of duty, the MCST, the real party to suffer the loss, should be the one to sue in tort for the loss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The narrow ground</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will first examine the appellants\u2019 arguments under the narrow ground. Should it follow that, just because the decisions in <i>Ocean Front</i> and <i>Eastern Lagoon</i> permit the MCST to sue Civic and the appellants in tort, Prosperland should thereby be precluded from claiming substantial damages for the defective works? Prakash\u00a0J did not think so. She pointed out that unlike a claim in contract, to succeed in a claim in tort, the claimant must establish negligence on the part of the alleged tortfeasor. Moreover, not all breaches of contract are evidence of negligence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That, of course, is not all. A claim in tort can also be defeated by certain defences, such as, that the work was executed by an independent competent sub-contractor or that the articles were supplied by a reputable manufacturer and the latent defect could not reasonably be discovered by the contractor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While a claim in tort could overlap with that of a claim in contract, it does not follow that they are the same. The difference, in relation to a contract of carriage, was noted by Lord\u00a0Diplock in <i>The Albazero</i>, where he said at 846\u2013847:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The development of the law of negligence since 1839 does not provide a complete substituted remedy for some types of loss caused by breach of a contract of carriage. Late delivery is the most obvious example of these. \u2026 But the rule extends to all forms of carriage including carriage by sea itself where no bill of lading has been issued, and there may still be occasional cases in which the rule would provide a remedy where no other would be available to a person sustaining loss which under a rational legal system ought to be compensated by the person who has caused it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would respectfully agree with Lord\u00a0Diplock that a claim in tort does not provide a complete substituted remedy in a contract of carriage. It does not wholly eliminate the \u201clegal black hole\u201d. That is also the case with regard to a building contract. In tort, one cannot recover damages for delay. As mentioned before, a claim in tort can also be defeated by the defence of independent contractor. Thus, even though Singapore law, unlike English law, allows claims in tort by a management corporation under the Land Titles (Strata) Act for economic losses arising from damage to real property, a legal black hole may still exist.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants sought to rely on a passage in <i>Rolls-Royce Power Engineering plc v Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd</i> [2004] 2\u00a0All ER (Comm) 129 (\u201c<i>Rolls-Royce</i>\u201d) to contend that where the third party could sue in tort, there is no more room for the application of the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> exception. The passage at 172 reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he law does not readily contemplate a situation in which, as a result of a breach committed by A of a term of his contract with B, which term it was envisaged at the time the contract was made was intended, in whole or in part, to benefit C or an identified class of which C was a member, C has suffered a loss, C has no remedy. To avoid the injustice which depriving C of a remedy in that situation would cause the law strives to find a way of navigating round technical rules which would prevent C being compensated. The problem does not arise in tort because it can be avoided by the imposition of a duty of care owed by A to C in an appropriate case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would point out that this passage does not say that because C has a remedy in tort against A, B therefore cannot claim for substantial damages in contract on the basis of the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> exception. The \u201cproblem\u201d referred to in the passage was really the question of privity which would, of course, not arise if the claim was in tort. The passage does in no way suggest that a claim in tort is as good a remedy as a claim in contract. At [33] and [34] above, we have referred to some of the differences between a claim in contract and that in tort. In addition, under a claim in tort, the claimant cannot ask for losses suffered as a result of any delay in the completion of the works; nor for liquidated damages which may have been provided in the building contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is significant to note that Lord\u00a0Diplock in <i>The Albazero</i>, while recognising that the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> exception should not be extended beyond what was justified by its rationale, said that the exception was necessary where \u201cthere was <i>no contact</i> between the carrier and the person who sustained the actual loss\u201d. It seems to us that by \u201cno contact\u201d, Lord\u00a0Diplock was referring to the necessity of the rule where there was no <i>contract</i> between the third party and the party in breach. This is reinforced by the fact that the other examples given by Lord\u00a0Diplock as to when the exception would apply were confined to the situation where there was no <i>contract</i>: see <i>The Albazero</i> at 847\u2013848.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similar views were expressed by Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson in <i>St Martins</i> where he said (at 115):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If, pursuant to the terms of the original building contract, the contractors <i>have undertaken liability to the ultimate purchasers to remedy defects</i> appearing after they acquired the property, it is manifest the case will not fall within the rationale of <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> \u2026 [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Panatown</i>, Lord\u00a0Clyde, in explaining what would preclude the building employer from suing the builder for substantial damages, said at 531:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">But the counterpart in a building contract to a right of suit under a bill of lading should be the provision of a <i>direct entitlement</i> in a third party to sue the contractor in the event of a failure in the contractor\u2019s performance. In the context of a building contract one does not require to look for a second building contract to exclude the exception. It would be sufficient to find <i>the provision</i> of a right to sue. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Panatown</i>, Lord\u00a0Jauncey of Tullichettle also seemed to think that only where a contractual right to sue was available to the third party would <i>The Albazero</i> exception be excluded. He said at 568:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Neither in the speeches of Lord\u00a0Diplock nor of Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson, to which I have referred, is it suggested that the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> rule will only be displaced by rights vested in a third party which are identical to those of the innocent contracting party, indeed Lord\u00a0Diplock, <i>The Albazero</i> <nobr>[1977] AC 774</nobr>, 848C, considered that there were even stronger grounds for not applying the rule to cases where the two sets of contractual rights were different. What is important, as I see it, is that the third party should as a result of the main contract have the right to recover substantial damages for breach under his contract even if those damages may not be identical to those which would have been recovered under the main contract in the same circumstances. In such a situation the need for an exception to the general rule ceases to apply.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the appellants relied on a statement of Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson in <i>St Martins</i> (at 115) where he said that the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> exception provided \u201ca remedy where <i>no other</i> would be available to a person sustaining loss which under a rational legal system ought to be compensated by the person who has caused it\u201d, emphasising in particular the words \u201cno other\u201d. But immediately before this sentence, Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson was referring to the building employer being entitled to <i>enforce contractual rights</i> for the benefit of those who suffered from defective performance but who \u201cunder the terms of the contract, could not acquire any right to hold [the contractor] liable for breach\u201d. It seems to us that Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson had in mind a contractual remedy. When the person who in fact suffers the loss should eventually sue for the loss in tort, he would not be enforcing contractual rights. It would be for the more limited purpose of obtaining damages due to negligence. We would add that the indorsee of a bill of lading, by virtue of the B/L\u00a0Act, steps into the shoes of the consignor and is entitled to sue under the terms of the bill of lading.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Panatown</i>, the majority of the law lords did not think that Panatown Ltd should be permitted to claim for substantial damages because of the existence of the DCD. In the context there, they felt that there was no legal black hole. The parties had addressed the question of UIPL, and its successors, having a remedy against McAlpine, and had expressly provided for it by way of the DCD. As the DCD was an integral part of the contractual arrangement, there was really no room for the application of the <i>Dunlop v Lambert</i> or <i>The Albazero</i> exception.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast, in our present case, there was no such deed emanating from Civic or the appellants in favour of any potential purchasers of the units in the condominium. The fact that under general law, following <i>Ocean Front</i> and <i>Eastern Lagoon</i>, the subsequent purchasers have a limited right to claim in tort against Civic and the appellants, cannot justify the taking away of the contractual rights of the building employer under <i>The Albazero</i> exception. Such a limited right does not remove the legal black hole completely. A claim in tort is not a \u201cprovision of a direct entitlement\u201d and it is subject to establishing proximity and foreseeability and defences such as independent contractors. Thus, we agree with Prakash\u00a0J that the present case falls within the narrow ground of the exception expounded by Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson in <i>St Martins</i> and affirmed by the majority of the House of Lords in <i>Panatown</i>. To deprive a building employer of <i>The Albazero</i> exception, there has to be an express contractual right in favour of a third party or something akin to it, as in the case of an indorsee of a bill of lading under the B/L\u00a0Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we need to briefly address two further questions. The first is the question of double liability. This problem is more apparent than real. On the basis of what Lord\u00a0Diplock said in <i>The</i> <i>Albazero</i> at 844 and what Lord\u00a0Browne-Wilkinson stated in <i>Panatown</i> at 575, Prosperland would have to account to the MCST for the damages recovered by Prosperland from Civic and the appellants. While Prosperland is presently under members\u2019 voluntary liquidation, there was no suggestion that Prosperland did not have sufficient assets to discharge its obligations to its existing creditors as well as the MCST. Mr\u00a0Ng Chee Kheng, the property manager of Prosperland and its main witness at the trial, had said in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that \u201cany [moneys] which the plaintiff may recover from these proceedings would be used to rectify the defects\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second question relates to the argument that as the appellants did not raise the defence of independent contractor in their pleadings, that defence is irrelevant to the action. The short answer is that in relation to the preliminary issue now under consideration, we are concerned with general principles, not with details of pleadings in the case. Moreover, if the MCST were to sue any party in tort, the defence of independent contractor could come into play, depending on the facts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The broad ground</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The foregoing should suffice to dispose of the first issue. Nevertheless, we will now turn to consider the issue under the broad ground. Prakash\u00a0J preferred the broad ground both on principle and logic. She said at [64]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is not, in my view, consistent with logic or principle that a contractor under a building contract, who is fully aware that his acts or defaults can have long-term consequences that only manifest themselves well after the employer has divested himself of his interest in the building project (as all anticipate he will), should be able to avoid his responsibility to fulfil the contractual specifications and to deliver to the employer the performance that the latter has paid for and that the contractor has assured the employer he will be able to undertake and deliver.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Panatown</i>, Lord\u00a0Millett pointed out a number of absurdities if the broad ground were not to be accepted. He said at 586:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Breach of a supply contract involves a failure to provide the very goods or services which the defendant has contracted to supply and for which the plaintiff has paid or agreed to pay. If the breach is discovered before the payment of the contract price, the price is abated by the cost of making good the defects. The right to abatement does not depend upon ownership by the plaintiff of the property, whether goods or land, on which the work was to be carried out; and it would be very odd if the plaintiff\u2019s rights varied according to whether the breach was discovered before or after the payment of the price.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Further down at 591\u2013592, Lord\u00a0Millett added:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[U]nless the law recognises the performance interest[,] it can provide no remedy to the building employer if the contractor repudiates the contract before he has done any work at all, and the building employer has to engage another contractor to do the work at a higher price. This would be manifestly unjust, and to defend it by saying that the loss is suffered by the building owner (who in fact has suffered none) and not by the building employer is nothing short of absurd.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Goff also made a similar comment (at 546), that if it were to be held that the building employer had no performance interest and if the builder were to repudiate the contract or fail to perform, the employer would have no remedy if he were not the owner of the property.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, this is not to say that there will be no difficulties if the broad ground is to be adopted. At [24] above, we have quoted a passage from Lord Browne-Wilkinson\u2019s judgment in <i>Panatown</i> where he gave an illustration of the problems the broad ground could give rise to. It seems to us that most of the problems may not be intractable and may be overcome through the practical solutions suggested by Lord\u00a0Millett quoted at [29] above.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the broad ground is probably more consistent with principle. There is no reason why the employer\u2019s right to sue for his loss should be dependent on whether he is the owner of the property or otherwise. The only problem that could arise, which is more apparent than real, is that the builder could be exposed to double liability. We would reiterate the solutions proffered by Lord\u00a0Millett. We think those solutions meet the \u201cproblem\u201d. The court ought not to deprive a party of his just contractual relief on account of a perceived difficulty which could be easily surmounted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we have discussed above, the basis on which a plaintiff is entitled to claim for substantial damages under the broad ground is that he did not receive what he had bargained and paid for. It has nothing to do with the ownership of the thing or property. As to the value of this performance interest, it seems to us that the observation of Lord\u00a0Scarman in <i>Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd</i> <nobr>[1980] 1 WLR 277</nobr>, that the fact that a contracting party has required services to be supplied at his own cost to a third party is at least <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the value of those services to the party who placed the order, is a useful pointer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neither should the claim be dependent upon whether a third party can sue the party in default in tort. Why should the existence of such a right in a third party to claim in tort affect the contractual rights of the plaintiff? The only thing which the court should guard against is to ensure that the builder is not required to compensate twice over for the same damage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned in [32] above, the main ground upon which the appellants sought to argue that Prosperland could not claim for substantial damages was that, as the MCST was entitled to sue the appellants in tort, there was no legal black hole. It was also pointed out that if Prosperland were to be allowed to claim for substantial damages, it would expose the appellants to double liability. In our opinion, these arguments miss the fundamental premise upon which the broad ground is based. It has nothing to do with the \u201cfilling up\u201d of a legal black hole. We can do no better than quote the following passage of Steyn\u00a0LJ (as he then was) in <i>Darlington Borough Council v Wiltshier Northern Ltd</i> (1994) 69\u00a0BLR 1 at 24:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The rationale of Lord\u00a0Griffiths\u2019 wider principle is essentially that if a party engages a builder to perform specified work, and the builder fails to render the contractual service the employer suffers a loss. He suffers a loss of bargain or of expectation interest. And that loss can be recovered on the basis of what it would cost to put right the defects.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have addressed the question of double liability in relation to the narrow ground. At [29] above, we have quoted what Lord\u00a0Millett said could be the solution. Clearly, if the court, in a particular case, should think it expedient or just, it could always, pursuant to O\u00a015 r\u00a06 of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2004\u00a0Rev Ed), join a third party to the proceedings (see <i>Panatown</i> at 561 and 596 <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Goff and Lord\u00a0Millett respectively).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A related matter raised is whether it must be shown by the building employer that he has already carried out the repairs or intends to do so before he is entitled to claim for substantial damages. On the basis of the broad ground that a plaintiff recovers substantial damages for the loss in not getting what he contracted for, that should not be a prerequisite before such damages may be claimed. If, for example, an owner of a house were to engage a contractor to erect a koi pond and it was so badly done that it was of no use and the owner decided to abandon the project, there is no reason why he must have proceeded with the repairs, or intended so to do, before he may claim for substantial damages. At the end of the day, the entire circumstances of the case must be considered to determine whether the claim made was reasonable or was made with a view to obtaining an uncovenanted benefit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any case, as mentioned earlier, there is evidence that the MCST intended to carry out the repairs and it was also looking towards Prosperland (the developer) for relief. The MCST also expected Prosperland to carry out the rectifications. Moreover, there is evidence that Prosperland intended to use the damages recovered for that purpose. Prosperland and the present owners of the condominium are related.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the premises, we hold that Prosperland is, in principle, entitled to claim for substantial damages pursuant to the broad ground.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Limitation</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to consider the issue as to whether the claim relating to the de-bonding of the wall tiles of the building is time-barred. On this matter, the material facts are these. In August 1997, the building supervisor of the condominium, one Mr\u00a0Law, noticed a wall tile on the fourth storey of the building becoming de-bonded and he duly reported the matter to Prosperland, which in turn notified Civic. Civic had the tile replaced. Thereafter, Mr\u00a0Law did regular visual inspection of the external fa\u00e7ade. Nothing unusual appeared to him. The trial judge found that such steps taken by Prosperland were an adequate response. The next event occurred two years later in August 1999, when Mr\u00a0Law noticed that some tiles at the sixth and seventh storeys of the building had become de-bonded and he again reported the matter. In the next month, September 1999, two tiles fell from the 20th storey. A close range inspection was subsequently carried out and it revealed more de-bonded and uneven tiles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Civic denied liability, a surveyor was engaged to look into the problem. In his report issued in May 2000, the surveyor indicated that the de-bonding was due to poor workmanship and missing or incomplete movement joints. Prosperland instituted the present action in May 2002. The position taken by Prosperland was that the earliest date it could have had knowledge of the seriousness of the defects in the external fa\u00e7ade was in September 1999, when the two tiles had fallen off. Prosperland also contended that, in fact, such knowledge should only be imputed to it when it received the surveyor\u2019s report in May 2000. For this purpose Prosperland relied on the following passage in <i>Nash v Eli Lilly &amp; Co</i> [1993] 4\u00a0All ER 383 at 396:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is to be noted that a firm belief held by the plaintiff that his injury was attributable to the act or omission of the defendant, <i>but in respect of which he thought it necessary to obtain reassurance or confirmation from experts, medical or legal, or others, would not be regarded as knowledge until the result of his inquiries was known to him</i> or, if he delayed in obtaining that confirmation, until the time at which it was reasonable for him to have got it. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the building was completed in May 1993, the normal limitation period for a claim in contract or tort of six years would have expired by May 1999. However, s\u00a024A of the Limitation Act (Cap\u00a0163, 1996\u00a0Rev Ed) postpones the commencement of the limitation period, for actions in respect of latent injury or damage, to the date on which the injured party had knowledge of his rights to bring a claim for the injury or damage. The section also provides that a party\u2019s knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire \u201cfrom facts observable or ascertainable by him\u201d. The injured party will be required to institute the action within three years of such commencement date.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge held that the de-bonding of the single tile in August 1997 would not constitute the requisite knowledge for the purposes of s\u00a024A. She held that Prosperland had acted reasonably in bringing the matter to the attention of Civic, who duly rectified the defect. Accepting the evidence of the experts, she did not think that the fact that Prosperland had knowledge of the de-bonding of just one tile in August 1997 was a sufficient basis to hold that Prosperland had knowledge that there were widespread defects in the bonding of the wall tiles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants have raised the question of law as to the burden of proof in a case where s\u00a024A applies. It seems to us clear that as Prosperland did not bring the action within the period of six years from the completion of the project, the burden was on Prosperland to show that it acquired knowledge of the claim within three years of the date on which the action was, in fact, instituted. In <i>Nash v Eli Lilly &amp; Co</i>, the judge said (at 396):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Finally it is important to remember where the onus of proof lies. <i>If the writ is not issued within three years of the date when the cause of action arose \u2026 the onus is on the plaintiff to plead and prove a date within the three years</i> preceding the date of the issue of the writ \u2026 If the <i>defendant wishes to rely on a date prior to the three year period immediately preceding the issue of the writ, the onus is on the defendant</i> to prove that the plaintiff had or ought to have had knowledge by that date. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the facts of the present case, the central issue turned on the question as to the date on which it would be reasonable to hold that Prosperland had knowledge, or should have known, that there was a serious defect in the bonding of the wall tiles as a whole. The evidence of the experts called by the parties would appear to indicate that when more than one tile had become de-bonded, a reasonable person would have been very concerned and would have conducted a close inspection to determine the state of the bonding of the tiles surrounding the de-bonded tiles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence relating to the discovery of the de-bonded tiles, as well as that given by the experts called by the parties, was carefully considered and evaluated by the trial judge at [14] to [38] of her judgment and she concluded at [39] as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In my view, the first time that Prosperland had knowledge that the problem with the wall tiles was not an isolated one was in September 1999 when two tiles de-bonded and fell off. This has been established on the balance of probabilities and the defendants have not convinced me that Prosperland had the requisite knowledge of the defects before May 1999.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contrary to the assertion by the appellants, the trial judge had not wrongly applied the burden of proof. It was for Prosperland to prove it acquired the relevant knowledge on or after May 1999. It would be for the appellants to show knowledge on the part of Prosperland on an earlier date. Prosperland could not be expected to prove a negative.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have only one minor qualification to the conclusion reached by the trial judge. While we agree that she was amply justified to hold, in the light of the evidence of the experts, that the de-bonding of one tile in August 1997 was an isolated incident which would not have warranted the taking of further actions to examine at close range the entire fa\u00e7ade of the building, other than stepping up periodic visual inspections of the fa\u00e7ade (which were in fact carried out by Mr\u00a0Law), the emergence of the de-bonding of more tiles at the sixth and seventh storeys of the building in August 1999 should have sounded the alarm and alerted Prosperland that there was something seriously amiss with regard to the wall tiles. The falling of two tiles in September 1999 would have provided the further confirmation that the problem was no longer an isolated one. Perhaps, the trial judge did not think that in reality it made any real difference as August 1999 was still within the period of three years before May 2002. Moreover, that was how the issue was framed for her to determine, namely, whether Prosperland had the requisite knowledge \u201cwithin the period of three years prior to the date\u201d of the action. However, strictly on the evidence, and particularly that of the experts, we would have thought that the date from which knowledge should be imputed to Prosperland was August 1999 rather than September 1999.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, there are two other aspects which we must touch on. First, on the evidence, it is clear that the de-bonding of a tile does not take place overnight. It is a slow process. However, this is not the material consideration. The critical question is, from which date would it be reasonable to hold that Prosperland knew or ought to have known that there was a widespread problem of de-bonding in relation to the wall tile of the fa\u00e7ade of the building. Mr\u00a0Law undertook regular visual inspection of the fa\u00e7ade. The trial judge accepted that it was only in August 1999 that more de-bonded tiles were observed by Mr\u00a0Law. The fact that the process of the de-bonding of a tile has commenced does not necessarily mean that it would be noted or observed from a distance with the human eye.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, the appellants placed much emphasis on a photograph which was tendered to court to show de-bonding of certain wall tiles between the sixth and seventh storeys. The photograph itself did not indicate a date. However, below the photograph were written the words \u201cphotograph taken on 24\u00a0June 1999\u201d. It was not absolutely clear who wrote those words though Mr\u00a0Ng Chee Kheng said that it could be him. He added that he got the date from Law but Law denied giving it to him. It was also not known who took the photograph. Be that as it may, the trial judge did not take this photograph into account in determining when de-bonding of more wall tiles was noticed by Law, who was the person charged by Prosperland to periodically inspect the external fa\u00e7ade to detect the de-bonding of wall tiles. As the finding of the judge, that the de-bonding of more tiles did not occur before May 1999, is a finding of fact based on the evidence of witnesses, we are unable to say that it is plainly wrong and warranting our overturning it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, we would affirm the answers given by Prakash\u00a0J to the two preliminary issues of law set out in [9] above. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed with costs, with the usual consequential orders.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This question in turn rests upon the question whether two documents emanating from the respondent constitute \"acknowledgment\u2019 within the meaning of s 27 of the Limitation Act (the Act).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><b>The background</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">2 The appellant, Chuan &amp; Company Pte Ltd (Chuan), is a family company, now under voluntary liquidation. It was formed by one Ong Toh. Before its incorporation, it was run by him as a sole proprietorship for some twenty years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">3 Ong Toh passed away on 30 March 1995 and the respondent, Ong Soon Huat, a nephew of his, is the executor of his estate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">4 During his lifetime, Ong Toh dealt with the assets of Chuan as if they were his own. Even after he had on 26 November 1990 transferred all his shares in Chuan to his two daughters (Ms Ong Kim Hong and Ms Ong Thian Hong) by his third wife, and had ceased to be a director, he continued to treat the property of Chuan in any way he pleased. He simply withdrew money from Chuan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">5 From 1987, Ong Toh would acknowledge the moneys taken by him from Chuan by signing on the yearly confirmation of debts statements sent to him by the company auditors, Chan Hock Seng &amp; Company. The last statement of debts was signed by him on 10 March 1994, where he acknowledged owing Chuan the sum of $7,164,304.64. This is the sum which the liquidator of Chuan is seeking to claim back from the estate of Ong Toh in this action.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">6 On 9 December 1995, the executor filed an estate duty affidavit with the Estate Duty Department (EDD) in which the said sum was included as a debt owed by the estate to Chuan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">7 On 17 January 2001, pursuant to a request of EDD, the executor\u2019s solicitors wrote to Chuan\u2019s auditors asking for copies of documents relating to the alleged debt. The relevant parts of the letter read:-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">2.

Without such documents, the Commissioner will refuse to make a deduction for the alleged debts. In the circumstances, please let us have copies of all the documents substantiating the alleged debts\u2026</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1-FirstPara\" align=\"justify\">The documents requested in the letter were duly furnished by Chuan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><b>Decision below</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">8 At the request of the parties, the court below decided, before commencing trial, to determine the question as to whether the claim by Chuan had become time-barred as a preliminary question. The judge ruled that the claim was barred by limitation on 10 March 2000, six years from the date Ong Toh signed the last statement of debts. She held that neither the estate duty affidavit nor the letter of 17 January 2001 constituted an acknowledgement of a debt within the meaning of s 27 of the Limitation Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><b>The statutory provisions</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">9 Section 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act provides that an action founded on a contract or on tort \"shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.\" However, s 26(2) provides that where the person liable for any debt \"acknowledges the claim or makes any payment in respect thereof\" the right of action to recover the debt shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the acknowledgement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">10 What would constitute an acknowledgement is prescribed in s 27, and as this question is central to the issue before us, we shall set out the provisions in full:-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">27(1) Every such acknowledgment as is referred to in section 26 shall be in writing and signed by the person making the acknowledgment.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">(2) Any such acknowledgment or payment as is referred to in section 26 may be made by the agent of the person by whom it is required to be made under that section, and shall be made to the person, or to an agent of the person, whose title or claim is being acknowledged or, as the case may be, in respect of whose claim the payment is being made.</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><b>Estate duty affidavit</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">11 We shall first examine the estate duty affidavit. In the schedule to the affidavit filed by Ong Soon Huat, the sum of $7,164,304.64 was listed as a debt owing by Ong Toh to Chuan. What needs to be determined is whether the affidavit can be considered to be an acknowledgment of the debt \"made to (Chuan) or to an agent of (Chuan)\" within the meaning of s 27(2).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">12 Chuan accepts that to constitute an \"acknowledgment\" there must be a clear admission of liability. Relying upon <i>Bank of America National Trust Savings Association v Cheong Hoon Choy</i> <nobr>[1982] SLR 60</nobr><i>,</i> Chuan argues that it does not matter that the affidavit was not, according to its terms, expressly or impliedly, addressed to Chuan, so long as it was \"delivered to the creditor or his agent by or with the authority of the debtor or his agent.\" The fact that the acknowledgment was addressed to a third party, the Commissioner of Estate Duties, instead of Chuan, is not necessarily an impediment to it being an effective acknowledgment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">13 In <i>Bank of America National Trust Savings Association v Cheong Hoon Choy</i>, the defendant executed a charge over a property owned by him and another person, who had become a bankrupt, to secure overdraft and other facilities granted to that other person. In May 1973, the Official Assignee at Kuala Lumpur paid, on behalf of the defendant and the bankrupt, the sum of M$140,000 to the plaintiffs on the understanding that the charge executed by the defendant would be released. Later the plaintiff claimed the balance sum of M$70,454.43 from the defendant. One of the defences raised was that the claim was time-barred. In response, the plaintiff averred that there was an acknowledgement of the debt by the defendant in April 1973 when the defendant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Official Assignee. The relevant part of the letter read:-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">The aforesaid land is charged in favour of Bank of America \u2026 and the amount outstanding to-date is $206,029.69. We understand that you are in the process of selling the said bankrupt\u2019s half share in the said land for redemption of the said charge.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">Kindly withhold further action in the proposed sale as our client is able to obtain a better offer \u2026</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1-FirstPara\" align=\"justify\">It is significant to note that this letter was specifically copied to and was received by the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors in Kuala Lumpur.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">14 There, it was contended that the letter did not amount to an acknowledgement under s 27(2) because it was not addressed to the plaintiff or its agent, and the Official Assignee was not an agent of the Bank. However, as the letter had expressly acknowledged the debt, and a copy of the letter was sent to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, the court held that the letter would constitute a sufficient acknowledgement for the purpose of s 27(2).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">15 In coming to its decision, the court there had relied on the English case of <i>Re Compania de Electricidad de la Provincia De Buenos Aires Ltd</i> <nobr>[1980] CH 146</nobr> where Slade J, after noting that there did not appear to be any authority on the meaning of the expression \"made to the person, or to an agent of the person, whose title or claim is being acknowledged\", enunciated the following proposition (at 193):-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">.. a written acknowledgment cannot be said to be \"made to\" a creditor or his agent, within the meaning of section 24(2) unless either (a) it is delivered to the creditor or his agent by or with the authority of the debtor or his agent or (b) it is expressly or implicitly addressed to and is actually received by the creditor or his agent.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">In my judgment, in case (a) it would not matter that the acknowledgment was not, according to its terms, expressly or implicitly addressed to the recipient. In case (b) it would not matter that the acknowledgment reached the hands of the creditor otherwise than by or with the authority of the debtor. In either case, however, it would be necessary that the creditor should actually receive the acknowledgment before he could rely on it.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">A company\u2019s balance sheet must in my judgment be regarded as implicitly addressed to (among other persons) those creditors whose debts are referred to in it. It follows that in my judgment, as Miss Arden submitted, and, as I understood him, Mr Sykes did not contend to the contrary, an effective \"acknowledgment\" of a debt must be said to have been \"made\" by the company to any creditor who can establish by appropriate evidence that (i) he has actually received, from whatever source, a copy of a balance sheet of the company, signed by directors of the company and referring to \"sundry creditors\"; (ii) he is one of the \"sundry creditors\" so referred to. In such circumstances the balance sheet of the company would constitute an effective acknowledgment of the relevant debt, not as at the date on which it was actually signed by the directors or received by the creditor, but as at the date of the balance sheet, being the date to which the signature of the directors related; and the cause of action would be deemed to have accrued at that date:\u2026</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">16 However, the fact situation in the present case is not the same as that in <i>Cheong Hoon Choy</i>, where the letter in question was copied to the creditor\u2019s solicitors and was in fact received. Here, the estate duty affidavit was not \"made to\" Chuan or its solicitors. It was addressed to the Commissioner of Estate Duties. It was never received by Chuan or its solicitors. The executor even refused to give a copy of it to Chuan\u2019s solicitors when requested. Chuan only secured a copy by virtue of an order of court obtained in the present action. Such a delivery, by compulsion of an order of court, can hardly suffice to constitute an acknowledgment. It would be noted from the dicta of Slade J, that to constitute an acknowledgment, there must be some intention to convey the contents of the document to the creditor or his agents. Under the first category of delivery enunciated by Slade J, the delivery to the creditor is deliberate. Under the second category, it is implied. Chuan can hardly claim to have relied on a document which it had never seen before the commencement of the action.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">17 Moreover, in <i>Bowring-Hanbury\u2019s Estate v Bowring Hanbury</i> [1943] 1 All ER 48, Bennett J held that the admission of a debt contained in an affidavit relating to the estate of a deceased person sworn for probate purposes could not constitute a sufficient acknowledgment since it was made to the probate court and not to the creditor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">18 We accept the argument of Chuan that if an affidavit, though by its terms not addressed to the creditor, is nevertheless sent by the debtor to the creditor, that could amount to an effective acknowledgment of the debt. This would fall within the first category of delivery enunciated by Slade J. It seems clear to us that the concept of \"acknowledgment\" within the meaning of the Limitation Act envisages a voluntary desire to admit a debt. Otherwise, it would mean that a letter written to a complete third party, admitting to a debt to the creditor, would amount to an acknowledgement of the debt to the creditor if the latter should somehow come into possession of it. An acknowledgement to make time run afresh in respect of a claim, or to revive a time-barred claim, cannot be obtained by way of a sidewind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">19 Thus, it is our opinion that the first ground raised by Chuan to defeat the defence of time-bar must fail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><b>Letter of 17 January 2001</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">20 We now turn to examine the second document, i.e., letter of 17 January 2001. We have in \u00b67 above set out the pertinent parts of the letter which Chuan asserts contained an acknowledgment of the debt. As this document was addressed to Chuan\u2019s auditors, Chan Hock Seng &amp; Co, it is just as good as being made to Chuan. What is left to be considered is whether there was an acknowledgment of the debt in the letter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">21 Counsel for Chuan argued that the court below had taken too narrow a view of the document when it held that the letter did not contain an acknowledgment of the debt and that it only contained an allegation by Chuan that Ong Toh owed Chuan the sum of $7,164,304.64. He further argued that the letter should be read together with the estate duty affidavit; the context is all important. It would be fair to assume that the Commissioner of Estate Duty had asked for documentary proof of the debt because the respondent, the executor of the estate of Ong Toh, must have stated in the affidavit that the estate owed Chuan the said sum. Counsel also contended that the words \"Chuan &amp; Co Pte Ltd\u2019s allegation\" appearing in the letter should be construed as referring to the Commissioner\u2019s query on the respondent\u2019s admission of debt to Chuan set out in the affidavit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><i>22 Good v Parry</i>\u00a0[1963] 2 All ER 59 is a case where the English Court of Appeal had the opportunity to consider s 23(4) of the <i>English Limitation Act 1939</i> [which is in <i>pari materia</i> with our s 27(2)] and where it held that, unlike the previous law, for a document to constitute an acknowledgment, there need not be an express or implied promise to pay. But there must, nevertheless, be a clear acknowledgment of a debt or other liquidated damage, although the specific sum was not stated. In the latter event, reference could be made to extrinsic evidence to ascertain the amount. Lord Denning MR explained that (at 61):-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">\u2026 the debt must be quantified in figures or, at all events, it must be liquidated in this sense that it is capable of ascertainment by calculation, or by extrinsic evidence, without further agreement of the parties.</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">23 In <i>Good v Parry</i> the court held that the sentence, \"The question of outstanding rent can be settled as a separate agreement as soon as you present your account\" did not acknowledge any debt as due. It merely acknowledged that there might be a claim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">24 In contrast, in <i>Dungate v Dungate</i> [1965] 3 All ER 818, a certain G, took several loans from his brother, the plaintiff. On 23 February 1962, G wrote a letter to the plaintiff containing the sentence, \"Keep a check on totals and amounts I owe you and we will have account now and then.\" The English Court of Appeal held that this letter was a clear acknowledgment of a debt due to the plaintiff. In Diplock LJ\u2019s view, the letter in question \"made it quite plain that there were amounts owing and outstanding.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">25 A third case, <i>Kamouh v Associated Electrical Industries International Ltd &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1979] 2 WLR 795</nobr>, is also highly illustrative. There, the plaintiff\u2019s brother had in April 1967 procured a contract for the defendants and had incurred expenses in connection therewith. The next month, May 1967, the first defendants in a letter to the brother stated that they recognised that he was in effect out of pocket to the extent of \u00a3100,000 for those activities. In reply to a letter from him, the defendants wrote in March 1970 to deny that there was any agreement to pay him remuneration and added:-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">Turning now to your out-of-pocket expenses, you will appreciate that you have had substantial payments on account although I understand that so far no detail or corroborative evidence has been produced by you. You will appreciate that it is quite impossible for this company to make any further payment to you in respect of your disbursements without a detailed account supported by appropriate and acceptable evidence of payment. If you will provide the required information it will have early consideration.</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">26 We should mention that the plaintiff in <i>Kamouh</i> commenced the action in a representative capacity. Parker J held that the above paragraph could not amount to an acknowledgment. All it meant was \"we do not admit that you were entitled to even that which you have already been paid. Before you can have anything more, you will have to show that that and more was due.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">27 The plaintiff there sought to argue that this letter of March 1970 should be read together with the letter of May 1967. While Parker J accepted that the letter in question should properly be read in its context, and, for that purpose, reference could be made to the earlier letters, including that of May 1967, he nevertheless held that the letter of March 1970 could not be viewed to be an acknowledgment, as it did not admit that any sum was due to the plaintiff\u2019s brother as expenses. It was no more than an acknowledgment that there might be something owing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">28 It is of interest to note that in <i>Agricultural</i> <i>Mortgage Corporation v Williams &amp; Ors</i>, a decision of the English Court of Appeal of 15 May 1995, the court affirmed the principle that in determining whether a letter constituted an acknowledgment earlier correspondence could be looked into. In that case the defendants argued that if the earlier correspondence was taken into account, it would be seen that there was no intention to acknowledge the title of the plaintiffs as mortgagees. However, the court held that the expression \"they are amply secured\" in the letter in question clearly suggested that the plaintiffs were secured as mortgagees under the mortgage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">29 In our view, the rules governing the construction of a document to determine whether it constitutes an acknowledgment should be no different from those applicable to the construction of other documents. Their ultimate object is to determine the intention of the maker in the light of the words he has used. Where the words in a document are clear, it is not permissible to refer to extrinsic material and give them a meaning which is at variance with the express words. It is only where the words used in a document are ambiguous that extrinsic material may be referred to to assist in determining the intended meaning. But where, as in <i>Agricultural Mortgage Corporation</i> and <i>Dungate v Dungate</i>, and particularly in the present case, the express words are clear, the court should not rewrite the document into something it is not. Here, the letter in question referred to Chuan\u2019s \"allegation\" of a debt and asked Chuan for documents \"substantiating the alleged debts\". We are unable to read this letter as amounting to an acknowledgment of a debt. To do so would do violence to the plain words of the document.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><b>Existing debt</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">30 Before we conclude we would like to refer to a statement made by the judge below which requires clarification. It reads:-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">The law requires there to be \u2018an unequivocal admission of a subsisting debt, that is subsisting at the time of the acknowledgment\u2019 (per Lord Evershed at p. 482 of <i>Consolidated Agencies Ltd v Bertram Ltd</i> <nobr>[1956] AC 470</nobr> quoted with approval by the Malaysian Federal Court in <i>Wee Tiang Teng v Ong Chong Hooi</i> <nobr>[1978] 2 MLJ 54</nobr> at 56). It is noteworthy that as at 17 January 2001, the debt was already time-barred, it no longer subsisted.</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">31 It seems to us that the judge thought that where limitation has set in, a debt could not be revived by a subsequent acknowledgment. In coming to that view the judge relied upon the Malaysian Federal Court case of <i>Wee Tiang Teng v Ong Chong Hooi &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1978] 2 MLJ 54</nobr> which in turn relied upon the Privy Council decision in <i>Consolidated Agencies Ltd v Bertram Ltd</i> <nobr>[1956] AC 470</nobr>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">32 What seems to have been overlooked is that the applicable statutory provision (s 19 of the Indian Limitation Act) in the <i>Bertram</i> case is quite different from s 26(2) of our Act. There, the provision read:-</p>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font size=\"4\"><em>Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed for a suit or application in respect of any property or right</em>, an acknowledgment of liability in respect of such property or right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such property or right is claimed, or by some person through whom he derives title or liability, a fresh period of limitation shall be computed from the time when the acknowledgment was so signed. [Emphasis added].</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">33 Our section 26(2) reads:-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" align=\"justify\"><font size=\"4\">Where any right of action has accrued to recover any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim, or any claim to the personal estate of a deceased person or to any share or interest therein, and the person liable or accountable therefor acknowledges the claim or makes any payment in respect thereof, the right shall be deemed to have accrued on and not before the date of the acknowledgment or the last payment.</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">34 While the Malaysian limitation provision was very similar to ours, the fact of the matter was that in <i>Wee Tiang Teng v Ong Chong Hooi</i> the acknowledgment in question was given before the limitation period had expired. So there the question whether a time-barred claim could be revived by subsequent acknowledgment did not arise for consideration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">35 Moreover, the position in Singapore on this point is made all the clearer by s 28(5) of the Act, which reads:-</p>\n\n<blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><font size=\"4\"><em>An acknowledgment made after the expiration of the period of limitation</em>\u00a0prescribed for the bringing of an action to recover the debt or other claim shall not bind any successor on whom the liability devolves on the determination of a preceding estate or interest in property under a settlement taking effect before the date of the acknowledgment. [Emphasis added].</font></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1-FirstPara\" align=\"justify\">There is also a corresponding provision in s 28(7) where part payment of the debt is made after the expiry of the limitation period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">36 Under our statutory scheme, where the limitation period has expired, what it means is that the debt is irrecoverable. If the debtor is sued, he may plead the defence of limitation. However, this defence must be expressly pleaded: see s 4 of the Act, O 18 r 18(1) of the Rules of Court and the House of Lords\u2019 decision in <i>Ketteman v Hansel Properties</i> <nobr>[1987] AC 189</nobr> at 219. Thus, a judgment may be entered on such a claim unless the debtor raises the limitation defence. A judgment may also be entered if there is a subsequent acknowledgment of the debt. Therefore, our scheme of things does not render a debt which is time-barred non-existent; it only renders the debt irrecoverable if limitation is pleaded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><b>Judgment</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">37 Notwithstanding the erroneous view of the judge below on the abovementioned point, the present appeal must still be dismissed as neither the estate duty affidavit nor the letter of 17 January 2001 is an acknowledgment within the meaning of s 27(1) and (2) of the Act. The respondent shall have the costs of this appeal. The security for costs, together with any accrued interest, shall be released to the respondent\u2019s solicitors to account of costs.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Tan Chiang\n\n  informed PPH on 26 Dec 2001 of their intention to appeal, and on 31 Dec 2001 they filed\n\n  their notice of appeal against part of the judgment. However, the notice was not served on\n\n  PPH until 11 Jan 2002. Subsequently, on 25 Jan 2002, PPH notified Tan Chiang that the\n\n  notice of appeal was not validly filed and asked them to rectify the same. As Tan Chiang\n\n  disagreed, PPH filed Motion No. 3 of 2002/D on 2 Feb 2002 to set aside the notice of\n\n  appeal on two broad grounds: first, that leave to appeal should have been obtained as\n\n  required under s 34(2)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap.\n\n  322)(\u2018SCJA\u2019); and second, that the notice of appeal was not served on PPH within\n\n  the period of one month from the date of the judgment as prescribed under O 57 r 4 of the\n\n  Rules of Court. </p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Rajendran J, who heard Motion No. 3/2002/D on 15 Feb 2002 as a single\n\n  judge of the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 36(1) SCJA, was inclined to grant an extension\n\n  of time to serve the notice of appeal on PPH. Nevertheless, he struck out the notice filed\n\n  on 31 Dec 2001 on the ground that it was necessary for Tan Chiang to have first obtained\n\n  leave of court before any notice of appeal could be filed. He ruled that such leave was\n\n  required under s 34(2)(a) SCJA because the value of the subject matter was less than\n\n  $250,000. Although it was not in dispute that the amount of Tan Chiang\u2019s claim at the\n\n  trial well exceeded $250,000, the contention was that they had only appealed against,\n\n  firstly, a part of the claim in which they had not succeeded, and secondly, PPH\u2019s\n\n  counterclaim awarded against Tan Chiang, and the total of these two items did not exceed\n\n  $250,000.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Tan Chiang filed the present Motion No. 8 of 2002/A to ask the Court of\n\n  Appeal to review and set aside the ruling made by Rajendran J on Motion No. 3/2002/D. The\n\n  substantive issue concerned the interpretation of s 34(2)(a) SCJA.<b/></p>\n\n  \n\n\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Held, </p></b>allowing the application:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>(1) A single judge did not have the jurisdiction under s 36(1) SCJA to set aside a\n\n  notice of appeal and correspondingly to strike out an appeal. The orders that could be\n\n  made under s36(1)(i) and (ii) were premised on the existence of an appeal and the need for\n\n  certain interim orders or directions to safeguard the interest of the parties pending\n\n  disposal of the appeal.

All that the court decided was that the word \u2018trial\u2019 should not be read to\n\n  mean only a \"hearing in open court with the calling of witnesses\". There could\n\n  be a \u2018trial\u2019 when the \u2018hearing\u2019 was based purely on affidavits.\n\n  Nothing in Spandeck Engineering suggested that the words \"at the trial\" in s\n\n  34(2)(a) SCJA should be read to mean \"at the appeal\".

The substantive issue\n\nin question concerned the interpretation of s 34(2)(a) of the SCJA. At the conclusion of\n\nthe hearing we set aside the ruling of the Judge and now give our reasons.\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nThe background</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By three separate contracts, Tan Chiang were engaged by the\n\nrespondents, Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd (PPH), as sub-contractors to carry out\n\nworks in relation to three projects namely, the Cuppage Centre project, the Goldbell Tower\n\nProject and the China Square project. Tan Chiang instituted Suit No 14/2001/D against PPH\n\nfor the balance of the payments due under the three projects.</p>\n\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PPH did not dispute the claim of Tan Chiang in relation to the\n\nGoldbell Tower and China Square projects. In essence, what was in dispute concerned 46\n\nitems of variation works undertaken by Tan Chiang in relation to the Cuppage Centre\n\nproject. Eventually, on account of amendments made to the pleadings, the dispute was\n\nreduced to 36 items. On 33 of the items, PPH disputed only the quantum thereof. But in\n\nrespect of the remaining 3 items, PPH disputed both liability and quantum.</p>\n\n<p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should add that PPH had also counterclaimed against Tan Chiang\n\nin respect of the work done on the Cuppage Centre and the Goldbell Tower projects.</p>\n\n<p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After a 5-day trial, Lai Siu Chiu J delivered her judgment on 30\n\nNovember 2001. On 31 December 2001 Tan Chiang filed their notice of appeal against part of\n\nthe judgment, having on 26 December 2001 informed PPH of their intention to appeal.\n\nHowever, the notice was not served on PPH until 11 January 2002. Subsequently, on 25\n\nJanuary 2002, PPH notified Tan Chiang that the notice of appeal filed was not valid and\n\nasked Tan Chiang to rectify the same. As Tan Chiang disagreed, PPH, on 2 February 2002,\n\nfiled a Motion (No. 3 of 2002/D) to set aside the notice of appeal on two broad grounds: \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) leave to appeal should have been obtained as required under s\n\n  34(2)(a) of SCJA; and, </p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(ii) that the notice of appeal was not served on PPH within the period\n\n  of one month from the date of the judgment as prescribed under O 57 r 4 of the Rules of\n\n  Court.</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Motion No 3/2002/D came before Rajendran J on 15 February 2002,\n\nsitting as a single Judge of the Court of Appeal under s 36(1) of SCJA. Though he was\n\ninclined to grant an extension of time to serve the notice of appeal on PPH, he\n\nnevertheless struck out the notice filed on 31 December 2001 on the ground that it was\n\nnecessary for Tan Chiang to have first obtained the leave of court before any notice of\n\nappeal could be filed. He ruled that such leave was required because the value of the\n\nsubject matter of the appeal was less than $250,000.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nPreliminary issues</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us counsel for Tan Chiang submitted that a single Judge has\n\nthe jurisdiction under s 36(1) of the SCJA to set aside a notice of appeal and\n\ncorrespondingly strike out an appeal. Section 36(1) and (3) provides as follows:- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"(1) In any proceedings pending before the Court of Appeal any\n\n  direction incidental thereto not involving the decision of the appeal, any interim order\n\n  to prevent prejudice to the claims of the parties pending the appeal, and any order for\n\n  security for costs and for the dismissal of an appeal for default in furnishing security\n\n  so ordered, may at any time be made by a Judge.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(3) Every order so made may be discharged or varied by the Court of\n\n  Appeal.\"</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for PPH did not disagree that a single Judge has the\n\njurisdiction to make such an order. After all, it was PPH who asked the single Judge to\n\nmake the order. It would lie ill in the mouth of PPH to contend otherwise. If a single\n\nJudge does have the power under s 36(1) to make such an order, this Court would, under s\n\n36(3), have the power to set it aside or vary it. Both parties went before Rajendran J\n\nassuming that he had the jurisdiction to consider and, if thought appropriate, grant the\n\napplication. Thus, the Judge\u2019s attention was not drawn to the issue of the extent of\n\nhis power. </p>\n\n<p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we had serious reservations whether such an order may be\n\nmade by a single Judge pursuant to s 36(1). There are three broad categories of orders\n\nwhich a single Judge may make under that provision: \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) any incidental direction;</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(ii) any interim order to prevent prejudice; and </p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(iii) any order for security for costs and the consequential order for\n\n  dismissal of appeal for default. </p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Quite clearly, the present case does not come within the third\n\ncategory. The question is whether the order made falls within the first two categories. As\n\nwe see it, the order made on 15 February 2002 could hardly be considered to fall within\n\nthose two categories. The orders to be made under both categories are premised on the\n\nexistence of an appeal and the need for certain interim orders or directions to safeguard\n\nthe interest of the parties pending the disposal of the appeal. An application to strike\n\nout an appeal can, in no circumstances, be considered to be an order of that interlocutory\n\nnature. Indeed, it is an application with the object of putting an end to an appeal and\n\nnot to obtain any interlocutory or further reliefs. Accordingly, it was and is our opinion\n\nthat such an application cannot be heard by a single Judge pursuant to s 36(1).</p>\n\n<p>10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverting to the matter in hand, we would add that whichever way\n\none may determine the jurisdictional issue of the single Judge under s 36(1), this Court\n\nwas properly seized of the matter. If, as we thought, a single Judge has no jurisdiction\n\nto order the setting aside and striking out of an appeal then the order of the single\n\nJudge made on 15 February 2002 in N/M No. 3/2002/D was not valid and could have no effect.\n\nThus, this Court could deal with the issues raised in N/M No. 8/2002/A as if the order\n\nmade in N/M No 3/2002/D had never been made.</p>\n\n<p>11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, if we assumed that the single Judge could make\n\nthe order as he actually did in N/M No. 3/2002/D, then by virtue of s 36(3), this Court\n\nwould have the power to review the order made by the Judge. Such an application to the\n\ncourt for a review is not an appeal: see <i>Boyd v Bischoffsheim</i> [1895] 1 Ch 1.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nSection 34(2)(a) of SCJA</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to consider section 34(2)(a) which provides that\n\nwhere \"the amount or value of the subject matter at the trial is $250,000 or\n\nless\" no appeal will be brought to the Court of Appeal except with the leave of the\n\nCourt of Appeal or a Judge. It will be seen that this operates as a restriction on the\n\nright of appeal from a decision of the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions of the High Court can either be in relation to an\n\naction commenced in the High Court or in relation to an action commenced in the\n\nSubordinate Courts which comes on appeal before the High Court. The jurisdictional limits\n\nof the District Court is $250,000 or less. A claim exceeding that limit must be commenced\n\nin the High Court. Implicit in the scheme of things is that there should, as a rule, be\n\nonly one-tier of appeal. In 1998, when the figure in s 34(2)(a) of SCJA was raised to make\n\nit fall in line with the enhanced civil jurisdiction of the District Court, the Minister\n\nof Law, Prof S Jayakumar, in his second reading speech in Parliament when moving an\n\namendment Bill to the SCJA, said: \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"In view of the enhanced District Courts\u2019 jurisdiction to\n\n  $250,000 in civil matters, the Chief Justice has proposed that the existing $30,000 limit\n\n  in section 34(2)(a) be raised to $250,000. In other words, bring its limit in line with\n\n  the enhancement. If the limit is not raised to $250,000, District Court cases of less than\n\n  $250,000 can first go on appeal to the High Court and then Court of Appeal. This would\n\n  strain the limited resources of the Court of Appeal.\"</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, it was not in dispute that the amount of Tan\n\nChiang\u2019s claim at the trial well exceeded $250,000. The contention of PPH was that as\n\nTan Chiang had only appealed against (i) a part of the claim which they had not succeeded;\n\nand (ii) the counterclaim of PPH awarded against them, and as the total of these two items\n\ndid not exceed $250,000, Tan Chiang must, as required under s 34(2)(a), first have\n\nobtained leave before they could proceed to file their notice of appeal.</p>\n\n<p>15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PPH also relied upon the views expressed by the High Court in the\n\nunreported decision of <i>Twin Enterprises Pte Ltd v Peter Lim Heng Wah </i>(S 1712/94\n\n\u2013 delivered on 29 November 2000) where the judge said:\u2013 \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Although the said section (s 34(2)(a)) bespeaks the value of\n\n  subject matter at the trial, it is also intended to refer to the amount of the subject\n\n  matter on appeal.\"</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It seems to us that the arguments raised by counsel for PPH could\n\nbe due to a misunderstanding of the decision of this Court in <i>Spandeck Engineering (S)\n\nPte Ltd v Yong Qiang Construction</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49525&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 4 SLR 401</a>. In 30 of PPH\u2019s written\n\nsubmission they stated \u2013 \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"this Court has in <i>(Spendeck)</i> construed the term\n\n  \u2018amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter\u2019 in s.21(1) of the SCJA to\n\n  mean the amount in dispute or the value of the subject or matter against which the appeal\n\n  was brought.\"</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will deal with the <i>Spendeck Engineering</i> case in some\n\ndetail. There, a sub-contractor instituted a writ in the District Court claiming a sum of\n\n$62,275.51 from the main contractor. Judgment was entered against the main contractor in\n\ndefault of defence. Later, the main contractor filed an application to set aside the\n\ndefault judgment. The Deputy Registrar granted the application. On appeal, the District\n\nJudge reinstated the default judgment. On further appeal, the High Court affirmed the\n\ndecision of the District Judge. The main contractor appealed to the Court of Appeal. This\n\nCourt granted the sub-contractor\u2019s application to strike out the appeal.</p>\n\n<p>18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the main contractor argued that s 34(2)(a) only\n\napplied where there was a trial below. As in that case there was no trial, the provision\n\ncould have no application. This Court ruled that a \"trial\" did not necessarily\n\ninvolve the calling of witnesses and the taking of oral evidence. A trial could be based\n\non the evidence given in affidavits. This court ruled that if the main contractor\u2019s\n\narguments were to be accepted it would lead to anomalous results and gave this\n\nillustration (at p. 404):- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"For instance, an interlocutory or final judgment is given in the\n\n  District Court (in which there has not been a trial) in a suit in which the value of the\n\n  subject matter exceeds $50,000 but not $250,000, as in the present case. From such\n\n  judgment, whether it be interlocutory or final, an appeal may be taken to the High Court\n\n  as of right. Now, if the appellants\u2019 contention is accepted, the decision of the High\n\n  Court on that appeal may be taken further on appeal, as of right, to this Court (without\n\n  leave) on the ground that s 34(2)(a) of the SCJA is not applicable as there has been no\n\n  \"trial\" before either the District Court or the High Court. On the other hand,\n\n  if the suit is finally disposed of by the District Court at a trial resulting in a final\n\n  judgment being given, that judgment may be taken on appeal to the High Court, but from the\n\n  decision of the High Court on that appeal, there would be no further appeal to this court,\n\n  unless leave under s 34(2)(a) is obtained.\"</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure that the application of s 34(2)(a) does not\n\nlead to anomalous results this Court felt that the word \"trial\" should be\n\ninterpreted purposively. It noted that as the limit of $250,000 in s.34(2)(a) was also the\n\nupper limit of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the objective of s.34(2)(a) was to\n\nensure that where appeals from the decision of the District Court had been heard and\n\ndisposed of by the High Court, there should be no further appeals therefrom to the Court\n\nof Appeal unless (on sufficient grounds shown) leave of either the High Court or this\n\nCourt was obtained. The provision provide for a process to screen appeals to be brought to\n\nthis Court, thus preventing the clogging up of this Court by all kinds of appeals. What\n\nwas contemplated by the legislature in relation to an action commenced in the District\n\nCourt was that there should be only two tiers of hearing \u2013 the first instance hearing\n\nand an appeal. A further appeal to the Court of Appeal was only possible with leave.</p>\n\n<p>20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing in <i>Spandeck Engineering</i> suggests that the words\n\n\"at the trial\" in s 34(2)(a) should be read to mean \"at the appeal\".\n\nAll that <i>Spandeck Engineering </i>decided was that the word \"trial\" should\n\nnot be read to mean only a \"hearing in open court with the calling of\n\nwitnesses\". There could be a \"trial\" when the \"hearing\" was based\n\npurely on affidavits. In our judgment, to read the word \"trial\" to mean\n\n\"appeal\" would do violence to the ordinary meaning of that word and would be\n\nwholly unwarranted.</p>\n\n<p>21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard two Malaysian cases are germane. In <i>Chan Kee\n\nBeng v Ramasamy Naidu</i> [1939] MLJ 92, the material provision was \"if the amount or\n\nvalue of the subject matter of any civil suit does not exceed $100, no appeal shall\n\nlie.\" Mill J held that the determining factor was not the amount or the value of the\n\nsubject matter of the appeal, but the amount or value of the subject matter of the civil\n\nsuit.</p>\n\n<p>22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a recent Malaysian Federal Court case, <i>Yai Yen Hon v Teng\n\nAh Kok &amp; Sim Huat Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor </i><a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=42886&amp;freetext=\">[1997] 1 MLJ 136</a>, a similar point arose.\n\nUnder the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964, leave to appeal was required \"when\n\nthe amount or value of the subject matter of the claim\" was less than M$100,000/-.\n\nThere, the plaintiff\u2019s claim was well in excess of M$100,000 but the High Court only\n\ngave judgment to the plaintiff in the sum of M$62,400. The Federal Court held that whether\n\nthere was a right to appeal depended on the value of the claim and not the award given by\n\nthe trial judge.</p>\n\n<p>23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A much earlier English case, <i>Dreesman v Harris</i> (1854) 9\n\nExch 485, had also decided to a similar effect. That was an action in the county court for\n\nbreach of contract and the claim exceeded 20, though the judge gave judgment only for\n\n12. The court held that no leave need be obtained to appeal. It was argued there that\n\nsuch a construction would mean that a plaintiff could reserve to himself the right of\n\nappeal in all cases by extending his claim to a sum exceeding 20. This argument was\n\nrejected.</p>\n\n<p>24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We accept that it could be different if bad faith could be shown\n\nin the formulation of the claim: see <i>Mason v Burningham</i> [1949] 2 KB 545 and <i>Mayer\n\nv Burgess</i> (1855) 4 E&amp;B 655. We would further add that a party who unreasonably\n\ninflates his claim may be penalised when the question of costs arises for consideration.\n\nThis would undoubtedly act as a deterrence.</p>\n\n<p>25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the instant case, the quantum of the claim at the trial was\n\nwell in excess of S$250,000. There was no suggestion that this was not a <i>bona fide</i>\n\nclaim. Accordingly, we held that no leave of court need be obtained by Tan Chiang to file\n\nthe present appeal (CA 600133/2001), which is now pending.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nExtension of time for service</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we turn to consider briefly the question of an extension\n\nof time to enable Tan Chiang to serve the notice of appeal on PPH out of time. As\n\nmentioned before, the notice was served on PPH on 11 January 2002. It is clear that under\n\nO 57, r 4 the notice should have been served on PPH on 31 December 2002, the day it was\n\nfiled. This is because the filing and service must both be done within a month of the\n\njudgment appealed against.</p>\n\n<p>27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The factors which a court should take into account in exercising\n\nits discretion whether or not to extend time to enable a party to file a notice of appeal\n\nout of time were considered and reiterated by this Court in <i>Pearson v Chen Chien Wen\n\nEdwin</i> [1991] SLR 212. The factors are: (i) the length of the delay; (ii) the reason of\n\nthe delay; (iii) the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for appealing is extended;\n\nand (iv) the degree of prejudice to the would-be respondent if the application is granted.\n\nThe governing principles were recently reviewed by this Court in <i>Nomura Regionalisation\n\nVenture Fund Ltd v Ethical Investments Ltd </i><a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59541&amp;freetext=\">[2000] 4 SLR 46</a>.</p>\n\n<p>28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were circumstances in the case which deserved the\n\ncourt\u2019s consideration. First, the electronic filing system (EFS) of the Supreme Court\n\nwas only recently extended to include documents filed in Civil Appeals to the Court of\n\nAppeal. Second, Tan Chiang initiated the process to file the notice of appeal at 1.00pm on\n\n28 December 2001. Due to certain technicalities, Tan Chiang only managed to file the\n\nnotice on 31 December at 11.51am. Third, certain situations arose which had a bearing on\n\nthe oversight and here we would quote from an affidavit filed by the solicitor on behalf\n\nof Tan Chiang:- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"The Applicants waited for the Certificate for Security for Costs\n\n  and Notice of Appeal to be approved before service on the respondents. My staff who was in\n\n  charge of the EFS filing of the Notice of Appeal left our employment. Another staff was\n\n  assigned to monitor the same.</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The appellants were distracted the next few days by a dispute between\n\n  the applicants and the respondents over the wording of the judgment of the court below.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The new staff retrieved the Notice of Appeal from the EFS system on 9\n\n  January 2002 and served the same on 11 January 2002.\"</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Further amplification of these was set out in a later affidavit.\n\nFourth, and more importantly, PPH were notified on 26 December 2001 that Tan Chiang were\n\nfiling a notice of appeal.</p>\n\n<p>29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The delay in the service was only some nine days, as 1 January\n\n2002 was a public holiday. Tan Chiang had provided some reasons to explain the delay,\n\ncaused in part by the change in the system of filing following the expansion of the EFS to\n\ncivil appeals. It could not be seriously argued that the appeal was without merits. In\n\nview of the fact that the delay was only some nine days and PPH was notified that an\n\nappeal was being filed, there could be no question of any prejudice.</p>\n\n<p>30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we have stated, Rajendran J was favourably inclined towards\n\ngranting an extension of time for service if not for the fact that he held the view that\n\nthe notice of appeal was invalid because leave was required and not obtained. For the\n\nforegoing reasons, we were similarly of the opinion that in the circumstances of this case\n\nan extension of time for service ought to be given, which we duly granted.</p>\n\n<font face=\"CG Times,CG Times\" size=\"4\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\"/></font>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Sgd:</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">CHAO HICK TIN<br/>\n\nJUDGE OF APPEAL</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Sgd:</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">TAN LEE MENG<br/>\n\nJUDGE</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The judgment was upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeal (<a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7402&amp;freetext=\">[1993] 3 SLR 148</a>) and\n\nfinally by the Privy Council (<a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10056&amp;freetext=\">[1996] 2 SLR 297</a>).</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The issue in the present appeal concerns only the one lot of 27 Overseas Union\n\nBank (OUB) shares. At the trial of the consolidated action, it was established, that all the movable\n\nproperties (including stocks and shares) in Singapore belonging to the Kongsi were registered in the\n\nname of Nam.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">However, on 30 April 1962, Nam purported to give the 27 shares to Tng as a gift\n\nby way of transfer. Following the transfer, Tng had taken up and paid for the rights issues\n\noriginating from the 27 shares. OUB had also issued bonus shares. Through the splitting of the par\n\nvalue of each share from $100 to $1, and through the declaration of bonus shares and rights issue\n\nover the years, the 27 shares had become 125,564 shares, each of $1 par value.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on the intention on the part of Nam to give Tng the 27 shares, Tng advanced\n\nthe argument that the appropriate portion of the 27 shares which beneficially belonged to Nam (by\n\nvirtue of his 8/21 shareholding in the Kongsi and a share in STTCK) should be treated as having been\n\ngiven to Tng.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In April 1999, Tng and Woon, in their capacity as the executors and trustees of\n\nNam, instituted an Originating Summons to seek the court's determination of two questions: (a) the\n\nrights of the parties with respect to the gift of the 27 shares from Nam to on 30 April 1962 and\n\nmore particularly the portion of the gift that Nam held a beneficial interest through the Kongsi and\n\nSTTCK (the gift question); (b) whether Tng is entitled to an indemnity and/or contribution in\n\nrespect of all costs and expenses incurred by him pertaining to the 27 shares from the estate of Nam\n\n(the reimbursement question).</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The defendant was Tng, in his personal capacity. Three beneficiaries of the\n\nestate of Nam intervened in the proceedings, and objected to the application on the ground that it\n\namounts to an abuse of the process of court as the issues had already been decided upon by the High\n\nCourt in the consolidated action. As the High Court had ordered that the executors and trustees of\n\nthe estate of Nam restore, inter alia, the 27 shares back to the Kongsi, the three interveners\n\nsubmitted that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> should apply to restrain this re-litigation. For\n\nthis Originating Summons, the High Court agreed that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> in the\n\nwider sense applied in the circumstances and ruled that Tng was precluded from re-litigating the\n\nissues sought.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Tng appealed, in his personal capacity, that in relation to the gift question two\n\nissues be addressed: (a) whether the gift from Nam to Tng of the 27 shares, which belonged to the\n\nKongsi, were effective to convey to Tng the portion of those 27 shares owned by Nam through his\n\ninterest in the Kongsi; and (b) whether the transfer of the 27 shares by Nam to Tng raises the\n\npresumption of advancement.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">As to costs, the interveners, in their case, challenged that the High Court was\n\nwrong in not granting costs to Tng and Woon in their representative capacity. The interveners\n\ncontended that, the costs of Tng and Woon in their representative capacity, should be paid by Tng\n\npersonally as the proceeding was brought by Tng pursuant to his personal interest. Further, the\n\neffect of the order that there be no order on costs in favour of Tng and Woon in their\n\nrepresentative capacity would mean that such costs would have to be borne ultimately by the\n\nbeneficiaries of the estate. However, the interveners did not file any notice of appeal against such\n\norder of costs, and merely stated their challenges in their Case and submission.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Held</p></b>, dismissing the appeal:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(1) The true basis for the doctrine of <i>res judicata </i>in the wider sense\n\n  is to be found in the concept of abuse of process of the court. It is not in the public interest\n\n  that in relation to a single matter there could be multiplicity of proceedings (see  22-25); <i>Henderson\n\n  v Henderson</i> [1843] All ER 378, <i>Talbot v Berkshire County Council</i> [1994] QB 290 at 296, <i>Yat\n\n  Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd &amp; Anor</i> [1975] AC 581, <i>Ng Chee Chong v Toh\n\n  Kouw</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49413&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 4 SLR 45</a>, <i>Ching Mun Fong v Liu Cho Chit</i> [2000] 1 SLR 51,<i> Greenhalgh v\n\n  Mallard</i> [1947] 2 All ER 255 at 257 followed.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(2) However, in determining whether a case falls within the scope of <i>res\n\n  judicata</i> in the wider sense, great care should be exercised as it would amount to shutting out\n\n  a subject of litigation (see  26); <i>Ng Chee Chong v Toh Kouw</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49413&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 4 SLR 45</a>, <i>Lawlor v\n\n  Gray</i> [1984] 3 All ER 345 at 352 followed.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(3) As to the gift question, for the application of the doctrine of <i>res\n\n  judicata</i>, the condition of the similar identity of the parties was fulfilled. As to the\n\n  condition of the similar identity of the subject matter, the doctrine of <i>res judicata </i>in\n\n  the strict sense cannot apply. The issues which Tng now in his personal capacity wishes to put\n\n  before the court were clearly not before the court in the consolidated action (see  28-30).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(4) As to the gift question, the doctrine of <i>res judicata </i>in the wider\n\n  sense does not apply, as it concerns only the beneficiaries of the estate of Nam. It would not be\n\n  appropriate to raise it in the consolidated action (see  31).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(5) When Nam transferred the 27 shares to Tng, Nam was under the impression\n\n  that the 27 shares were his beneficially. With the 1992 High Court judgment declaring that the 27\n\n  shares did not belong to Nam but to the Kongsi, and that Nam acted in breach of trust when he\n\n  transferred the 27 shares to Tng, the 27 shares were not Nams to give to Tng. As it was Nams\n\n  intention to give away all the 27 shares, the court could not infer from that that Nam would also\n\n  have the intention to give away to Tng only that part which beneficially belonged to Nam (see \n\n  34-35).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(6) For there to be a gift, two elements must be present: the intent to give\n\n  and the precise subject matter to be given, to be followed by proper conveyance. Here, both the\n\n  elements are missing (see  35).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(7) As to the reimbursement question, the 1992 High Court judgment had made an\n\n  order that an account be taken of all bonus and rights issues which had been declared in respect\n\n  of the 27 shares and all moneys expended to take up the shares. The doctrine of <i>res judicata </i>in\n\n  the strict sense applied to estop Tng from pursuing the matter against the estate of Nam. In any\n\n  event, there is no basis upon which Tng could make a claim against the estate of Nam on account of\n\n  expenditures incurred on behalf of the Kongsi. Further, there is no evidence that Tng had expended\n\n  his own personal resources to take up the rights issues of the 27 shares (see  42-44).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(8) As to costs, as the interveners had raised the defence of the doctrine of <i>res\n\n  judicata </i>in relation to the gift question, and failed, they should thus be given only  costs\n\n  (see  45).</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(9) With regard to the costs of Tng and Woon in their representative capacity,\n\n  as the interveners have not filed any notice of appeal against the order of costs, preceded by an\n\n  application for leave as required by s 34(2)(b) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, the court\n\n  was unable to consider their contentions. However, for this appeal, Tng and Woon, as executors and\n\n  trustees of the estate of Nam are entitled to the costs thereof, to be paid by Tng personally (see\n\n   46-47).</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Per curiam</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In the context of husband and wife, the current approach is to treat the\n\npresumption of advancement as an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct\n\nevidence as to the intention of the parties, rather than as an oft-applied rule of the thumb.\n\nHowever, the court left open the question of whether the presumption of advancement in the context\n\nof father and son has similarly been weakened, and thus is readily rebutted by comparatively slight\n\nevidence (see  36-37 ) <i>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49598&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 4 SLR 560</a>, <i>Pettitt v Pettitt </i>[1970] AC 777 followed, <i>Shephard v Cartwright</i> [1955] AC 431 and <i>McGrath v Wallis</i> [1995] 2 FLR\n\n114 referred.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Case(s) referred to</p></b>:\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Ching Mun Fong v Liu Cho Chit</p></i> [2000] 1 SLR 51 (folld)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Greenhalgh v Mallard</p></i> [1947] 2 All ER 255 at 257 (folld)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Henderson v Henderson</p></i> [1843] All ER 378 (folld)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Lawlor v Gray</p></i> [1984] 3 All ER 345 at 352 (folld)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">McGrath v Wallis</p></i> [1995] 2 FLR 114 (refd)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Ng Chee Chong v Toh Kouw</p></i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49413&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 4 SLR 45</a> (folld)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Pettitt v Pettitt </p></i>[1970] AC 777 (folld)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Shephard v Cartwright</p></i> [1955] AC 431 (refd)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Talbot v Berkshire County Council</p></i> [1994] QB 290 at 296 (folld)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</p></i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49598&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 4 SLR 560</a> (folld)\n\n<i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd &amp; Anor</p></i> [1975] AC 581 (folld)\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Legislation referred to</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) s 34(2)(b)</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" color=\"#3322AA\" size=\"4\"><strong>JUDGMENT:</strong></font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\" color=\"#804040\"><i>Cur Adv Vult</i></font></strong></p>\n\n<font face=\"Times New Roman\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\">1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is an appeal by the plaintiff (Tng) against a decision\n\nof Amerjeet Singh JC, dismissing the plaintiffs claim in relation to a lot of 27 Overseas Union\n\nBank (OUB) shares, hereinafter referred to as \"the 27 shares\".

Their father, Lee Hum Chye, came to Singapore in 1917 and in the following year\n\nhe gave his savings to the three sons and also set up a family fund called \"Sze Teck Tng Chye\n\nKee\" (STTCK). Lee Hum Chye died shortly thereafter. The businesses of the three sons prospered.\n\nIn 1927, Kheng, Nam and Kiat decided to pool their resources and established a partnership, Wee Kee\n\nKongsi (the Kongsi). STTCK was given a share in the Kongsi. Later in the same year, Kiat died. The\n\nbusiness of the Kongsi continued to prosper. In October 1940, the estate of Kiat relinguished its\n\ninterest in the Kongsi by way of a deed of release. After the death of Kiat, the shares in the\n\nKongsi were redistributed in the following proportions:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Kheng 9/21</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Nam 8/21</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">STTCK 4/21</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">We should add that even after the deed of release, his estate was treated as\n\nhaving an equal share in STTCK, as the deed did not relate to anything due to Kiat under STTCK.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of the present proceeding, nothing on that is pertinent.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In February 1950, Kheng and Nam incorporated a company, Lee\n\nBrothers (Wee Kee) Ltd (Lee Brothers). All the immovable properties of the Kongsi and STTCK were\n\ntransferred to Lee Brothers.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In July 1962, Kheng died. In his Will, he appointed his two\n\nsons, Lee Hiok Kher (Kher) and Lee Hiok Hwee (Hwee) as his executors. We should add that long before\n\nhe died, Kheng spent much of his time in Bangkok. The businesses in Singapore of the Kongsi, as well\n\nas those of Lee Brothers, were managed by Nam.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the death of Kheng, the businesses of the Kongsi and\n\nLee Brothers continued as before. In January 1964, Nam died, having appointed his two sons, Lee Hiok\n\nTng (Tng) and Lee Hiok Woon (Woon) as his executors.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neither Nam, before his death, nor his executors, after his\n\ndeath, rendered any account to the executors and trustees of Kheng in relation to the assets of the\n\nKongsi. However, it is clear that in law, upon the death of Kheng, the partnership in the Kongsi was\n\ndissolved. The surviving partner or partners should wind up the affairs of the partnership and\n\ndistribute its assets to those who were entitled thereto. Indeed, the records would show that Nams\n\nexecutors and trustees were not even helpful towards Khengs executors and trustees, who were then\n\nseeking to ascertain the assets of the Kongsi.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a result, two actions (S 1401/73 and S 2457/81) were\n\ncommenced by some of the beneficiaries of the Kheng estate (sons and grandsons of Kheng hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the \"S &amp; G of Kheng\") against the executors and trustees of the Kheng\n\nestate as well as of the Nam estate. Eventually, both the actions were consolidated and tried\n\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the consolidated action, the S &amp; G of Kheng sued Tng\n\nand Woon as the executors and trustees of the estate of Nam for breaches of trust committed by Nam\n\nafter the death of Kheng in, inter alia, failing to wind up the partnership business, and in failing\n\nto give an account of the partnership business to the estate of Kheng. The S &amp; G of Kheng also\n\nsued Kwee and Kher as the executors and trustees of the Kheng estate for failing to get in the\n\nassets belonging to the Kheng estate. During the course of the trial of the consolidated action, the\n\nplaintiffs and the executors and trustees of the estate of Kheng reached a settlement and,\n\naccordingly, no further reliefs were sought against the executors and trustees of Kheng. So what\n\nremained of the consolidated action for which the High Court had to decide were, in the main,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) whether Nam had acted in breach of trust upon the death of Kheng, in\n\n  respect of the partnership assets; and whether upon the death of Nam, the latters executors and\n\n  trustees had similarly acted in breach of trust;</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(ii) whether the executors and trustees of the Nam estate were liable to\n\n  restore to the Kongsi certain specified shares, including 12,240 OCBC shares, three lots of 125,\n\n  27 and 125 shares in OUB (at $100 par value each) and 378,000 UOB shares (hereinafter referred to\n\n  collectively as the \"undisclosed shares\").</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should add that in the consolidated action, the estate\n\nof Kheng had also made a counterclaim against the estate of Nam relating to the undisclosed shares.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the course of the trial of the consolidated action, the\n\nestate of Nam conceded that the 378,000 UOB shares and one of the two 125 lots of OUB shares\n\nbelonged to the Kongsi. As regards the other three lots of undisclosed shares, the High Court in a\n\njudgment delivered in January 1992 (the 1992 judgment) held that they belonged to the Kongsi and the\n\nestate of Nam must account for the same. The court also held that Nam, as well as his executors and\n\ntrustees, had committed breaches of trust and ordered that an account be taken of the assets of the\n\nKongsi in respect of the period after the death of Kheng.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Issues in the present action</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issues in the present OS concerns only the one lot of\n\n27 OUB shares. At the trial of the consolidated action, it was established, and also not disputed,\n\nthat all the movable properties (including stocks and shares) in Singapore belonging to the Kongsi\n\nwere registered in the name of Nam. It would appear that on 30 April 1962, Nam purported to give the\n\n27 shares to Tng as a gift by way of transfer. However, by virtue of the 1992 judgment, the\n\nexecutors and trustees of Nam had to restore those 27 shares to the Kongsi. Nevertheless, based on\n\nthe intention on the part of Nam to give Tng the 27 shares, Tng advanced the argument that the\n\nappropriate portion of the 27 shares which beneficially belonged to Nam (by virtue of his 8/21\n\nshareholding in the Kongsi and a share in STTCK) should be treated as having been given to Tng.\n\nTherefore, in April 1999, Tng and Woon, in their capacity as the executors/trustees of Nam,\n\ninstituted the present OS to seek the court's determination of the following two questions:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">1. The determination of the rights of the parties with respect to the gift of\n\n  the 27 Overseas Union Bank (\"OUB\") shares from Lee Wee Nam to Lee Hiok Tng on or about\n\n  30<sup>th</sup> April 1962 and more particularly the portion of the gift that Lee Wee Nam held a\n\n  beneficial interest through Wee Kee Kongsi and Sze Teck Tng Chye Kee.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">2. That it may be determined whether Lee Hiok Tng is entitled to an indemnity\n\n  and/or contribution in respect of all costs and expenses incurred by him pertaining to the said 27\n\n  OUB shares from the Estate of Lee Wee Nam.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The defendant to the OS is Tng, in his personal capacity. For ease of reference,\n\nprayer 1 will be referred to as \"the gift question\" and prayer 2 \"the reimbursement\n\nquestion\".</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, in February 2000, Lee Siew Choon (Choon), Lee\n\nSiew Hong (Hong) and Lee Siew Ngung (Ngung), three beneficiaries of the Nam estate (hereinafter\n\ncollectively referred to as CHN) applied to intervene in the proceeding. They objected to the\n\napplication made by Nams executors and trustees on the ground that the application amounts to an\n\nabuse of the process of court as the issues had already been decided upon by the High Court in the\n\nconsolidated action.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As presented by counsel for Tng to the court below, the\n\ncourt needed to address and decide on the following issues on the gift question:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) whether the gift from Nam to Tng of the 27 shares, which belonged to the\n\n  Kongsi, were effective to convey to Tng the portion of those 27 shares owned by Nam through his\n\n  interest in the Kongsi.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(ii) whether the transfer of the 27 shares by Nam to Tng raises the presumption\n\n  of advancement.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In an affidavit, filed in his personal capacity, Tng\n\ndeposed that his father, Nam, transferred the 27 shares to him as a gift and that his offer to pay\n\nhis father for the 27 shares was declined. He said he believed his father gave him those shares as\n\nan expression of his appreciation for all the assistance rendered by Tng to his fathers business\n\nin the previous thirty years. Following the transfer to him of those shares, Tng had taken up and\n\npaid for the rights issues originating from the 27 shares. OUB had also issued bonus shares. It\n\nwould appear that the original 27 shares, through the splitting of the par value of each share from\n\n$100 to $1, and through the declaration of bonus shares and rights issue over the years, had become\n\n125,564 shares, each of $1 par value.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, CHN argued, inter alia, that by virtue\n\nof the High Court decision in the consolidated action declaring that the 27 shares belonged to the\n\nKongsi, Nam was holding those shares in trust for the Kongsi. CHN also pointed out that while in the\n\nconsolidated action, Tng did file a defence, he failed to turn up and testify to claim for the 27\n\nshares. Similarly, Woon too, did not elect to testify at that trial. In any event, any purported\n\ntransfer of the 27 shares would have been in breach of trust. In the light of the courts order\n\nthat the executors and trustees of the Nam estate restore, inter alia, the 27 shares back to the\n\nKongsi, CHN submitted that the principle of <i>res judicata</i> or estoppel should apply to restrain\n\nthis re-litigation.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Decision below</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge below agreed with CHN and ruled that Tng was\n\nprecluded from re-litigating the issues sought in the OS. He said (though at times without clearly\n\nseparating Tngs personal capacity from his representative capacity):-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Having considered the Affidavit evidence and all the submissions and the\n\n  Counsel of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs having conceded by agreeing that the\n\n  27 OUB shares formed part of the assets of Wee Kee Kongsi and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>\n\n  Plaintiffs having accepted the decision of Chao J on the issue of the ownership of the 27 OUB\n\n  shares, there was no doubt in my mind that the Defendant (in his personal capacity but the alter\n\n  ego of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff) was attempting to re-litigate the matter to the entitlement\n\n  of the 27 OUB shares. The Defendant had failed to pursue his claim in the trial before Chao J\n\n  after filing his defence by testifying and subjecting himself to cross-examination concerning his\n\n  claim or claims which Plaintiffs Counsel was now articulating.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After referring to the reasons given by the High Court, the\n\nCourt of Appeal and the Privy Council in the consolidated action on why the 27 shares belonged to\n\nthe Kongsi, the judge below concluded (at 18):-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"In my opinion therefore, the Defendant could not reassert his claim to\n\n  the 27 OUB shares to say that the several issues defined by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>\n\n  Plaintiffs Counsel as set out earlier had not arisen in the Consolidated Suit and claim that\n\n  there was as such no re-litigation of the issues here. The truth is the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff\n\n  (the Defendant) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff could and should have raised the issue there as\n\n  they were Defendants to the Suit. They chose not to. The judgment of Chao J upheld by the Court of\n\n  Appeal and the Privy Council touching on the issue of the 27 OUB shares therefore operated both as\n\n  an estoppel by record and as an issue estoppel against the Defendant. Such judgment prevented both\n\n  the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff who is also the Defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff from\n\n  denying or re-agitating the facts on which it is based. The only exception when a judgment does\n\n  not operate as such is when it is obtained by fraud or collusion which is plainly not the case\n\n  here. The proceeding by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs and the claim by the\n\n  Defendant was an abuse of the process of court.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge held that as the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi\n\nas a composite whole, there was no question of the lot of shares being split up although Nams\n\nestate would, in accordance with the partnership agreement, get 8/21 share of the 27 shares and Tngs\n\ninterest in the said share was only in his capacity as one of the beneficiaries of Nams estate.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the alternative remedy which Tng sought for\n\nreimbursement on the ground that he had expended money to take up rights issues in the belief that\n\nthe 27 shares were a gift to him and with no knowledge that the gift was in breach of trust, the\n\ncourt nevertheless held that that application must also fail. The judge felt that Tng and Woon,\n\nhaving failed to explain the position in the consolidated action, were bound by the decision in that\n\naction.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b><i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Res judicata</p>\n\n</i></b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main question that arises for consideration in this\n\nappeal is whether the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> in the wider sense applied in the\n\ncircumstances of this case.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>locus classicus</i> on <i>res judicata</i> in the\n\nwider sense may be found in the speech of Wigram V-C in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> [1843] All ER\n\n378 where he expounded the following principles:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication\n\n  by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that litigation to <i>bring\n\n  forward their whole case</i>, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same\n\n  parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matters which<i> might have been\n\n  brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, </i>only\n\n  because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case.\n\n  The plea of <i>res judicata</i> applies, except in special cases, <i>not only to points upon which\n\n  the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to\n\n  every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties,\n\n  exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time</i>. (Emphasis added).</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Talbot v Berkshire County Council</i> [1994] QB 290\n\nat 296 Stuart-Smith LJ clarified the two situations where <i>res judicata</i> arises as follows:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The first relates to those points which were actually decided by the court;\n\n  this is <i>res judicata</i> in the strict sense. Secondly, those which might have been brought\n\n  forward at the time, but were not. The second is not a true case of <i>res judicata</i> but rather\n\n  is founded upon the principle of public policy in preventing multiplicity of actions, it being in\n\n  the public interest that there should be an end to litigation; the court will stay or strike out\n\n  the subsequent action as an abuse of process.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two senses of <i>res judicata</i> expounded by Wigram\n\nV-C was accepted by the Privy Council in the Hong Kong case <i>Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng\n\nBank Ltd &amp; Anor</i> [1975] AC 581 and by this court in <i>Ng Chee Chong v Toh Kouw</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49413&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 4 SLR 45</a> and <i>Ching Mun Fong v Liu Cho Chit</i> [2000] 1 SLR 51. In <i>Yat Tung Investment</i>, Lord\n\nKilbrandon in referring to the extended sense of <i>res judicata</i>, adopted very much the same\n\nlanguage as that of Wigram V-C:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"> where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of\n\n  adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that\n\n  litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances)\n\n  permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might\n\n  have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest .\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear that the true basis for the extended sense of\n\nthe doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> is to be found in the concept of abuse of process of the court.\n\nIt is not in the public interest that in relation to a single matter there could be multiplicity of\n\nproceedings. In <i>Ching Mun Fong</i>, this Court endorsed the following passage of Somervell LJ in <i>Greenhalgh\n\nv Mallard</i> [1947] 2 All ER 255 at 257:-</p>\n\n<i>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">res judicata</p></blockquote></i><font face=\"Times New Roman\"> for this purpose is not confined\n\n  to the issues which the court is actually asked to decide, but  it covers issues or facts which\n\n  are so clearly part of the subject matter of the litigation and so clearly could have been raised\n\n  that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new proceeding to be started in\n\n  respect of them.</font>\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\">26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But in determining whether a case falls within the scope of\n\n<i>res judicata</i> in the extended sense, this Court in <i>Ng Chee Chong</i> noted that great care\n\nshould be exercised as it would amount to shutting out a subject of litigation. There, this court\n\nrelied in particular, the following sentiments of Gibson J in <i>Lawlor v Gray</i> [1984] 3 All ER\n\n345 at 352.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The words of the Vice Chancellor (in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i>) ought not to\n\n  be treated like the words of a statute and no doubt it is right to construe them in a\n\n  non-technical common sense way. But it should always be borne in mind that what is sought by the\n\n  party claiming the estoppel is the shutting out of a matter not previously pronounced on expressly\n\n  in the earlier litigation from the determination of the court.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, Tng made it clear at the outset that by raising\n\nthe gift question in the OS he is not seeking to go behind the 1992 judgment, which was upheld by\n\nthis Court and the Privy Council. He emphasised that what was basically decided in the 1992 judgment\n\nrelated to certain assets of the Kongsi, and, in the process, the court had to determine whether\n\nNam, and later his executors and trustees, had committed breaches of trust. The true object of the\n\nconsolidated action was to determine the extent of the assets of the Kongsi. Having decided that,\n\nthe court had to make a number of consequential orders.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the essential conditions, which must be satisfied\n\nbefore <i>res judicata</i> can arise is that there should be identity of parties. It would be clear\n\nfrom the background given above that there were three sets of parties in the consolidated action.\n\nFirst, there were the S &amp; G of Kheng, beneficiaries under the Kheng estate, who instituted the\n\ntwo actions which were consolidated. Second, there were Tng and Woon, both being sued in their\n\nrepresentatives, as well as in their personal, capacities. Third, there were Kwee and Kher also\n\nbeing sued in both their representative and personal capacities. Though originally the S &amp; G of\n\nKheng had sued Kwee and Kher for failing in their duties as executors/trustees of the Kheng estate,\n\nby the time the trial of the consolidated action came on, the two sides had resolved their\n\ndifferences and the S &amp; G of Kheng had abandoned their claim against Kwee and Kher. Thereafter,\n\nthey stood on the same side as Kwee and Kher, who were parties to the action, both in their\n\nrepresentative as well as their personal capacities. The battle lines drawn was between the Kheng\n\nestate on the one side and the Nam estate on the other.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the instant OS, the plaintiffs are Tng and Woon in their\n\ncapacity as executors and trustees of the Nam estate. The defendant is Tng in his personal capacity.\n\nThe interveners, CHN, are the beneficiaries under the Nam estate. While CHN were not parties to the\n\nconsolidated action, Tng and Woon, in their representative capacity, were. As CHN claim their\n\ninterest through Tng and Woon in their representative capacity, CHN will be deemed to be privy to\n\nthe consolidated action. Thus, the condition of identity of parties is fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to consider whether the condition relating to\n\nthe identity of subject matter is satisfied in this case. There can be no doubt that <i>res judicata</i>\n\nin the strict sense cannot apply. The question is whether <i>res judicata</i> in the extended sense\n\ncould. The issues which Tng now in his personal capacity wishes to put before the court were clearly\n\nnot before the court in the consolidated action. The only question that remains is whether these\n\nissues can be considered to be issues which \"belonged to the subject of litigation\" in the\n\nconsolidated action. We would reiterate that the primary issue in the consolidated action was in\n\ndetermining whether certain shares, including the 27 shares, belonged to the Kongsi or to Nam\n\npersonally. In passing, we would add that the court there had also decided the question relating to\n\nthe scope of a particular settlement reached between the S &amp; P of Kheng and the Nam estate.\n\nHowever, this aspect of the decision has no bearing whatsoever to the present OS.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To determine whether <i>res judicata</i> in the extended\n\nsense applies to this OS, there is a need to consider the two questions raised therein, the gift\n\nquestion and the reimbursement question, separately, as the answers to both may not be the same. We\n\nshall first deal only with the gift question. Does that question, as now formulated by Tng, falls\n\nwithin \"the subject of litigation\" in the consolidated action? In our opinion, the answer\n\nis a clear negative. The gift question would concern only the beneficiaries of the Nam estate. It\n\nwould not be appropriate to raise it in the consolidated action. Indeed the gift question would only\n\narise if the court, as it did, ruled that the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi rather than to Nam\n\npersonally. In our judgment, it would not facilitate the orderly disposal of the consolidated action\n\nif the gift question was raised then. It would be premature. There is no question of multiplicity of\n\naction by allowing Tng to raise the gift question at this stage.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result we hold that <i>res judicata</i> in the wider\n\nsense has no application to estop Tng from raising the gift question.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Gift question on merits</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to consider the gift question on its merits.\n\nThis can be disposed of fairly briefly. Tng contends that when his father Nam transferred the 27\n\nshares to him, Nam intended that transfer as a gift. Nam refused his payment for those shares. Tng\n\nsaid that although there was no written document under the hand of Nam evidencing that intention, it\n\nwas clear from all the background circumstances.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if we assume that what Tng now asserts is true, that\n\nNam intended the transfer as a gift, we still do not see how it could help Tngs claim. Obviously\n\nwhen Nam transferred the 27 shares to Tng, Nam was under the impression that the 27 shares were his\n\nbeneficially. With the 1992 judgment declaring that the 27 shares did not belong to Nam but to the\n\nKongsi, and that Nam acted in breach of trust when he transferred the 27 shares to Tng, the 27\n\nshares were not Nams to give. Indeed, the 1992 judgment declared that the 27 shares should be\n\nrestored to the Kongsi. The purported gift to Tng accordingly failed. In a portion of Tngs Case,\n\nhe seemed to be asking this Court to uphold his claim that the whole of 27 shares were a valid gift\n\nto him. We are unable to see how that contention could be made when the 27 shares did not even\n\nbelong to Nam.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It seems to us that what Tng now seeks to argue is that\n\nalthough Nam could not give to Tng all the 27 shares, but as Nam was the beneficial owner of some of\n\nthe 27 shares (by virtue of 8/21 share in the Kongsi and indirectly through STTCK), Nam must have\n\nalso intended to give to Tng that portion of the 27 shares which beneficially belonged to Nam in\n\nline with Nams share in the Kongsi. What Tng wants us to rule is that even though Nam was in no\n\nposition to give away the 27 shares to Tng as they belonged to the Kongsi, we could construe from\n\nsuch a purported gift of the 27 shares that there must have been an intention on the part of Nam to\n\ngive to Tng that part of the 27 shares which beneficially belonged to Nam. We do not think it would\n\nbe justified at all to make such an inference. As we view it, the two intentions are not consistent.\n\nAs it was Nams intention to give away all the 27 shares, one cannot infer from that that Nam\n\nwould also have the intention to give away only that part which beneficially belonged to Nam. This\n\nsecond scenario could not have entered into Nams mind. For there to be a gift, two elements must\n\nbe present: the intent to give and the precise subject matter to be given, to be followed by proper\n\nconveyance (e.g., land by deed and chattels by delivery). Here, both the elements are missing.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Presumption of Advancement</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We ought to mention that Tng has also made an argument\n\nbased on the presumption of advancement in view of the fact that there is no documentary proof of a\n\ngift. This presumption is essentially an evidential rule, based on relationship (e.g., husband and\n\nwife, father and son), to rebut the opposing presumption of a resulting trust where a transfer of\n\nproperty is made by one person to another without consideration. In <i>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</i>\n\n<a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49598&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 4 SLR 560</a>, this Court, after considering <i>Pettitt v Pettitt </i>[1970] AC 777, observed\n\nthat, in the context of husband and wife, the application of this presumption has diminished in\n\nrecent years in line with changing social norms. It also noted that the current approach is to treat\n\nthe presumption \"as an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct evidence\n\nas to the intention of the parties rather than as an oft-applied rule of the thumb\".</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">37.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An interesting question is whether the current approach\n\ntowards the presumption in the context of husband and wife should also be applied to the context of\n\nfather and son. We note that in <i>Shephard v Cartwright</i> [1955] AC 431, a case where shares\n\nacquired by a father was registered in the name of a child, Viscount Simonds said that:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Where a man purchases shares and they are registered in the name of a stranger\n\n  there is a resulting trust in favour of the purchaser; on the other hand, if they are registered\n\n  in the name of a child or one to whom the purchaser then stood in loco parentis, there is no such\n\n  resulting trust but a presumption of advancement. Equally it is clear that the presumption may be\n\n  rebutted but should not, as Lord Eldon said, give way to slight circumstances: <i>Finch v Finch.</i></p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\">38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But in <i>McGrath v Wallis</i> [1995] 2 FLR 114, the Court\n\nof Appeal extended the views of Lord Upjohn in <i>Pettitt v Pettitt (supra),</i> namely, that the\n\npresumption of advancement in the context of husband and wife was readily rebutted by comparatively\n\nslight evidence, and applied it to the context of father and son. This could be viewed as a further\n\nshift in judicial attitude in the light of changing social conditions. However, for the purposes of\n\nthis case, there is no need for us to go further into that as we are of the view that whichever way\n\nthe presumption is applied, it will not be of any assistance to Tng, as the problems here are not\n\nthose related to the question of resulting trust but to problems of identification of the intention\n\nof the giver (Nam) and the objects which are the subject of that intention.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">39.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, prayer 1 of the OS must fail.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Reimbursement Question</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">40.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to consider the second issue raised in the OS,\n\nnamely, that Tng should be entitled to be reimbursed by the Nam estate in respect of \"all costs\n\nand expenses incurred by him\" pertaining to the 27 shares or that the Nam estate should make a\n\ncontribution in relation thereto. The judge below ruled that Tng was barred from seeking\n\nreimbursement or contribution by reason of <i>res judicata</i> in the extended sense.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">41.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, Tng relied upon <i>Rowley v Ginnever</i>\n\n[1897] 2 Ch 503 where it was held that a constructive trustee of property who expended money in\n\nimproving what he <i>bona fidely</i> believed to be his own property, was held to be entitled to be\n\nrecouped of his expenditure, to the extent of the improved value.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">42.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this reimbursement question we need to go back to the\n\n1992 judgment. There, the court besides declaring that the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi, also\n\nmade an order in these terms:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"6. An account of all bonus and rights issues which had been declared in\n\n  respect of the shares specified in paragraph 5 (which includes the 27 OUB shares) and all moneys\n\n  expended to take up the shares.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">43.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This order was made obviously in recognition of the fact\n\nthat moneys had been expended to take up additional OUB shares pursuant to rights issues (based on\n\nthe 27 shares). The matter had been decided upon and that was really it. If Tng, who was a party to\n\nthe consolidated action in his personal as well as his representative capacities, had complied with\n\nthat order he would have been reimbursed. But he did not, though he was bound by that order. In our\n\njudgment<i>, res judicata </i>in the strict sense applied to estop Tng from pursuing the matter\n\nagainst the Nam estate of which he is an executor and trustee. In any event, there is no basis upon\n\nwhich he may make a claim against the Nam estate on account of expenditures incurred on behalf of\n\nthe Kongsi.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">44.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In passing we would like to observe that there is one\n\nfurther difficulty in the way of this claim by Tng. There is no evidence that Tng had expended his\n\nown personal resources to take up the OUB rights issues.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Judgment and costs</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">45.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, the appeal of Tng is dismissed with costs to\n\nthe 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> respondents. However, as CHN have raised the defence of <i>res\n\njudicata</i> in relation to prayer 1 of the OS and that has been held by us to be inapplicable, CHN\n\nshould not be awarded costs for work done in relation thereto. Taking a broad view, we hold that CHN\n\nshould only be given  costs.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">46.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With regard to the costs of Tng and Woon in their\n\nrepresentative capacity (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents), we note that the court\n\nbelow did not grant them any costs. No appeal on that was lodged by Tng and Woon. However, CHN, in\n\ntheir Case, challenged the correctness of that order. They argued that the costs of Tng and Woon in\n\ntheir representative capacity should be paid by Tng personally, as the whole proceeding was brought\n\nabout by Tng pursuant to his personal interest. While there are some merits in this point, as the\n\npersonal interest of Tng is different from that of Tng and Woon in their representative capacity,\n\nand as the effect of the order that there be no order on costs in favour of Tng and Woon in their\n\nrepresentative capacity would mean that such costs would have to be borne ultimately by the\n\nbeneficiaries, we are nevertheless unable to consider this argument because CHN have not filed any\n\nnotice of appeal, preceded by an application for leave as required by s 34(2)(b) of the Supreme\n\nCourt of Judicature Act, against that order on costs.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">47.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, for this appeal, Tng and Woon, as executors and\n\ntrustees of the Nam estate shall be entitled to the costs thereof, to be paid by Tng personally. Of\n\ncourse, the actual quantum of the costs to be allowed to Tng and Woon in this capacity would have to\n\nbe assessed by the Registrar, taking into account the work done in relation thereto.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"100%\">\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"33%\">Yong Pung How</td>\n\n      <td width=\"33%\">L P Thean</td>\n\n      <td width=\"34%\">\n\n        <p align=\"left\">Chao Hick Tin</p></td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"33%\">Chief Justice</td>\n\n      <td width=\"33%\">Judge of Appeal</td>\n\n      <td width=\"34%\">Judge of Appeal</td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n  </table>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n</font>\n\n\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

However, its online services came to an abrupt halt sometime after the Singapore Land Authority (\u201cSLA\u201d) succeeded in its action for copyright infringement against VM in the District Court (\u201cthe copyright suit\u201d) (see <i>Singapore Land Authority v Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2007] SGDC 216</nobr> (\u201cthe DC decision\u201d)). On appeal, the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) affirmed the decision of the district judge (\u201cthe DJ\u201d) and dismissed VM\u2019s appeal on 25\u00a0March 2008 (see <i>Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority</i> <nobr>[2008] 3 SLR 86</nobr> (\u201cthe HC decision\u201d)). Consequently, VM filed a notice of appeal on 24\u00a0April 2008 against the Judge\u2019s decision (\u201cthe Notice of Appeal\u201d). SLA in turn applied, via Summons No\u00a02056 of 2008 (\u201cSUM\u00a02056\u201d), to strike out the Notice of Appeal on the basis that VM had not obtained the requisite leave of the court to appeal pursuant to s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 2007\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d). VM\u2019s position is that no leave of the court is required in order for it to appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision. However, without prejudice to its position, VM has filed Originating Summons No\u00a0561 of 2008 (\u201cOS\u00a0561\u201d) seeking leave from this court to appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision. VM had previously applied on 1\u00a0April 2008 to the Judge via Summons No\u00a01491 of 2008 (\u201cSUM\u00a01491\u201d) for leave to appeal, but that application was dismissed by the Judge on 21\u00a0April 2008.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is before us in the present instance is therefore not the substantive appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision, but, rather, two applications, <i>ie</i>, SUM\u00a02056 and OS\u00a0561, concerning the striking out of the Notice of Appeal and the grant of leave by this court for VM to appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision, respectively.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The background</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The detailed facts of this case have already been comprehensively set out in the judgment of the DJ (see [2]\u2013[13] of the DC decision).

By way of a letter dated 10\u00a0June 2004, SLA wrote to VM giving it 30 days\u2019 notice to terminate the licence agreements (all the licence agreements provided for termination by either party with not less than 30 days\u2019 notice). The reason for the termination of the licence agreements is unclear: VM contended that the licence agreements were terminated in anticipation of the launch of SLA\u2019s own online map-search service at www.map.gov.sg, while SLA explained that the licence agreements were terminated because it had become aware that VM had taken legal action against several different parties for unauthorised reproduction of VM\u2019s online maps and had demanded large payments in exchange for settling those copyright infringement suits, even in cases where the unauthorised reproduction had been minor and had already been removed. What is <i>undisputed</i>, however, is that the licence agreements duly came to an end as at 10\u00a0July 2004, and VM does not contend that SLA terminated the licence agreements wrongfully (see the DC decision at [9] and the HC decision at [4]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the termination of the licence agreements, SLA\u2019s solicitors wrote to VM on 20\u00a0July 2005 to demand that the latter cease using materials that contained reproductions of SLA\u2019s works.

She also found that there had been \u201cwidespread or wholesale copying\u201d (<i>id</i> at [91]) by VM of SLA\u2019s street directory vector data and address point vector data (collectively, these two sets of data will be referred to as \u201cthe copyright works\u201d) in VM\u2019s online maps, given especially the numerous \u201cfingerprints\u201d of copying found in those maps. These \u201cfingerprints\u201d consisted of, <i>inter alia</i>, deliberate errors inserted by SLA in the copyright works (see generally the DC decision at [76]\u2013[85]). The DJ, however, found that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d (<i>id</i> at [87]) to demonstrate that VM had copied the maps in the <i>Singapore Street Directory</i> since the evidence of copying advanced by SLA had primarily been in respect of the copyright works.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The DJ rejected VM\u2019s contention that its online maps were the result of independent creation using global positioning system (\u201cGPS\u201d) data and high-resolution satellite imagery, which was then validated on the ground and continuously revised and updated (\u201cthe GPS survey\u201d), and not the result of copying the copyright works. This was because, in addition to the fact that no cogent explanation was proffered by VM for the presence of the \u201cfingerprints\u201d in its online maps (see the DC decision at [119]), she found (crucially) that VM\u2019s map-making process was very much based on the copyright works (<i>id</i> at [116]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]n reality, VM\u2019s map-making process was heavily dependent on the raster maps in VM Space, the origins of which was SLA\u2019s vector data, and VM\u2019s vector data which, again, was derived from SLA\u2019s vector data.</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Vincent [VM\u2019s expert witness] spoke about the advent of \u201cnew age\u201d mapping using GIS [geographic information systems] software.

She also held that the alleged implied term that \u201cVM was allowed to keep any maps created under the licence agreements (as well as subsequent versions of the same) and to continue to maintain and market, distribute, sell or offer to sell or otherwise deal with the same\u201d (<i>id</i> at [137]), as contended by VM, \u201cflew in the face of the express terms of the licence agreements\u201d (<i>ibid</i>), and there was simply \u201cno \u2018business efficacy\u2019 to speak of\u201d (<i>ibid</i>) that could justify implying such a term, which would \u201ceffectively undermine SLA\u2019s legal right to have its intellectual property rights protected in accordance with the law and which would be contrary to the expressed intentions of the parties to the contract\u201d (<i>ibid</i>). The DJ also dismissed VM\u2019s defence based on estoppel on the ground that \u201c[t]here was no evidence that SLA had lulled VM into a false sense of security or into thinking that SLA had abandoned any intention to pursue a claim against it\u201d (see the DC decision at [145]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of her findings, the DJ granted all the reliefs asked for by SLA (save the prayer for full discovery of certain information and documents), including an injunction to restrain VM from infringing SLA\u2019s copyright in the copyright works and an order for the delivery up and/or destruction of all of VM\u2019s documents, the continued retention and/or use of which would be a breach of the injunction (<i>id</i> at [148]\u2013[149]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 VM appealed to the High Court against the whole of the DJ\u2019s decision. At the hearing of the appeal, VM informed the Judge that it was prepared to accept that SLA had copyright in the copyright works, but maintained that there had been no copying or substantial reproduction of those works (see the HC decision at [6]). The Judge eventually dismissed the appeal. He agreed with the findings made by the DJ at first instance, as well as her reasons as to why copyright infringement had been established in the instant case (<i>id</i> at [62]). Effectively, the Judge affirmed the DJ\u2019s decision, not just on the point of copying and substantial reproduction, but also on the construction of the licence agreements as well as the issue of estoppel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The issues before us</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned at the outset of this judgment (see [1] above), SLA applied in SUM\u00a02056 to strike out the Notice of Appeal on the basis that the court\u2019s leave to appeal was required pursuant to s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA (which provides that the court\u2019s leave is required if \u201cthe amount or value of the subject-matter at the trial is $250,000 \u2026 or less\u201d (see further [15] below)), and that such leave had not been obtained by VM prior to the filing of the Notice of Appeal.

This would strain the limited resources of the Court of Appeal.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Referring to its earlier decision in <i>Spandeck Engineering</i>, this court proceeded to observe as follows (see [19] of <i>Tan Chiang Brother\u2019s Marble</i>):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-SG\">[A]s the limit of $250,000 in s\u00a034(2)(a) was also the upper limit of the [D]istrict [C]ourt\u2019s jurisdiction, the objective of s\u00a034(2)(a) was to ensure that where appeals from the decision of the [D]istrict [C]ourt had been heard and disposed of by the High Court, there should be no further appeals therefrom to the Court of Appeal unless (on sufficient grounds [being] shown) leave of either the High Court or this court [</span></i><span lang=\"EN-SG\">ie<i>, the Court of Appeal] was obtained</i>. The provision provide[d] for a process to screen appeals to be brought to this court, thus preventing the clogging up of this court by all kinds of appeals. <i>What was contemplated by the legislature in relation to an action commenced in the [D]istrict [C]ourt was that there should be only two tiers of hearing \u2013 the first instance hearing and an appeal</i>. A further appeal to the Court of Appeal was only possible with leave. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">In a similar vein, this court reiterated in</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-SG\">Teo Eng Chuan</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">([16] <i>supra</i>)</span> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">that (<i>id</i> at [23]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-SG\">It is vitally important to bear in mind the scheme of things for civil appeals under the [1999] SCJA. <i>Generally, there should be one tier of appeal, whether it is a case from the District Court, or from the High Court</i>.

As will be demonstrated shortly, a proper reading of <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i> does not, in fact, support this unqualified proposition.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Our decision on whether leave to appeal is required</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 VM\u2019s reply to SLA\u2019s application in SUM\u00a02056 to strike out the Notice of Appeal was twofold. First, VM argued that, as it was appealing, <i>inter alia</i>, against the DJ\u2019s order that it deliver up to SLA and/or destroy (among other items) all its maps and products containing its maps, those maps and those products were part of the subject matter of the copyright suit. In this connection, VM contended that it had spent millions of dollars developing its maps, the actual value of which far exceeded $250,000, and, thus, the monetary value of the subject matter at the trial before the DJ exceeded $250,000 as far as VM\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal was concerned. Hence, no leave of the court under s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA was required. Second, VM argued, relying on this court\u2019s decision in <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>), that no specific monetary value could be placedon the subject matter at the trial in the context of the present proceedings and, accordingly, no leave of the court to appeal was required.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect to the second argument, we should point out that, in VM\u2019s application to the Judge for leave to appeal against his decision (<i>ie</i>, SUM\u00a01491 (see [1] above)), VM had argued that the following matters were the subject matter at the trial in the context of the present proceedings:</span><a id=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">[note: 4]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether an injunction \u2026 should be granted to [SLA];</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether [VM] would have to deliver up to [SLA], or destroy all its [<i>ie</i>, VM\u2019s] maps and products containing its maps; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether damages payable by [VM] to [SLA] should be assessed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Before us, VM repeated this argument. It submitted that \u201c[t]he subject matter of the trial, when viewed in totality, must refer to <i>all</i> of the relief that SLA sought\u201d</span><a id=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">[note: 5]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">[emphasis in original] and, since no monetary value could be placed on such relief, no leave of the court was required for an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as VM\u2019s first argument at [21] above is concerned, we find, as a matter of fact, that it is without merit. There is no evidence before the court, save for a bare assertion, that VM has expended millions of dollars developing its maps. VM\u2019s only evidence in this regard was a reference to <i>Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Suncool International Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] 2 SLR 157</nobr>, where Lai Kew Chai\u00a0J (\u201cLai\u00a0J\u201d) had referred (at [8]) to the District Court\u2019s decision in <i>Virtual Map (Singapore) Ltd v Suncool International Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2004] SGDC 190</nobr>, in which the District Court had (in turn) referred (at [9]) to the fact that <i>VM had said</i> that it had spent $3m developing, creating and maintaining its online map provision services. No evidence was adduced before Lai\u00a0J or in the present proceedings on the amount of money which VM had actually spent in that regard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, we are of the view that it is not open to VM to now argue that the monetary value of the subject matter of the trial in the present case exceeded $250,000 since it had proceeded to trial on the basis of SLA\u2019s claim being within and limited to the jurisdiction of the District Court. By accepting that the District Court had jurisdiction of the matter, VM is now <i>estopped</i> from asserting that the monetary value of the said subject matter exceeded $250,000. At the time of the trial, as far as SLA was concerned, VM\u2019s maps had no value because they were counterfeit, whereas, as far as VM was concerned, the maps had substantial value because they were not counterfeit and therefore could be used for commercial purposes. Be that as it may, if VM considered its maps to be worth an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limit of the District Court, it should have applied to have the entire action transferred to the High Court. That was not done. VM cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold in the same action by now asserting that its maps have a monetary value in excess of $250,000.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast, VM\u2019s second argument that leave of the court to appeal under s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA is not required because the subject matter at the trial in the present case has no specific monetary value (see [21] above) cannot be dismissed out of hand, and it is necessary for us to examine the decision in <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>) in some detail.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In that case, Pan-United Shipyard (\u201cPUS\u201d) contracted with Castle Shipping Company (\u201cCastle\u201d) to repair and supply equipment to Castle\u2019s vessel, <i>Dilmun Fulmar</i> (\u201cthe vessel\u201d). Castle failed to pay part of the bill, and PUS arrested the vessel. A settlement agreement (\u201cthe settlement agreement\u201d) was subsequently reached under which Castle agreed to pay PUS, in three instalments, a total of $310,000 in full and final settlement of the debt which it owed to the latter. The vessel was released after the first instalment of $140,000 was paid. Castle then sold the vessel to Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd (\u201cHailisen\u201d). After the sale, Castle failed to make the remaining instalment payments under the settlement agreement. PUS thus commenced an <i>in rem</i> action for the balance sum of $170,000 (\u201cthe <i>in rem</i> action\u201d) and arrested the vessel once again. Hailisen applied as an intervener to the <i>in rem</i> action to set aside the warrant of arrest and sought damages for wrongful arrest. Subsequently, the assistant registrar set aside the warrant of arrest, but did not award Hailisen any damages for wrongful arrest. On appeal by both PUS (against the setting aside of the warrant of arrest) and Hailisen (against the assistant registrar\u2019s refusal to award damages), Belinda Ang Saw Ean\u00a0J (\u201cAng\u00a0J\u201d) affirmed the assistant registrar\u2019s decision to set aside the warrant of arrest (see <i>The Dilmun Fulmar</i> <nobr>[2004] 1 SLR 140</nobr>); she also allowed Hailisen\u2019s appeal and held that Hailisen was entitled to damages to be assessed. PUS, in turn, appealed against Ang\u00a0J\u2019s decision. Hailisen argued that PUS was not entitled as of right (<i>ie</i>, without first obtaining the leave of the court) to appeal against Ang\u00a0J\u2019s decision since the claim in the <i>in rem</i> action was only for $170,000. Hailisen thus applied to have PUS\u2019s appeal struck out on the ground that PUS had failed to apply for the court\u2019s leave as required by s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the 1999 SCJA.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chao Hick Tin\u00a0JA, delivering the judgment of this court, held that the subject matter of the <i>in rem</i> action was not PUS\u2019s claim of $170,000. He explained (at [15] of <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i>):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-SG\">[T]he question to ask is what was the \u201csubject matter\u201d before Ang\u00a0J</span></i><span lang=\"EN-SG\">. Here, we must observe that while PUS was only claiming for $170,000, which ordinarily should have been [claimed by way of an action] commenced in a District Court, [PUS\u2019s claim] had to be commenced in the Singapore High Court because it was an</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-SG\">in rem</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-SG\">action. <i>What was before Ang\u00a0J was not the claim of $170,000 of PUS but the questions of whether the warrant of arrest of the vessel should be set aside and, if so, whether there should be an order for an assessment of damages</i>. Both these questions were the \u201csubject-matter\u201d before Ang\u00a0J which she answered in the affirmative. <i>Neither of them bore any specific value</i>. Indeed, the damages to be assessed [were] wholly at large. The claim of PUS in the main action [<i>ie</i>, the <i>in rem</i> action] could in no way limit the damages suffered by Hailisen due to the wrongful arrest. Therefore, the matter did not fall within s\u00a034(2)(a) [of the 1999 SCJA] and no leave was required. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At face value, it is difficult for us to disagree that VM\u2019s characterisation of the subject matter in the present case (which is, essentially, an unquantified claim for damages (as well as for the non-monetary remedies of an injunction and an order for the delivery up and/or destruction of infringing materials) in respect of breach of copyright) is supported by the decision of this court in <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd.</i> However, it does not, in our view, necessarily follow that <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i> is applicable to the present case. There is a material difference between the jurisdictional context in which the claim in <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i> was brought and that in which SLA\u2019s claim in the copyright suit was brought. In the present case, SLA made its claim in and within the jurisdiction of the District Court, thereby limiting its damages to $250,000 and no more. In contrast, in <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i>, the claims (<i>ie</i>, PUS\u2019s claim for the balance sum of $170,000 and Hailisen\u2019s claim for damages for wrongful arrest) were made in the High Court, which has unlimited jurisdiction, and Hailisen was not obliged to limit its claim for damages to a particular quantum. In our view, the decision in <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i> cannot be used as authority to found an argument that no leave of the court is required for an appeal to the Court of Appeal where the subject matter of the trial from which the appeal stems does not have a specific monetary value. The answer to VM\u2019s second argument as set out at [21] above is that the subject matter of the copyright suit in the present case did have a monetary value that was fixed by the jurisdiction of the District Court, <i>viz</i>, a monetary value not exceeding $250,000.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, there is a simpler answer to the problems associated with characterising the subject matter of an action and then trying to put a monetary value on it for the purposes of determining whether s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA applies. In the District Courts, the monetary value of the subject matter of an action is limited by the jurisdictional limit of $250,000. In the High Court, there is no such limit. Therefore, the question arises as to whether s\u00a034(2)(</span><i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">a</span></i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">) of the SCJA was ever intended to deal with admiralty claims, such as that arising in <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>), which, because of the special nature of their subject matter, are governed by a special statute, <i>viz</i>, the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap\u00a0123, 2001\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cHCAJA\u201d), and have to be pursued in the High Court. Prior to the enactment of s\u00a034(2)(</span><i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">a</span></i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">) of the SCJA in its present form to limit appeals as of right to the Court of Appeal in relation to claims which do not exceed $250,000 in value (in a legislative framework intended to provide only one tier of appeal as of right), any admiralty action, regardless of the monetary value of the claim therein, could form the basis of an appeal to the Court of Appeal <i>as of right</i>. Given the legislative policy of having only one tier of appeal as of right for civil cases and, in particular, of limiting appeals as of right from the District Courts to only the High Court (see the speech by the Minister for Law, Prof\u00a0S\u00a0Jayakumar (\u201cProf\u00a0Jayakumar\u201d), during the second reading of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill 1998 (Bill\u00a040 of 1998) (<i>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</i> (26\u00a0November 1998) vol\u00a069 at col\u00a01629); see also [19] above, where [13] of <i>Tan Chiang Brother\u2019s Marble</i> ([16] <i>supra</i>), which sets out the relevant part of Prof\u00a0Jayakumar\u2019s speech, is quoted in full), it is difficult to imagine that Parliament had intended s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA to cut down the one-tier right of appeal in admiralty actions without expressly providing for that. Moreover, there could conceivably be no reason for Parliament to do so. Other examples of actions in which there is a vested statutory right of appeal to the Court of Appeal, which entitlement would be affected by a literal reading of s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA, would be proceedings under the Companies Act (Cap\u00a050, 2006\u00a0Rev Ed) and the Trade Marks Act (Cap\u00a0332, 2005\u00a0Rev Ed) that are required to be commenced in the High Court. There is no reason why we should interpret s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA so as to blow away, by a side wind, a party\u2019s statutory right to appeal, without first obtaining the court\u2019s leave, to the Court of Appeal, which right previously vested (and still vests) in respect of (<i>inter alia</i>) the aforementioned types of actions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are of the view that this court\u2019s intellectual effort in characterising the subject matter of the action in <i>Hailisen Shipping Co Ltd</i> so as to avoid the clutches of s\u00a034(2)(</span><i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">a</span></i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">) of the 1999 SCJA was, with respect, wholly unnecessary. The Court of Appeal in that case could simply have decided the issue on the ground that s\u00a034(2)(</span><i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">a</span></i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">) of the 1999 SCJA had no application to any action commenced under the HCAJA. It would be contrary to Parliament\u2019s intention <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA if litigants in admiralty actions have no automatic right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. We note that, besides admiralty cases, there may be other situations where a plaintiff may be obliged to commence his claim in the High Court even though the monetary value of his claim falls below $250,000 (see [29] above). The present s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of the SCJA, on a strict literal reading of the words \u201cwhere the amount or value of the subject-matter at the trial is $250,000 \u2026 or less\u201d, would suggest that, in such cases (as well as in admiralty actions), there is no automatic right of appeal (<i>ie</i>, without first having to obtain the court\u2019s leave) to the Court of Appeal. In our view, however, if litigants in such actions are not entitled to appeal as of right to the Court of Appeal, it would (as in the case of admiralty actions (see [29] above)) be an affront to the principle that there should be one tier of appeal as of right in civil actions in Singapore. Unsuccessful litigants in such cases should be entitled to appeal as of right to the Court of Appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the above reasons, we are of the view that VM had to obtain the court\u2019s leave pursuant to s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) of SCJA before it filed the Notice of Appeal. It should have been clear to VM at the outset that leave to appeal was necessary, given that the copyright suit was commenced in the District Court and given that the appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision was subsequently heard and dismissed by the Judge in the High Court. Accordingly, the Notice of Appeal in this case is struck out.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Whether leave to appeal should be granted</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned earlier (see [1] above), VM has also made an application (<i>ie</i>, OS\u00a0561) for leave to appeal to this court against the Judge\u2019s decision. The principles governing the grant of leave to appeal are well-established. It suffices, for present purposes, to state that this court has established in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i> <nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 489</nobr> (\u201c<i>Lee Kuan Yew</i>\u201d) at [16] (and reaffirmed in <i>IW v IX</i> <nobr>[2006] 1 SLR 135</nobr>; see also <i>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</i></span> ([16] <i>supra</i>) at para\u00a057/16/14 and <i><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Singapore Court Practice 2006</span></i> ([16] <i>supra</i>) at para\u00a056/3/8<span lang=\"EN-AU\">) that there are three limbs which a party can rely upon when seeking leave to appeal (see [16] of <i>Lee Kuan Yew</i>):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]here are at least three limbs which can be relied upon when leave to appeal is sought: (1)\u00a0prima facie case of error; (2)\u00a0question of general principle decided for the first time; and (3)\u00a0question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In OS\u00a0561, VM relied on all three limbs to argue that leave to appeal should be granted to it. In respect of the first limb, VM, in its written submissions and at the hearing before us, spelt out the following list of errors alleged to have been made by the DJ and/or the Judge:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Judge and the DJ had asked the wrong legal question in determining if there was substantial copying of the copyright works after establishing that there were \u201cfingerprints\u201d of copying in VM\u2019s online maps;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Judge had failed to appreciate that VM\u2019s map-making process was completely different from the traditional map-making process described by SLA\u2019s expert, Mr\u00a0Calvert;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Judge had failed to appreciate that the online maps created by VM through the GPS survey (see [7] above) constituted an independent work, given the evidence before the court; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Judge had misconstrued the licence agreements.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, there is no merit in any of these allegations. The DC decision and the HC decision, respectively, have dealt with every one of these matters. The findings made by, respectively, the DJ and the Judge are well-reasoned and amply supported by the evidence before them. We are of the view that their findings are correct in law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the second and the third limbs for granting leave to appeal (as set out in <i>Lee Kuan Yew</i> at [16]) are concerned, VM argued that the alleged copying of the copyright works here constituted \u201caltered copying\u201d and not normal copying, and that the test of substantiality (the requirement of substantiality is prescribed in s\u00a010(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Copyright Act) in cases of \u201caltered copying\u201d was unsettled, given the different approaches to the requirement of substantiality that appeared to have been adopted by Lord\u00a0Millett and Lord\u00a0Scott of Foscote in the House of Lords decision of <i>Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd</i> [2000] 1\u00a0WLR 2416 (\u201c<i>Designers Guild Ltd</i>\u201d). In brief, Lord\u00a0Millett took the view (at 2426) that, in determining the requirement of substantiality:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The pirated part is considered <i>on its own</i> \u2026 and its importance to the copyright work assessed. <i>There is no need to look at the infringing work for this purpose.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Lord\u00a0Scott, on the other hand, was of the view that, for \u201caltered copying\u201d cases, the</span> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">similarities between the infringing work and the copyright work would actually be determinative of the question of substantiality (at 2430\u20132432). VM thus submitted that the test of substantiality for \u201caltered copying\u201d cases was a question of general principle of importance that should be decided by this court, as the final appellate court, in the public interest; accordingly, leave to appeal should be granted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAltered copying\u201d is essentially \u201ccopying with modifications\u201d (see, <i>inter alia</i>, <i>Designers Guild Ltd</i> at 2431 <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Scott), in contrast to the normal type of copying, where the alleged infringer simply selects a portion of the copyright work and copies it without significant alteration (see Sir\u00a0Hugh Laddie <i>et al</i>, <i>The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs</i> (Butterworths, 3rd\u00a0Ed, 2000) vol\u00a01 at para\u00a03.135 as well as <i>Designers Guild Ltd</i> at 2430\u20132431 <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Scott). In cases of \u201caltered copying\u201d, it is often said that the alleged infringer has created a work of his own, but, in so doing, he has made (see <i>The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs</i> vol\u00a01 at para\u00a03.135):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 an unfair and improper use of the claimant\u2019s work and has incorporated a substantial part thereof into his own, whether by way of disguising his copying, or saving himself the trouble of doing his own research, or otherwise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge, on appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision, noted in passing that \u201c[i]f there was any copying in the present case, it was \u2018altered\u2019 copying because VM\u2019s maps [were] not an exact replica of SLA\u2019s works\u201d (see the HC decision at [14]). However, it is crucial to note that the DJ had made a <i>finding of fact</i> at first instance that the nature of the copying here fell readily within <i>the usual or normal type</i> of copying (<i>viz</i>, where an identifiable part of the original work, but not the whole of it, has been copied), although she noted that such copying could <i>arguably</i> also be considered to be a form of \u201caltered copying\u201d <i>in certain respects</i>, as follows (see the DC decision at [54]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Although the approaches taken by Lord\u00a0Scott and Lord\u00a0Millett [in <i>Designers Guild Ltd</i>] differed in some respects, in that Lord\u00a0Scott, in determining the test of \u201csubstantiality\u201d, distinguished between the first type of copying where an identifiable part of the whole, but not the whole, has been copied and the second type of copying which he referred to as \u201caltered\u201d copying, suggesting that the test set out by Lord\u00a0Millett (ie, that once copying has been established, the question of substantiality depends on the relationship between what has been copied on the one hand and the original work on the other, and that whether the part taken is substantial must be determined by its quality rather than its quantity) would be suitable only in the first type of copying[,] [f]or the purposes of coming to my decision on this issue, it was not material which test I followed as the conclusion would be the same. <i>In any case, the nature of the copying by VM, if any, fell readily within the first type of copying articulated by Lord\u00a0Scott, as was the case in</i> Ladbroke (Football) Ltd <i>[</i>v William Hill (Football) Ltd <i>[1964] 1\u00a0WLR 273] (although it could arguably also be a form of \u201caltered copying\u201d in certain respects, such as [in] the shifting of the positions of the building polygons allegedly copied by VM in order to fit in with the altered positions of the roads in VM\u2019s allegedly infringing maps)</i>. Although I would not venture to suggest which approach (ie that of Lord\u00a0Millett or Lord\u00a0Scott) is preferred, I would agree with the authors of <i>The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs</i> (3<sup>rd</sup>\u00a0edition, 2000) at page\u00a0148, who submit that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 the test of infringement in the case of altered copying is, in principle, no different from any other kind. Has the infringer incorporated a substantial part of the independent skill, labour etc contributed by the original author in creating the copyright work, being skill or labour of a literary, dramatic or musical character? If so he has [reproduced] a substantial part.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, and contrary to VM\u2019s arguments, the present case was simply not one of \u201caltered copying\u201d. Although the Judge remarked, on appeal, that the nature of the copying done by VM was that of \u201caltered copying\u201d (see [37] above), it is apparent from a reading of the HC decision that he was, in fact, endorsing, <i>in full</i>, the DC decision (where the DJ had held that the present case was simply one involving <i>normal</i> copying (see [54] of the DC decision)). Accordingly, the question of general principle and/or the question of importance concerning the test of substantiality for \u201caltered copying\u201d cases as contended for by VM simply does not arise in the present proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, VM has not satisfied any of the limbs set out in <i>Lee Kuan Yew</i> ([32] <i>supra</i>) for granting a litigant leave to appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our opinion, the DJ, in her 130-page judgment, set out lucidly and in great detail her analysis of the evidence before her, as well as the findings which she made on the given evidence. She also comprehensively surveyed and considered the relevant and applicable authorities, and arrived at her decision after a careful and well-reasoned application of the law to the factual matrix before her. It is thus unsurprising that the Judge unreservedly endorsed her decision on appeal. As mentioned above (at [34]), we have also concluded above that there are no <i>prima facie</i> errors in both the DC decision and the HC decision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the above reasons, SLA\u2019s application in SUM\u00a02056 to strike out the Notice of Appeal is allowed with costs, and VM\u2019s application in OS\u00a0561 for leave to appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision is dismissed with costs.

Hence, the lease agreements with respect to the trust properties provided first for the trustees to try to obtain vacant possession through negotiations, failing which they would apply to the TCB for the requisite order. It would appear that the trustees considered that a period of two years (in cl\u00a01(1)) would be sufficient for them to obtain vacant possession of the premises by negotiating with the tenants or, alternatively, by obtaining an order from the TCB.</font></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, by 9\u00a0December 1998, when the rent became payable by the respondent, the then trustees were not able to get vacant possession of the trust properties for the respondent to begin redevelopment.

TKS replied on 22\u00a0January 2002 that the commencement date of the rent should be the date when vacant possession of the trust properties was given as the trust had contributed to the delay in obtaining the requisite planning approvals to redevelop the trust properties. On 28\u00a0January 2002, M&amp;N rejected the request and denied that the trust had caused the alleged delay. However, three days later, on 31\u00a0January 2002, M&amp;N sent a \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d letter to TKS making an offer to waive part of the arrears of rent for the period up to 31\u00a0December 1999, provided that all rents payable from 1\u00a0January 2000 onwards were paid within seven days from the date of the letter. In their \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d letter dated 6\u00a0February 2002, TKS agreed to the offer in relation to the Amoy Street property as the TOP had been obtained. In relation to the Purvis Street properties, TKS requested that the rent should start from December 2002 or the obtaining of the TOP, whichever came later.

The meaning of the expression \u201cnecessary business of the trust\u201d forms the main dispute in this case.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Was compromise agreement by sole trustee a breach of cl\u00a019?</font></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the appellants contended before the Judge that the sole trustee\u2019s agreement to enter into the compromise agreement to waive the accrued rent was in breach of cl\u00a019 as it was not a necessary business of the trust. \u00a0 Counsel argued that when cl 19 is read with cl\u00a012, the word \u201cnecessary\u201d in cl\u00a019 must limit the ambit of the words \u201cbusiness of the trust\u201d, otherwise the sole trustee would have the same powers as the joint trustees have under cl\u00a012. The testator could not have intended this since cl\u00a012 does not use the word \u201cnecessary\u201d. Under cl\u00a012 the joint trustees have the power to make \u201carrangements\u201d with tenants, which would include making compromises with tenants: see <i>Huddersfield Banking Company, Limited v Henry Lister &amp; Son, Limited</i> [1895] 2\u00a0Ch 273.\u00a0 Counsel contended that cl\u00a019 should be construed to have a narrower scope than cl\u00a012, and the word \u201cnecessary\u201d in the context connotes urgency, or a pressing need or a degree of compulsion. Counsel referred to <i>Pabari v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> [2005] 1\u00a0All ER 287, and <i>Regina\u00a0(Nilsen) v Governor of Full Sutton Prison</i> The Times, 2\u00a0January 2004 where the English courts have so construed the word \u201cnecessary\u201d. In the present case, there were no urgent circumstances that required the sole trustee to agree to the compromise. There was no evidence of any exigency, urgency, pressing need or compulsion for the sole trustee to waive the arrears of rent in the circumstances. Counsel also pointed out that the sole trustee appointed a co-trustee on 5\u00a0March 2002 just a few weeks after the compromise. There was no reason why he could not have waited until the new trustee was appointed so that the joint trustees could make the decision under cl\u00a012.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge rejected these arguments for the following reasons:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that the term \u201cnecessary business of the trust\u201d must be read in the context of the kind of business that the trust was engaged, which was to manage the trust properties for rent income for distribution to the income beneficiaries;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in this context, the term \u201cnecessary\u201d would imply the need to collect rent and how to deal with tenants who were in arrears, including the extent to which indulgence should be shown to a tenant in default;</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that since it has been conceded by the appellants (by failing to argue otherwise) that the sole trustee had authority to terminate the lease agreements and recover the trust properties, he would have authority to take action to recover all or only part of the rent; and</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that the meaning of the term \u201cnecessary\u201d was not limited to matters of urgency or pressing need, as otherwise the power would only be exercisable in very limited situations such as where the property was threatened with physical destruction.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Meaning of \u201cnecessary business of the trust\u201d in clause\u00a019</font></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this appeal, counsel for the appellants has repeated the same arguments made before the Judge. He further contended that the Judge\u2019s reliance on the omission of counsel for the appellants to argue that the sole trustee had no authority to terminate any tenancies as a reason to support her interpretation of cl\u00a019 was wrong as it was based on pure surmise as the appellants had not been asked that question, and if asked would have stated that cl\u00a019 did not authorise the sole trustee to terminate tenancies, except in cases of urgency or pressing need. Counsel also contended that in any event even if the sole trustee had power to recover arrears of rent or to terminate tenancies or to recover rent, it did not follow that he had power to enter into compromises to waive accrued rent.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the proper approach to determining the intention of the testator in using the words \u201call necessary\u201d to qualify the words \u201cbusiness of the trust\u201d in relation to the power given to the sole trustee in cl\u00a019 is to consider what the testator\u2019s purpose was in setting up the trust. It is clear from the terms of the will that he wanted to provide maintenance for his widow, children and grandchildren. To do this, he made his last will in 1934 in which he devised all his immovable properties situated in the Straits Settlements (\u201cthe settled property\u201d) on trustees to apply the net income from the rents and profits accruing to the settled property during \u201cthe period of the settlement\u201d (defined as the expiry of 20 years after the death of the last survivor of all his children and 22 named persons, many of whom were infants) for the maintenance of his widow, children and grandchildren. On the expiration of the settlement period, the settled property would be divided among the surviving income beneficiaries. To achieve this purpose, the testator directed his trustees to manage or superintend the management of the settled property with extensive powers to maintain and improve the settled property and to deal with them as if they were absolute owners thereof without being responsible for any loss but without power to grant any lease exceeding five years or to sell, mortgage or create any charge on the settled property.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clause 19 of the will also provided that there shall always be not less than two trustees but any vacancy in the trusteeship shall be filled up <i>as soon as conveniently may be</i> and a single trustee <i>if there be only one trustee</i> \u201cand\u201d (which can only mean \u201cor\u201d contextually) the executors or administrators of the last surviving trustee shall only have power to appoint new trustees and to carry on <i>all necessary business of the trust</i> until new trustees are appointed. It is apparent from the terms of cl\u00a019 that the sole trustee, if there be one, is not under an immediate duty to appoint new trustees as soon as there is a vacancy in the trusteeship. He is under a duty to do so as soon as conveniently may be, and this period of time may extend to allowing his personal representative to make the appointment. It therefore follows that a sole trustee may remain as such for a very long time. Under the general law, a trustee has certain duties in relation to the trust. In this case, the trustees\u2019 duties are to manage the settled property and apply the net income for the maintenance of the income beneficiaries during the settlement period. For this purpose, the trustees have been given wide powers under cl\u00a012. In our view, the sole trustee in the present case must have the same powers of management if he is to carry out his duty to apply the income from the settled property for the maintenance of the income beneficiaries. Such powers cannot be less extensive than those expressly given in cl\u00a012 to two trustees as the principal duty of a sole trustee is the same as that of two trustees. Such powers, as the Judge has pointed out, would include collecting and recovering accrued rent, terminating and granting tenancies, and doing all such acts as would ensure that there is a steady stream of income from the settled property for distribution to the income beneficiaries.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the powers given to the trustees in cl\u00a012 is \u201cto make allowances to or arrangements with tenants\u201d, a power which the appellants have acknowledged, includes making compromises with tenants. This is the power that the sole trustee in the present case had taken upon himself to exercise by waiving accrued rent amounting to $120,000 (for the Purvis Street properties from 9\u00a0December 1998 to 31\u00a0December 1999, excluding interest of about $99,663). The appellants\u2019 argument was that this could not be a necessary business of the trust as there was no urgency or pressing need to do so. The evidence showed that shortly after the compromise the sole trustee appointed another trustee. Accordingly, it was argued, there was no reason why the sole trustee could not have waited until the second trustee was appointed so that both of them could then decide whether or not to waive the rent pursuant to their powers under cl\u00a012 of the will.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge rejected this argument on the ground that the term \u201cnecessary\u201d was not limited to situations of urgency or pressing need or compulsion, having regard to the business of the trust. We agree with this interpretation. It does not seem sensible to us that in a trust of this nature that the power of the sole trustee (who may be in office for a very long time) under cl\u00a019 is limited to managing the settled property in times of urgency or pressing need. To discharge his duties diligently as a trustee in the present case, he has to do all things that are necessary to ensure that the trust is able to secure rental income from the settled property. The question of whether it is urgent or whether there is a pressing need to do so is secondary. In such situations, the sole trustee must exercise his management powers, but the power is not limited to such situations. Rather, the extent of the power is determined by what is in the interest of or for the benefit of the trust. In other words, the term \u201cnecessary\u201d in cl\u00a019 connotes the fulfilment of the object or purpose of the trust rather than the temporal conditions in which the power to carry on the business of the trust may be exercised. It may be noted that the words \u201call necessary\u201d qualify the business of the trust and not the exercise of the power to carry on the business of the trust. Clause\u00a019 empowers the sole trustee to do what is needed to be done to meet the object of providing maintenance for the income beneficiaries. In our view, the power to carry on all the necessary business of the trust includes doing what is <i>expedient</i> to meet the object or purpose of the trust.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the meaning of the term \u201call necessary business of the trust\u201d in cl\u00a019 must be understood, as the Judge has found (and which the appellants have not challenged), in the context of the kind of business that the trust was engaged, which was to manage the trust properties for rent income for distribution to the income beneficiaries. This means that cl\u00a019 was intended to allow the sole trustee to exercise his powers to do everything that would produce income for the benefit of the income beneficiaries from the letting out of the trust properties, as that is the business of the trust.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this interpretation, the relevant issue before the Judge and in this appeal is whether what the respondent did in this case was expedient for the purpose of carrying out the purpose of the trust. The appellants\u2019 case is that giving away trust money was detrimental to the trust and therefore could not be for the purpose of securing income to realise the object of the trust. We acknowledge that it appears counter-intuitive or contrary to common sense, or even irrational to suggest that waiving accrued rent can be a necessary business of the trust, when the object of the trust is to acquire revenue in the form of rentals from the settled property. This is not an unreasonable approach in considering the scope of the sole trustee\u2019s power under cl\u00a019. But it is not necessarily the best approach to carry on the necessary business of the trust which must, in our view, mean the realisation of the testator\u2019s intention in setting up the trust. We have earlier noted that this trust was intended to endure for a settlement period which may last a century to provide maintenance for beneficiaries who are still living during this period. To realise this object, the trust must be assured of a long, steady and stable stream of income from the settled property.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clause\u00a012 uses the word \u201cbusiness\u201d to describe the purpose of the trust. On this basis, if a business-like approach is adopted, the aim of the trustees must be to determine which course of action would be in the best interest of the trust. \u00a0 In February 2002, the sole trustee was faced with the dilemma as to whether to forgo immediately a part of the accrued rent in order to ensure that the trust properties were redeveloped at no cost to the trust and to enable it to collect a substantial rent of $13,000 per month for up to about 17 years, or to take court action to recover the accrued rent, but at the risk of losing the redevelopment and the rent if the respondent abandoned the redevelopment. He decided to adopt the former course in the honest belief that it was in the interest of the trust so as not to risk substantial loss of revenue to the trust which would have resulted in the cessation of maintenance to the income beneficiaries and being saddled with three uncompleted buildings for which he did not have the capital reserves to complete.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The present case concerns three rent-controlled properties belonging to the trust which the trustees have earlier agreed to lease to the respondent for a term of 20 years subject to two important conditions for the trust. The first was that the properties would be redeveloped by the respondent at their cost. The second was that the respondent would then pay a monthly rent of $13,000 for the properties for 20 years (which far exceeded the rentals payable by the existing protected tenants). Although there was no evidence before us as to the state of repair of the three properties, the redevelopment costs were estimated to be several million dollars which the trust could not have afforded. It should be recalled that under cl\u00a012, the trustees were prohibited from selling or mortgaging the settled property. Hence, from the point of view of the trust, this transaction was of great benefit to the long term interest of the trust and the income beneficiaries in the way of improving the value of the properties and increasing the rentals from them.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When cross-examined by the appellants\u2019 counsel on why he entered into the compromise agreement, the sole trustee explained that he was concerned about the respondent deciding to abandon the redevelopment of the trust properties if they were not given a waiver of part of the accrued rent to compensate them for the trustees\u2019 delay in giving vacant possession of the properties to the respondent to commence redevelopment works, and also his own delay in his inability to sign the necessary plans to obtain planning approval for the redevelopment. The sole trustee took the position that if he did not agree he would not be able to recover the accrued rent from the respondent (which had a paid up capital of $2) and that the trust would suffer considerable loss if the project were abandoned. In reply to the first point, the appellants have argued that the payment of the rent was guaranteed by the directors of the respondent and therefore the reason given by the sole trustee for waiving the rent was groundless. However, the appellants\u2019 response to the second reason was only that the waiver of the accrued rent was not in the interest of the trust and of the income beneficiaries.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the appellants\u2019 approach in considering only the immediate consequences of the compromise agreement is an overly narrow view of what the necessary business of the trust requires. It must be consonant with the object of this trust and more beneficial to it if the trustee were able to secure a stream of stable revenue from the settled property for as long as possible. The continuation of the arrangements under the lease agreements would secure this stream of revenue at a higher rate of return. Consider the consequences if the respondent had abandoned the project. The three properties were in an unfinished state. The trust did not have any capital funds (there was no evidence that it had) to complete the redevelopment. It would have had to borrow the funds to do so or to bring in another tenant who was prepared to complete the redevelopment. In the meantime, there would be no rental for some period of time, and even if or when rental becomes available, all of it would have to be utilised to repay the borrowings and the interest thereon. All in all, it is our view that entering into the compromise agreement was within the power of the sole trustee to carry on the necessary business of the trust as contemplated by cl\u00a019.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should also be noted that the appellants have not alleged that the sole trustee did not act in good faith in wanting to secure this stream of income for the trust at the lowest possible cost (except in relation to his explanation for not being able to recover the accrued rent from the respondent). In our view, he acted in good faith as he had received advice from his solicitors, M&amp;N, that he had the power to enter into the compromise agreement under cl\u00a019 of the will. He was faced with a situation where he had to make a decision to waive or not to waive part of the accrued rent and what the consequences could be if he decided not to do so. It might well be that his decision to waive was unwise, or was an error of \u00a0 judgment but it cannot be gainsaid that what he did achieved his aim of securing a long term stream of stable revenue from the redeveloped properties to the benefit of the trust and the income beneficiaries. In our view, the fact that that decision was or might have been questioned does not mean that he had no power to make that decision under cl\u00a019.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the reasons given above, we agree with the decision of the Judge that it was within the power of the sole trustee to carry on the necessary business of the trust pursuant to cl\u00a019 of the will to enter into the compromise agreement. Whether or not he exercised the power rightly or wrongly does not detract from the existence of the power. In light of this conclusion, there is strictly no need to consider the appellants\u2019 alternative argument that M&amp;N, the solicitors for the sole trustee who had made the offer to compromise with the respondent, did not have any ostensible authority to do so, and that therefore the appellants are not estopped from denying the validity of the compromise. However, since the appellants have made a submission on a point of law (based on the analogy of a company with a trust) which has not been argued before a Singapore court, we will, for the sake of completeness, give our reasons for rejecting it in the context of this case. But before doing so, we need to address the appellants\u2019 argument that the respondent had actual or constructive notice that the sole trustee acted in breach of trust and, therefore, they are not entitled to plead the compromise by way of estoppel against the appellants.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Did the respondent have actual or constructive notice of the breach of trust by the sole trustee?</font></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants\u2019 argument on this issue is that the sole trustee acted in breach of trust <i>because</i> he had no power to enter into the compromise agreement under cl\u00a019 and <i>not because</i> he had exercised it wrongly or negligently. Nevertheless, assuming that the sole trustee\u2019s decision was in breach of trust, did the respondent have actual or constructive notice of such breach? The Judge found, after a detailed analysis of the evidence, that the respondent did not have actual notice of the breach. There was no evidence that cl\u00a019 was drawn to the attention of the respondent\u2019s solicitors at the time of the signing of the lease agreements or that the respondent had ever been advised that the sole trustee had no power under cl\u00a019 to waive the accrued rent or that a possible construction of that clause might lead to the same result. We see no reason to disagree with the Judge on this finding, and in any case counsel for the appellants did not press the contrary before us.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the question of constructive notice, the Judge made no finding on this issue but observed that the appellants had cited no authority that constructive notice could nullify the respondent\u2019s reliance on M&amp;N\u2019s ostensible authority. She ruled that constructive knowledge could not be sufficient for this purpose as the only way of nullifying an apparent position was, logically, actual knowledge.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel argued that the respondent had constructive notice that the compromise was a breach of trust because a copy of the will had been registered in the land-register: see the decision of this court in <i>HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd v Lycee Francais De Singapour</i> <nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 24</nobr>, (\u201c<i>HSBC Trustee</i>\u201d). Counsel also referred to <i>Fairtitle v Gilbert</i> (1787) 2\u00a0TR 169; (1787) 29\u00a0ER 91; <i>HSBC Trustee</i> (<i>supra</i>); <i>Dance v Goldingham</i> [1873] LR 8\u00a0Ch App 902 and Ford on <i>Principles of the Law of Trusts</i> (Thomson Lawbook Co, Looseleaf Ed, 1996) at para\u00a017410 (March 2007 update) as authority for his submission that actual or constructive notice was sufficient to enable the appellants to set aside the compromise. It was further argued that the respondent\u2019s solicitors had constructive knowledge of cl\u00a019 because they had actual knowledge of cl\u00a012 of the will (since they had required the trustees to obtain court sanction to give the respondent a 20-year lease).</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, the parties dealt with each other through their solicitors. There was no reason why the respondent\u2019s solicitors should not assume that the sole trustee had the power to offer or accept the compromise and that, being advised by solicitors, he would not act in breach of trust or outside the terms of the Will. In fact, the evidence is that M&amp;N had advised the sole trustee that he had such power. In our view, even if the respondent\u2019s solicitors had constructive notice of cl\u00a019, it did not necessarily follow that they could be imputed with knowledge of the legal effect of cl\u00a019 which, as we have seen, is a provision of considerable ambiguity. Until this court has decided what its scope is, the parties cannot be expected to know what its legal effect is. We have not been cited any judicial decision or statement that has gone so far as to equate constructive notice of a clause in a will with the legal effect of that clause in a situation where the clause is vague or ambiguous and which requires a judicial decision to state its meaning and effect conclusively against a party relying on it. Counsel has cited no authority to show that the principle of constructive knowledge reaches that far.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Power and authority</font></em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This brings us to the argument on the scope of ostensible authority as a defence by way of estoppel. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the principle of law in agency relationships is that if A does not have any capacity or power to do X, A cannot give any authority to B to do X, and C who deals with B cannot plead that B has any ostensible authority on X. As authority for this principle, counsel referred to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer\u00a0 v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd</i> [1964] 2\u00a0QB 480 (\u201c<i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer</i>\u201d). In that case, it was held that an agent can only have apparent or ostensible authority to do an act that is within the capacity or power of the principal. In that case, the principal was a company and in the law of companies, if a company lacked capacity to perform an act (the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine), it could not be estopped from denying the validity of that act. Counsel argued this principle was applicable to a trust as a trust is analogous to a company in terms of its corporate structure with respect to its object and powers. So, in this case, if the sole trustee did not have the power under cl\u00a019 to waive the accrued rent, he could not hold out M&amp;N as having apparent or ostensible authority to enter into the compromise agreement with the respondent\u2019s solicitors. M&amp;N could not do what the sole trustee himself could not do.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is necessary to examine the facts in <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer.</i> There<i>,</i> the articles of association of the defendant company, BPP, contained a power empowering the board of directors to appoint a managing director. None was appointed, but K, a director, appointed a firm of architects, F&amp;L, to apply for planning permission to develop an estate and do certain other work. F&amp;L executed the work and claimed their fees from BPP. The Court of Appeal found that K had no actual authority to employ F&amp;L but had ostensible authority as he acted throughout as managing director to the knowledge of the board, and held, applying <i>Biggerstaff v Rowatt\u2019s Wharf Ltd</i> [1896] 2\u00a0Ch 93, and <i>British Thomson-Houston Company, Limited v Federated European Bank, Limited</i> [1932] 2\u00a0KB 176, that (a)\u00a0K\u2019s acts as managing director were within the ambit of the authority of a managing director and F&amp;L did not have to inquire whether he was properly appointed; and (b) it was sufficient for F&amp;L that under the articles of association there was in fact power to appoint him as such and accordingly BPP was liable for F&amp;L\u2019s fees.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diplock\u00a0LJ delivered an elaborate judgment in which he sought to clarify the confusing state of the law as to the ostensible authority of officers and servants to enter into contracts on behalf of corporations. Diplock\u00a0LJ said at\u00a0504:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Under the doctrine of ultra vires the limitation of the capacity of a corporation by its constitution to do any acts is absolute. This affects the rules as to the \u201capparent\u201d authority of an agent of a corporation in two ways. First, no representation can operate to estop the corporation from denying the authority of the agent to do so on behalf of the corporation an act which the corporation is not permitted by its constitution to do itself. Secondly, since the conferring of actual authority upon an agent is itself an act of the corporation, the capacity to do which is regulated by its constitution, the corporation cannot be estopped from denying that it has conferred upon a particular agent authority to do acts which by its constitution, it is incapable of delegating to that particular agent.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">To recognise that these are the direct consequences of the doctrine of ultra vires is, I think, preferable to saying that a contractor who enters into a contract with a corporation has constructive notice of its constitution, for the expression \u201cconstructive notice\u201d tends to disguise that constructive notice is not a positive but a negative doctrine, like that of estoppel of which it forms a part. It operates to prevent the contractor from saying that he did not know that the constitution of the corporation rendered a particular act or a particular delegation of authority ultra vires the corporation. It does not entitle him to say that he relied on some unusual provision in the constitution of the corporation if he did not in fact so rely.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">The second characteristic of a corporation, namely, that unlike a natural person it can only make a representation through an agent, has the consequence that in order to create an estoppel between the corporation and the contractor, the representation as to the authority of the agent which creates his \u201capparent\u201d authority must be made by some person or persons who have \u201cactual\u201d authority from the corporation to make the representation.\u00a0 Such \u201cactual\u201d authority may be conferred by the constitution of the corporation itself, as, for example, in the case of a company, upon the board of directors, or it may be conferred by those who under its constitution have the powers of management upon some other person to whom the constitution permits them to delegate authority to make representations of this kind.\u00a0 It follows that where the agent upon whose \u201capparent\u201d authority the contractor relies has no \u201cactual\u201d authority from the corporation to enter into a particular kind of contract with the contractor on behalf of the corporation, the contractor cannot rely upon the agent\u2019s own representation as to his actual authority.\u00a0 He can rely only upon a representation by a person or persons who have actual authority to manage or conduct that part of the business of the corporation to which the contract relates.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It may be noted that in <i>Walter Woon on Company Law</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 3rd Ed, 2005), the editor is of the view (see para\u00a03.87) that Diplock\u00a0LJ\u2019s statement may have little or no importance in the Singapore context since s\u00a025(1) of the Companies Act (Cap\u00a050, 2006 Rev Ed) has virtually abrogated the <i>ultra vires</i> principle. However, the question raised by the argument of counsel for the appellants is whether what is really a company law principle affecting <i>ultra vires</i> acts should be extended to a trust constituted by a trust instrument setting out the objects of the trust, the duties of trustees and the powers given to trustees to carry out the objects of the trust. Counsel\u2019s argument assumes that the principle established in <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer</i> is applicable to trustees for the reason that, just as the powers of directors of a company are determined by the articles of association, the powers of trustees are determined by the terms of the trust. Therefore, applying the principle in <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer,</i> by analogy, if the sole trustee did not have the power to waive the accrued rent, he could not authorise or hold out M&amp;N to do what he himself could not do. Accordingly, the appellants were not estopped from denying the validity of the compromise made by M&amp;N on behalf of the sole trustee.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attractive as counsel\u2019s argument may appear in terms of its structure and logic, we do not think that it helps the appellants in this case. Let us assume for the purposes of this argument\u00a0 that a trust is equivalent to a corporation in terms of its corporate structure, powers and authority, <i>ie</i>, (a)\u00a0the trust instrument is akin to the constitution of the corporation; (b)\u00a0the business of the trust is akin to the objects (business) of a corporation (which in turn would determine its capacity); (c)\u00a0the powers of the trustees are like the powers of the board of directors; and (d)\u00a0any agent to whom the trustees may delegate their duties is akin to the managing director and other officers of the corporation. In the present case, the business of the trust is the maintenance of the testator\u2019s widow, children and grandchildren for the settlement period of the trust which could last up to a hundred years, during which the trustees must manage the settled property to generate the revenue to carry out the business (or purpose) of the trust. The trustees have been given the power to manage the trust, just as the board of directors are given powers to manage the company. Again, just like the board of directors, when the number is less than the prescribed number, the trustees must fill the vacancies and, until it is done, they must carry on the business of the trust, just as a depleted board of directors has to carry on the business of the company.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So far the analogy between the legal structure of a company and that of a trust holds good. The legal structure of a trust is akin to that of a corporation in terms of objects and power and how the power is exercised. Just as, in practice, it is necessary for the board of directors to appoint a managing director, it is also sometimes necessary for the trustees to appoint an agent to look after certain functions of the trust. In the present case, the trustees (including a sole trustee) have such a power. Both the board and the trustees may be regarded as the primary organs of their respective bodies. However, whilst a depleted board has the power to carry on the business of the company and to exercise all the express or implied powers and authorities for this purpose, the sole trustee in the present case is given the power only to carry on the <i>necessary business of the trust</i>. Does this make a difference for the purposes of the principle in <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer</i>? We would say no. Even a limited power is still a power and there is no legal or policy reason why it should not operate in the same way or have the same effect for applying the principle of ostensible authority<i>.</i></font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We can carry the analogy further. Suppose in <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer,</i> the directors had passed a board resolution to appoint K as the managing director but lacked the requisite quorum to do so or the requisite period of notice had not been given. In such a situation, the managing director would still have ostensible authority to act as such as the board had actual authority to represent to third parties that the managing director had the power to act as such. Similarly, as the sole trustee in the present case is akin to the board in a company, his power to carry on the necessary business of the trust under cl 19 may be relied upon by the respondent as having represented that his solicitors, M&amp;N, had the power to offer the compromise to them.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We could take the argument further. If the appellants are entitled to rely on the principle based on the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine in <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer,</i> then the respondent in the present case should be allowed to rely on the indoor management rule (the rule in <i>Turquand</i>\u2019s case) to argue that what the sole trustee did was regular, <i>ie</i>, within his trust powers, unless they had actual notice of the irregularity. <i>Walter Woon on Company Law</i> (<i>supra</i>) has suggested, at para\u00a03.40, that the rule in <i>Turquand</i>\u2019s case should be applied together with the rules on apparent authority. The passage continues:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Although the doctrines developed separately, it is suggested that there is no reason why they should not be merged. The rule in <i>Turquand</i>\u2019s case should, in a modern context, be seen as a sub-set of the rules of apparent authority. In real life, people who deal with companies invariably assume that agents who appear to be authorized are in fact authorized. In the absence of anything to put a third party on notice, he is entitled to rely on the presumption of regularity. Any other rule would have a severely restrictive effect on real-life commercial transactions. A party dealing with a company does not know what the actual authority of its agent is. The actual authority of a company\u2019s agent is an internal matter. An outsider cannot easily find out what an agent\u2019s actual authority is. It is sufficient if the agent has apparent authority to do the acts in question. Persons dealing with the company in good faith are entitled to assume that acts within the apparent authority of its agent have been properly performed and need not inquire as to whether the agent\u2019s powers have been exercised or conferred regularly in compliance with all the prescribed formalities. As long as the agent has apparent authority, the fact that there is some internal irregularity that vitiates his actual authority does not matter.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Applying the indoor management rule, by way of analogy, it could be said that whether or not the waiver of the accrued rent was a necessary business of the trust was an internal decision for the sole trustee to make. It was a matter between him and the beneficiaries, and it was not for the respondent to enquire or concern himself with whether the waiver was a necessary business of the trust. The sole trustee had the power to so decide, even though it might have resulted in a breach. If he had the power to decide, he had the power to authorise M&amp;N to carry out his decisions. On the facts of this case, since the sole trustee did authorise M&amp;N to offer the compromise to the respondent, M&amp;N would have had actual authority to negotiate with the respondent.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Ostensible authority of M&amp;N</font></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This brings us to the issue of ostensible authority of M&amp;N as solicitors for the sole trustee. The question here is the apparent or ostensible authority of M&amp;N as seen by a third party dealing with them. Here, the third party was the respondent\u2019s solicitors. The law is well established on this issue. The Judge applied the principle in <i>Waugh v H\u00a0B\u00a0Clifford &amp; Sons Ltd</i> [1982] Ch 374 (and accepted as long established in</font> <a id=\"OLE_LINK1\" name=\"OLE_LINK1\"><i><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Harford v Birmingham City Council</font></i></a> <font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">(1993) 66\u00a0P\u00a0&amp;\u00a0CR 468) that in contentious matters a solicitor or counsel had ostensible or apparent authority to bind his client to a compromise of the action. She held that in the present case, the dispute had turned contentious as the appellants\u2019 solicitors had asserted a claim for the waived rent and the respondent\u2019s solicitors had rejected it. We agree with the Judge. It would be most inconvenient or impractical for the daily conduct of legal business if solicitors could not rely on the apparent authority of solicitors they have to deal with and every act or decision has to be supported by evidence of actual authority before an agreement between them could be reached on behalf of their clients. Indeed, in <i>Abacus Realty Pte Ltd v Indian Overseas Bank</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 1</nobr>, this court held that the ostensible authority of solicitors extended to non-contentious matters. At\u00a0[22], the court said:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">What Brightman\u00a0LJ [in <i>Waugh</i>\u2019s case] said of compromise negotiated and agreed to in litigation is equally apt and applicable to conveyancing or other non-contentious matters, where, daily, solicitors on behalf of their clients are engaged to settle the terms and conditions of agreements and other instruments in the absence of their clients\u00a0 [which was the case on our facts].\u00a0 The solicitors acting for a party on one side usually rely on and accept the terms and conditions or changes to the terms and conditions agreed to or communicated by the solicitors acting for the party on the other side and normally without any question of the existence of the requisite authority of the clients. It would be highly impracticable, if on each occasion when a solicitor agrees on behalf of his client to a new term or condition or any changes thereof, he has to produce authority from his client for such agreement.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the above reasons, if it were necessary to decide the issue of ostensible authority, we would hold that the respondent would be entitled to rely on the ostensible authority of M&amp;N to offer or accept the terms of the compromise agreement on behalf of the sole trustee, and the appellants cannot now deny its validity.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Validity of compromise and consideration</font></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next issue we have to address is whether the respondent had given consideration for the compromise, and if not, whether it was in any event, binding on the appellants.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the question of consideration, the Judge found on the evidence that the respondent believed that they had a claim against the trustees for breach of their obligations under the lease agreements, particularly the delay in obtaining vacant possession of the trust properties, and that the respondent gave up any right they had to claim damages in accepting the compromise offered by the sole trustee. The Judge (at\u00a0[42] of the judgment) distilled the principles in <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> (H\u00a0G\u00a0Beale gen ed)(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) at paras\u00a03-051 and 3-052 in the following terms:</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">[T]he compromise of a claim which is doubtful in law is binding as a contract and that this rule applies even if the claim is clearly invalid in law, so long as it was a reasonable claim which was in good faith believed by the party forbearing to have at any rate a fair chance of success.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants\u2019 case on the issue of compromise in this appeal is that (a)\u00a0the appellants were not a party to the compromise and therefore they were not bound by the compromise; and (b)\u00a0the compromise involved the sole trustee\u2019s breach of trust and therefore was not binding on the successor trustees, the appellants. In our view, these arguments have no merit. If the compromise was binding on the sole trustee, it was also binding on the successor trustees. On the question of the sole trustee\u2019s alleged breach of trust, we have found that the trustee believed that when he authorised M&amp;N to enter into the compromise on the accrued rent he was not acting in breach of trust as M&amp;N had advised him that it was within his power to do so. In this regard, we note that there is no evidence that the respondent was actually aware that the compromise was a breach of cl\u00a019 of the will.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">Waiver and estoppel</font></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The final issue is whether the appellants were estopped from claiming the waived rent. The Judge referred to the line of cases starting from the well-known decisions of <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Company</i> (1877) 2\u00a0App Cas 439 and <i>Central London Property Trust Limited v High Trees House Limited</i> [1947] KB 130 that had held that in equity, a promise by a contracting party not to enforce his strict legal rights has a limited effect provided that certain conditions are met. In so far as such promise relates to an agreement by a creditor to accept a lesser sum in settlement of a debt due to him, these are as follows: (a)\u00a0there must be a representation by the creditor that he will not enforce his strict legal right to full payment; (b)\u00a0there must be a reliance by the debtor on the representation; and (c)\u00a0there must be circumstances which make it inequitable for the creditor to go back on his promise. On the evidence, the Judge found that all the three conditions were fulfilled in the present case.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In her grounds of decision, the Judge also considered the ongoing debate in academic circles on the scope of the third condition, <i>viz</i>, whether detriment is necessary in all cases of promissory estoppel (the \u201cnarrow view\u201d) or if it would suffice to show \u201ccircumstances that make it inequitable for the creditor to go back on his promise (\u201cbroad view\u201d). The Judge preferred the broad view, which is also advocated by <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> (below) and <i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England</i> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">vol\u00a016(2) (LexisNexis UK, 4th Ed, 2003 Re-issue) at para\u00a01086).</span> The Judge\u2019s observations at\u00a0[44] of the judgment merit reproduction.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">As for the third element, there has been <i>some discussion</i> as to whether there must be \u201cdetriment\u201d suffered by the debtor before the creditor is estopped from going back on his promise<span lang=\"EN-AU\">.\u00a0 In this respect, <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> at para 3-135, asserts that the better view is that detriment of the kind required for the purpose of estoppel by representation is not an essential requirement and all that is necessary is that the promisee should have <i>acted in reliance on the promise in such a way as to make it inequitable to allow the promisor to act inconsistently with it</i>.

It is therefore not necessary for us to enter into this controversy without the benefit of arguments to the contrary.</font></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the appellants did raise two issues in connection with the application of the law in relation to the facts. First, it was argued that the representations were made by M&amp;N who were</span> the solicitors for the sole trustee and not for the appellants as pleaded by the respondent. Since the appellants did not make the representations, they could not be bound by any estoppel that the representation might have given rise to. Second, the appellants argued that promissory estoppel, unlike proprietary estoppel, does not bind third parties, such as the appellants.</font></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><font face1=\"Times New Roman, Times\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, these arguments have no merit.

court):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This appeal concerned the enforcement of a judgment (the \u201cAustralian judgment\u201d), given by the Supreme Court of Western Australia in favour of the respondent casino, Burswood Nominees Ltd (\u201cBurswood\u201d), for its claim on, <i>inter alia</i>, a dishonoured cheque issued by the appellant, Liao Eng Kiat (\u201cLiao\u201d). The Singapore High Court allowed registration of the Australian judgment here. Liao failed to have the registration set aside, and appealed. We dismissed Liao\u2019s appeal and now give our reasons.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Background facts</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Burswood operated a licensed casino in Perth, Western Australia. Liao was a regular visitor to the Burswood casino. Depending on his turnover at the casino tables, Burswood provided Liao with various perks, such as reimbursement of his airfare and hotel and food expenses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On or around 19\u00a0November 1997, Liao flew to Perth and checked into Burswood\u2019s hotel. The next day, he utilised Burswood\u2019s cheque cashing facility (\u201cCCF\u201d) to buy a chip purchase voucher. Essentially, the CCF allowed Liao to issue a personal cheque to the casino in exchange for a voucher of equivalent value. Liao issued a cheque for S$52,900 and was given a voucher of A$50,000 in return. Liao then exchanged this voucher for A$50,000 worth of gambling chips, which he proceeded to lose entirely at the gambling tables.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Liao\u2019s personal cheque was dishonoured upon presentation. He did not deny his liability to repay the debt to Burswood, but asked for an extension to settle the outstanding amount.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After three years had passed and Liao had failed to make any payment to Burswood, Burswood sued upon the dishonoured cheque in the District Court of Western Australia. On 13\u00a0December 2001, after Liao\u2019s failure to enter an appearance, Burswood obtained a default judgment against him for the sum of A$78,331.50 (the \u201cjudgment sum\u201d) with costs of A$2,765.28. For purposes of registration, s\u00a0142 of the Supreme Court Act 1935 (Western Australia) deems the decision of the District Court of Western Australia to be a judgment of the Supreme Court of Western Australia.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In August 2003, Burswood successfully applied for registration of the Australian judgment in the Singapore High Court under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap\u00a0264, 1985\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cRECJA\u201d). Two months later, Liao took out an application before an assistant registrar by way of summons in chambers to set aside the registration. He failed and appealed to the High Court, where his appeal was dismissed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Legislation and case law</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Legislation</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two pieces of legislation were central to this appeal. The first was s\u00a05 of the Civil Law Act (Cap\u00a043, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cCLA\u201d), which states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All contracts or agreements, whether by parol or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering shall be null and void.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No action shall be brought or maintained in the court for recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to be won upon any wager or which has been deposited in the hands of any person to abide the event on which any wager has been made.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second piece of legislation was s\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA, which provides:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">No judgment shall be ordered to be registered under this section if the judgment was in respect of a cause of action which for reasons of public policy or for some other similar reason could not have been entertained by the registering court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Case law</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The case of <i>Star City Pty Ltd v Tan Hong Woon</i> <nobr>[2002] 2 SLR 22</nobr> (\u201c<i>Star City</i>\u201d) was of particular importance in the course of our deliberations. As this judgment will make frequent reference to <i>Star City</i>, it is appropriate to deal with it in some detail at the outset.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The facts of <i>Star City</i> are as follows. The plaintiff casino, located in Sydney, had a CCF that worked on largely the same premises as Burswood\u2019s CCF. The defendant in <i>Star City</i> had handed five cheques to the casino in exchange for a chip purchase voucher, which was then changed for gambling chips. The defendant\u2019s cheques were dishonoured for lack of sufficient funds, and the casino sued in the Singapore High Court to recover the money as an unpaid loan made to the defendant. The defendant contended that the transaction was a gaming contract, and that as such, s\u00a05 of the CLA debarred the casino from bringing an action to recover the moneys owed to it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the High Court, Tan Lee Meng\u00a0J dismissed the casino\u2019s claim: <i>Star City Pty Ltd v Tan Hong Woon</i> <nobr>[2001] 3 SLR 206</nobr>. He observed that s\u00a05(2) of the CLA barred our courts from adjudicating any action to recover money alleged to have been won upon any wager, regardless of whether the gambling took place in Singapore or abroad. After a detailed consideration of the case law, he decided that the action was one for money won upon a wager. Accordingly, s\u00a05(2) of the CLA relieved the court from having to deal with the casino\u2019s claim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons which will be particularised later in this judgment, we agreed with Tan\u00a0J\u2019s decision after hearing the casino\u2019s appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this juncture, it suffices to note that the facts of the present case differed from those of <i>Star City</i> in one essential aspect. In <i>Star City</i>, the casino brought a fresh claim for the money on the dishonoured cheque in the Singapore courts. In the present case, however, Burswood had already obtained a judgment on the dishonoured cheque in the Australian court, and sought registration of the Australian judgment in Singapore. Registration will not be ordered if the appellant is able to establish any one of the limited number of exceptions in s\u00a03(2) of the RECJA. The principal issue canvassed on appeal was whether s\u00a05(2) of the CLA and s\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA precluded registration of the Australian judgment on grounds of public policy. We now lay out our analysis of this issue in three stages.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Stage\u00a01: Characterisation of the claim</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is settled law that whilst s\u00a05(1) of the CLA only renders the original wagering or gaming contract null and void, s\u00a05(2) strikes down as unenforceable all other contracts to pay the sum won upon a wager. As we pointed out in <i>Star City</i>, the success of the casino\u2019s claim depended on the characterisation of the transaction in question. If the transaction was characterised as a loan, the action on the loan itself would succeed as long as the loan was valid under its governing law. In contrast, if the court characterised the transaction as an action to recover money won upon a wagering contract, s\u00a05 of the CLA would preclude recovery of the money.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, the trial judge found that the principal judgment sum was a loan given by Burswood to Liao to enable Liao to gamble at the casino. Liao challenged this finding, asserting that the sum claimed by Burswood under the dishonoured cheque was for money won upon a wager.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In turn, Burswood sought to obviate this problem by persuading us that we were not free to re-characterise Burswood\u2019s claim. Instead, Burswood said that we should limit ourselves to the causes of action contained in the Australian judgment. In other words, this court should only consider whether the original causes of action based on dishonour of a cheque and breach of the CCF were against Singapore public policy. We had no difficulty dismissing this argument. We were of the opinion that we were entitled to look beyond the technical causes of action before the Australian court to the context in which these causes of action arose when deciding whether s\u00a03(2)(f) should apply to preclude registration of the Australian judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Burswood argued that the handing over of the cheque pursuant to the CCF was simply a payment for a voucher. The wager itself only took place when the gambling chips exchanged for the voucher were used at the gambling tables. Liao, on the other hand, drew our attention to the affidavit testimony of a credit manager at Burswood\u2019s casino, Mr\u00a0Roger Lewis. Mr\u00a0Lewis testified that the CCF is not a credit facility and that s\u00a021 of the Casino (Burswood Island) Agreement prohibits the giving of loans to patrons. We were of the opinion that Mr\u00a0Lewis\u2019 characterisation of the CCF was not determinative of its actual characterisation in law. Rather, as we held in <i>Star City</i> at [38], the \u201coverriding test\u201d when determining whether to characterise a claim as a loan or a gaming debt must be \u201cthe essence of the transaction itself as determined by the courts of the forum\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Burswood contended that its CCF could be distinguished from the facility offered in <i>Star City</i> because the casino in <i>Star City</i> required that the cheque remain uncashed for ten days, whereas Burswood did not lay down a similar requirement. We were not swayed by this argument. As we noted at [36] of <i>Star City</i>, the requirement that cheques presented under the casino\u2019s CCF remain uncashed for ten days only served as \u201ca deferred form of payment to give gamblers time to ensure that they have sufficient funds to repay their gambling losses in their bank accounts\u201d. This did not change the fact that the CCF\u2019s sole purpose was to enable patrons to gamble on credit, and that chips obtained via the CCF and placed on the gaming tables merely represented the moneys paid in advance by the gamblers to the casino by their cheques. We did not think that the absence of a requirement that Liao\u2019s cheque should remain uncashed for a certain period of time was so significant as to alter the entire nature of the transaction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In reaching our decision that the CCF in <i>Star City</i> was not a loan facility, we noted several features of the CCF, namely that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the chips were worthless outside the casino;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no moneys were ever advanced by the casino, which merely gave the gambler the right to play at the tables upon presentation of his cheques; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any moneys lost were made good by the gambler and not the casino.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We observed that these same features were present in Burswood\u2019s CCF, which was further indication that the object of the CCF was to enable patrons to gamble on credit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We disagreed with the trial judge\u2019s reasoning that her characterisation of the transaction might have been different had the sequence of events been reversed, such that instead of first issuing a cheque in exchange for gambling chips, Liao had issued a cheque as payment for gambling losses which he had already incurred. We did not think that such a distinction was material to the characterisation of the issue. As we noted at [37] of <i>Star City</i>:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[W]hat would a gambler want with the chips except to use them for gambling and gambling alone? A broad view of things must be taken, and this points towards the cheques being used to pay for the gaming chips and any money to be recovered by the casinos as money won/lost upon a wager rather than a true loan \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the foregoing reasons, we determined that Burswood\u2019s claim on Liao\u2019s dishonoured cheque was for money won upon a wager.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Stage\u00a02: Section\u00a05(2) of the CLA</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This resolution of the first issue left no question that s\u00a05(2) of the CLA would have prevented Burswood from recovering the money under Liao\u2019s dishonoured cheque had Burswood\u2019s claim been brought in a Singapore court in the first instance. The question that followed was whether s\u00a05(2) would apply where Burswood\u2019s claim had been brought and adjudicated upon in a foreign court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, the analysis proffered by Liao was as follows. Section\u00a05(2) of the CLA would have barred the Singapore courts from entertaining Burswood\u2019s action to recover the money due under the dishonoured cheque. An exception to registration under s\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA is where a foreign judgment was \u201cin respect of a cause of action which for reasons of public policy or for some other similar reason <i>could not have been entertained by the registering court</i>\u201d [emphasis added]. Since the Australian judgment was in respect of a cause of action which for reasons of public policy could not have been entertained by the registering court in Singapore under s\u00a05(2) of the CLA, s\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA would preclude registration of the Australian judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For reasons that we will elaborate upon in the next portion of this judgment, we found that this argument was misconceived. In our evaluation, s\u00a05(2) of the CLA and s\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA encapsulate different standards of the public policy defence. While s\u00a05(2) of the CLA elucidates Singapore\u2019s domestic public policy on the enforcement of gambling debts, a rule of our public policy as it applies to registration of foreign judgments under the statute in question is clearly different. Section\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA requires a higher threshold of public policy to be met in order for registration of a foreign judgment to be refused. As such, we could not countenance Liao\u2019s attempt to get around s\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA by arguing that s\u00a05(2) of the CLA would have precluded this court from entertaining Burswood\u2019s cause of action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Stage\u00a03: Section\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the crucial issue in the present case was whether registration of the Australian judgment was contrary to public policy considerations under s\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA. Counsel for both parties were unable to point us to any local cases dealing specifically with this issue. It is thus appropriate to begin with the approach taken by foreign courts in some detail.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The approach of foreign courts</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Foreign courts have repeatedly emphasised that a high standard of public policy must be met before they will refuse to enforce a foreign judgment. The outcome of this approach has been that there are very few reported cases in which foreign judgments <i>in personam</i> have been denied enforcement or recognition for reasons of public policy, as noted by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Soleimany v Soleimany</i> <nobr>[1999] QB 785</nobr> at 795.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, the English courts have held that the doctrine of public policy \u201cshould only be invoked in clear cases in which the harm to the public is substantially incontestable, and does not depend upon the idiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds\u201d: <i>Fender v St John-Mildmay</i> <nobr>[1938] AC 1</nobr> at 12. More significantly, the House of Lords accepted in <i>Vervaeke v Smith</i> <nobr>[1983] 1 AC 145</nobr> at 164 that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he court will be even slower to invoke public policy in the field of conflict of laws than when a purely municipal legal issue is involved. There is little authority for refusing, on the ground of public policy, to recognise an otherwise conclusive foreign judgment \u2013</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">no doubt because the conclusiveness of a judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction is itself buttressed by the rule of public policy, interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium, the \u201ccommonwealth\u201d in conflict of laws extending to the whole international community. Nevertheless, there is some judicial authority that the English court will in an appropriate case refuse on the ground of public policy to accord recognition to the judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction \u2026 Although an English court will exercise such a jurisdiction with <i>extreme reserve</i>, \u2026 the instant is a case where it should be invoked \u2026 [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In like vein, although public policy in many United States jurisdictions debars the enforcement of gambling debts, these jurisdictions have largely concluded that they are required to honour gambling judgments rendered by sister states. In <i>Fauntleroy v Lum</i> 210\u00a0US 230 (1908), the US Supreme Court required the Mississippi courts to honour a judgment on a gambling debt from the Missouri courts even though the enforcement of such debts was specifically prohibited in Mississippi. We recognised that since these cases involved judgments from sister states, their outcome was contingent on the full faith and credit clause of the US Constitution, which requires that full faith and credit be given to the public acts and judicial proceedings of other states.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, the vast majority of American courts have also shown a willingness to enforce judgments emanating from other countries, even though the full faith and credit clause does not apply to such foreign judgments. The American courts have interpreted the public policy exception very narrowly, their attitude encapsulated in the famous statement of Cardozo\u00a0J in <i>Loucks v Standard Oil Co of New York</i> 224\u00a0NY 99 (1918) at 111:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We are not so provincial as to say that every solution of a problem is wrong because we deal with it otherwise at home. \u2026 The courts are not free to refuse to enforce a foreign right at the pleasure of the judges, to suit the individual notion of expediency or fairness. They do not close their doors unless help would violate <i>some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This approach was illustrated in <i>Aspinall\u2019s Club Limited v Eskander Aryeh</i> 86\u00a0AD\u00a02d 428 (1982), where a licensed London casino obtained a default judgment from an English court against a New York debtor. Even though the full faith and credit clause did not apply, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York enforced the English judgment, explaining at 434 that \u201c[g]ambling in legalized and appropriately supervised forms is not against this State\u2019s public policy\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likewise, the Canadian courts have evinced a reluctance to refuse recognition of foreign judgments. In <i>Boardwalk Regency Corp v Maalouf</i> (1992) 88\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 612, the Ontario Court of Appeal was faced with a New Jersey judgment on a dishonoured cheque written to cover gambling debts. The Ontario Court of Appeal noted that, thus far, Ontario courts had generally refused to allow the recovery of foreign gambling debts on the grounds of public policy. It nevertheless went on to enforce the foreign judgment, saying (at 616 and 618):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where the foreign law is applicable, Canadian courts will generally apply that law even though the result may be contrary to domestic law. Professor Castel\u2019s discussion [in <i>Canadian Conflict of Laws</i> (2nd\u00a0Ed, 1986)] of public policy regarding the application of foreign law or the enforcement of a foreign judgment is helpful in this respect (para\u00a091, pp\u00a0153-9):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the conflict of laws, public policy must connote more than local policy as regards internal affairs.</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is true that internal and external public policy stem from the national policy of the forum but they differ in many material respects. Rules affecting public policy and public morals in the internal legal sphere need not always have the same character in the external sphere. <i>Also, there should be a difference of intensity in the application of the notion of public policy depending upon whether the court is asked to recognize a foreign right or legal relationship or to create or enforce one based on some foreign law.</i> Public policy is relative and in conflicts cases represents a national policy operating on the international level.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If foreign law is to be refused any effect on public policy grounds, it must at least violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, or some deep-rooted tradition of the forum \u2026</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The ethics or morality of licensed gambling abroad, and the recovery of gambling debts incurred in jurisdictions where gambling is legal, are best left to a community standard. There is nothing to indicate that the general Canadian public would be offended by the enforcement of foreign judgments for debts incurred in jurisdictions where commercial gambling is licensed and legal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A survey of these cases made it apparent that there is a higher standard of public policy in operation when a forum court is faced with a foreign judgment, as opposed to a domestic issue being litigated for the first time in the forum court. Foreign courts appear very reluctant to invoke the expedient of \u201cpublic policy\u201d to justify a refusal to recognise a foreign judgment, even if their domestic public policy would have precluded enforcement of the underlying claim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Arbitration cases</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for Burswood drew our attention to several arbitration cases where the courts manifested the same reluctance to rely on public policy grounds to refuse recognition of foreign awards.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The relevant legislative provision in all these cases was Art V(2)(b) of the New York Convention for the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (\u201cthe New York Convention\u201d), which allows the court to refuse enforcement of a foreign arbitral award if \u201cenforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of [the forum] country\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Re\u00a0An Arbitration between Hainan Machinery Import and Export Corporation and Donald &amp; McArthy Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 34</nobr>, our High Court was asked to enforce a foreign arbitration award pursuant to the New York Convention. Judith Prakash\u00a0J held at 46, [45] that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he principle of comity of nations requires that the awards of foreign arbitration tribunals be given due deference and be enforced unless <i>exceptional circumstances</i> exist. As a nation which itself aspires to be an international arbitration centre, Singapore must recognise foreign awards if it expects its own awards to be recognised abroad. <i>I could see no exceptional circumstances in this case which would justify the court in refusing to enforce the award \u2026</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas Co, Inc v Societe Generale de l\u2019Industrie du Papier (RAKTA)</i> 508\u00a0F\u00a02d 969 (1974) at 974, the US Court of Appeal noted that the public policy limitation in the New York Convention is to be construed narrowly and applied only where \u201cenforcement would violate the forum state\u2019s most basic notions of morality and justice\u201d. The court also differentiated between domestic and \u201cinternational\u201d public policy, saying that it would seriously undermine the utility of the New York Convention if its public policy defence were to be read as a \u201cparochial device\u201d protective only of national political interests.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This stance was followed by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <i>Hebei Import &amp; Export Corp v Polytek Engineering Co Ltd (No\u00a02)</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 HKC 192</nobr> at 206\u2013207:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The test we would therefore adopt is: whether in all the circumstances of the case, it would violate the most basic notions of morality and justice of the Hong Kong system if the foreign award in question is to be enforced.</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">The cases in which the court would come to such a conclusion would not be \u2026 very common. We would be slow to condemn what happened before an arbitration tribunal in a foreign jurisdiction as having violated the most basic notions of morality and justice of our system unless it is quite clearly the case. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In similar vein, the Supreme Court of India observed in <i>Renusagar Power Co Ltd v General Electric Co</i> AIR\u00a0 1994 SC\u00a0860 at [51] that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A distinction is drawn while applying the said rule of public policy between a matter governed by domestic law and a matter involving conflict of laws.</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The application of the doctrine of public policy in the field of conflict of laws is more limited than that in the domestic law and the courts are slower to invoke public policy in cases involving a foreign element than when a purely municipal legal issue is involved.</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We recognised that all four cases dealt with the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. Nevertheless, we agreed with counsel for Burswood that the same public policy requirements that apply to the enforcement of international arbitral awards should apply to enforcement of foreign judgments under the RECJA. Both the New York Convention and the RECJA were enacted with the basic aim of removing pre-existing obstacles to the enforcement of foreign awards or judgments. A narrow reading of the public policy defence would help to further this aim. Above all, considerations of reciprocity that underlie both the New York Convention and the RECJA enjoin courts to invoke the public policy defence with caution.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We pause here to iterate the point that the statutory regime in question is based on reciprocal treatment of the judgments of the High Court and the Court of Appeal of Singapore on the one hand, and corresponding courts of other countries within the Commonwealth on the other. Specifically, the Minister by gazette notification S\u00a0383/93 extended the application of the RECJA to judgments of the Supreme Court of Western Australia after being satisfied that reciprocal provisions had been made by the State Legislature of Western Australia for the enforcement of judgments obtained in the High Court and the Court of Appeal of Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For these reasons, we concurred with Burswood\u2019s submissions that public policy in the conflict of laws operates with less vigour than public policy in the domestic law. As such, we determined that Liao would have to surmount the higher public policy threshold in order to prevail upon us to refuse registration of the Australian judgment on grounds of public policy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Whether registration of the Australian judgment was against public policy</em></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It remained for us to decide whether our domestic public policy, which has thus far seen our courts set their face against the enforcement of gambling debts, is so important as to form part of the core of essential principles of justice and morality shared by all nations, thus raising it to the level of \u201cinternational\u201d public policy. We were not so persuaded.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, the various cases discussed earlier in this judgment indicate quite clearly that other nations do not view the recognition of foreign judgments on gambling debts as being against fundamental principles of justice and morality. In this regard, we also considered the Malaysian case of <i>The Aspinall Curzon Ltd v Khoo Teng Hock</i> <nobr>[1991] 2 MLJ 484</nobr> (\u201c<i>The Aspinall</i>\u201d). In <i>The Aspinall</i>, the plaintiff casino obtained an English judgment against the defendant and applied to the High Court of Kuala Lumpur to have the judgment registered. The defendant argued that the English judgment was for a gambling debt and should not be enforced as it was against public policy. The judge disagreed and recognised the judgment, noting at 486 that public policy was an \u201cunruly horse\u201d which was \u201cnever argued at all but only when other points fail\u201d. We observed that s\u00a026 of the Malaysian Civil Law Act 1956 is <i>in pari materia</i> with s\u00a05(2) of the CLA, and that s\u00a05(1)(a)(v) of Malaysia\u2019s Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act provides a defence to the recognition of a foreign judgment if enforcement of the judgment is contrary to Malaysia\u2019s public policy. In our considered opinion, Liao\u2019s attempts to distinguish <i>The Aspinall</i> based on a comparison of the relevant statutory provisions were weak, and we did not find that the minor differences in the language of the provisions affected the outcome of the case in any way.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, we observed in <i>Star City</i> ([9] <i>supra</i>) at [30] and [31] that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Singapore] now recognises that gambling can be permitted for its entertainment value if it is strictly controlled and regulated by the relevant authorities. Gambling per se is no longer considered to be contrary to the public interest and this accounts for the various forms of legalised gaming and gambling which currently [exist] in Singapore \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">However, what is objectionable is courts being used by casinos to enforce gambling debts disguised in the \u2018form\u2019 of loans. Valuable court time and resources that can be better used elsewhere are wasted on the recovery of such unmeritorious claims. The machinery of the courts cannot be used indirectly to legitimise the recovery of moneys won upon wagers overseas when similar relief would be refused for moneys won upon wagers in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we recognised two years ago, gambling <i>per se</i> is not contrary to the public interest in Singapore. To date, the stand we took in <i>Star City</i> has been bolstered by the fact that Singapore\u2019s societal attitudes towards gambling have evolved even further, as evinced by the fact that the Government is giving serious consideration to the idea of building a casino on the island of Sentosa. In this respect, we found this passage from <i>Intercontinental Hotels Corporation (Puerto Rico) v Golden</i> 15\u00a0NY\u00a02d 9 (1964) at 14\u201315 instructive:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Public policy is not determinable by mere reference to the laws of the forum alone. Strong public policy is found in prevailing social and moral attitudes of the community. \u2026 It seems to us that, if we are to apply the strong public policy test to the enforcement of the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the gambling laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, we should measure them by the prevailing social and moral attitudes of the community which is reflected not only in the decisions of our courts in the Victorian era but sharply illustrated in the changing attitudes of the People of the State of New York. The legalization of pari-mutuel betting and the operation of bingo games, as well as a strong movement for legalized off-track betting, indicate that the New York public does not consider authorized gambling a violation of \u201csome prevalent conception of good morals (or), some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal.\u201d\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We did not think that there were any public policy grounds militating against registration of the Australian judgment which would offend a fundamental principle of justice or a deep-rooted tradition of Singapore. Neither did we have any evidence before us to indicate that the general community in Singapore would be offended by the registration of a foreign judgment on a gambling debt that was incurred in a licensed casino. If anything, we were of the opinion that the prevalent conception of good morals in the Singaporean community at large would be against Singaporeans who ran up gambling debts in overseas jurisdictions and sought to evade their responsibility for those debts when judgment had been issued against them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus far, the focus of this judgment has been on the public policy exception laid down in s\u00a03(2)(f) of the RECJA. However, we also think it apt to mention another provision of the RECJA which was neglected by counsel for both parties but which we found relevant to the resolution of this case \u2013 s\u00a03(1) of the RECJA. Whilst s\u00a03(2) of the RECJA lays down various restrictions on the court\u2019s power to order the registration of foreign judgments, s\u00a03(1) of the RECJA gives the court the general discretion to order the registration of a foreign judgment if \u201cin all the circumstances of the case [the court] thinks it is <i>just and convenient</i> that the judgment should be enforced in Singapore\u201d [emphasis added]. In our assessment, Liao had failed signally in his attempt to show that it was not just and convenient for us to register the Australian judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances of this case, we did not think that registration of the Australian judgment raised serious issues of morality, or that it offended against an essential public interest in Singapore. We therefore ruled that Burswood was entitled to the registration of the Australian judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Decision\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Appeal

lang=\"EN-GB\">Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us are two cross-appeals lodged by both the plaintiffs and the defendant against the assessment of damages made by the High Court (reported at <nobr>[2005] 2 SLR 302</nobr>) pursuant to an earlier decision of this court (\u201cthe first appeal\u201d) where we held that the defendant was liable to the plaintiffs for damages for breach of contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ten plaintiffs sued on their own behalf as well as on behalf of another 4,885 persons named in a schedule to the Amended Statement of Claim pursuant to O\u00a015 r\u00a012(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2004\u00a0Rev Ed). All the 4,895 plaintiffs are founder members of the Raffles Town Club (\u201cRTC\u201d or \u201cthe Club\u201d as may be appropriate), a proprietary club owned by the defendant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The full facts of the case giving rise to the action were set out in our judgment in the first appeal reported at <nobr>[2003] 3 SLR 307.</nobr> We held that in the light of the representations made in the promotional material which the defendant despatched to the plaintiffs, it was an implied term of the contract that the defendant would deliver to the plaintiffs a premier club and it had failed to do so. Instead, the defendant admitted a large number of people, totalling some 19,000, as members. At all material times, the plaintiffs were ignorant of the total number of persons who had become members of RTC.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in March 2000 when the Club opened its premises to members, there was a tremendous squeeze on its facilities. Even then, the plaintiffs did not know what was the exact cause. When queried, the chief operating officer of the defendant said that there were about 7,000 members. It was only in March 2001, in an unrelated action between the promoters of the Club, that it was divulged that the Club had a total of close to 19,000 members, making it the largest social or recreational club in Singapore by a wide margin. Besides, this number of 19,000 excluded family members. Accordingly, in terms of membership size, RTC has no peer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the first appeal we recognised that assessment of damages in the present case \u201ccould pose some difficulties, though not insurmountable\u201d. We also noted that the depreciation in the price of membership due to the general weakened market condition for club memberships should be distinguished from that due to the breach.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before the assessment judge, the position ultimately adopted by the plaintiffs was that they claimed for losses on the following two distinct bases:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diminution in value of the RTC membership due to the breach;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Damages for loss of amenities, accessibility and enjoyment due to the large number of members.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In relation to the question of diminution in value, the plaintiffs assessed that to be in the sum of about $15,925, after disregarding the depreciation due to the general weakened market condition. For this purpose, the plaintiffs submitted that the proper date on which the diminution should be computed should be March 2001, as that was the date on which the plaintiffs, and in turn the public, came to know that the Club had such a large number of members. That should be taken to be the date of the breach; any other date would not be appropriate. We agree.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the assessment, the defendant argued that under the first head of claim, the plaintiffs were not entitled to any substantial damages but only nominal damages. As for the second head, the defendant submitted that damages should only be assessed in the light of individual circumstances; damages should not and could not be awarded on the basis of a single uniform sum for all the plaintiffs as the condition of each individual member would be different. For example, how often each plaintiff would use the facilities of the Club would obviously not be the same. Based on subsequent usage figures, particularly the recent ones, the defendant contended that the facilities of the Club were, in fact, under-utilised and thus there could not have been any loss of enjoyment by the plaintiffs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge refused the claim based on the first head on the ground that the plaintiffs had not satisfactorily proved the alleged diminution. However, she awarded each plaintiff damages of $1,000 for loss of amenities, accessibility and enjoyment of a premier club. She granted the plaintiffs the full costs of the assessment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both the plaintiffs and the defendant were dissatisfied with different aspects of the decision. The defendant filed its notice of appeal first, Civil Appeal No\u00a023 of 2005 (\u201cCA\u00a023/2005\u201d), challenging that part of the judgment granting to each plaintiff a sum of $1,000 for loss of amenities, <i>etc</i> as well as giving to the plaintiffs the full costs of the assessment. It contended that the award of $1,000 to each plaintiff was wrong in principle, and even if it were not wrong, the quantum given was excessive. The plaintiffs filed an appeal, Civil Appeal No\u00a028 of 2005 (\u201cCA\u00a028/2005\u201d), against that part of the judgment which refused to grant them damages based on the first head of claim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Diminution in value</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the defendant filed its notice of appeal before the plaintiffs, we think it is more logical to deal first with the question of the diminution in value of the RTC membership.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The gist of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that as the defendant has failed to deliver a premier club to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs should be entitled to be compensated in respect of the difference in value between a premier club and a non-premier club. The approach advanced by the plaintiffs was first to determine the market value of the RTC membership as at March 2001. Here, the plaintiffs relied upon the evidence of a club broker of 14 years\u2019 standing, Ms\u00a0Phua Geng Hoon (\u201cMs\u00a0Phua\u201d), whom they called as their witness. She gave evidence as to the market prices of 18 club memberships from 1996 to 2004, including that of RTC. According to the data, as of March 2001, the market price of an RTC membership was $10,800.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next, the plaintiffs relied on their expert witness, an economics analyst and a professor in both the Schools of Computing and Business at the National University of Singapore, Dr\u00a0Ivan Png Paak-Liang (\u201cDr\u00a0Png\u201d). Based on the sales data provided by Ms\u00a0Phua, Dr\u00a0Png made a study of eight comparable social clubs, namely, the American Club, the British Club, Europa Country Club, Fairway Club, Hollandse Club, Singapore Polo Club, Singapore Recreational Club and Superbowl Golf and Country Club (\u201cSuperbowl\u201d). Dr\u00a0Png found that the average decline in the price of the eight clubs over the period March 2000 to March 2001 was about 16.5% whilst RTC\u2019s decline was about 66.3%. However, we ought to explain that in making that calculation, Dr\u00a0Png took $32,000 as the price of RTC as at March 2000 because there was a transaction at that price at the time. Accordingly, he said that the RTC membership value suffered a larger decline than was generally the case and the excess decline of 49.8% must be due to the breach; a club with so many members, no matter how attractive its physical facilities, would have its value undermined as a result. In dollar terms, this 49.8% decline would work out to be a sum of about $15,925 (approximately 49.8% of $32,000), a loss which could not be attributable to the general weakened market.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs also called a club expert, Mr\u00a0Robert Sexton, who, having compared the fall in price of the RTC membership with the position prevailing in international clubs outside Singapore, came to the conclusion that the RTC membership price suffered the dramatic decline because of the perception that it was not a club of excellence or premier standing. We would like to state here that we do not think this part of Mr\u00a0Sexton\u2019s evidence is really helpful to determine the values of clubs in Singapore. A question as to the price or value of membership of a club must depend on local conditions. You may have two clubs of equal excellence (even here there may be controversy as to what \u201cexcellence\u201d means or entails) in two different countries, but it does not follow that their price movements must necessarily be in tandem. It is difficult enough to evaluate the worth of memberships of two clubs of similar standing in the same country, as so many factors would come into play. One would only compound the difficulties if one has to take into account the different economic conditions of two countries. The fact that a club of international standing in one country depreciated over a specified period by a low percentage has no relevance as far as a similar club in another country is concerned. No helpful conclusion can be drawn from their different rates of decline as to value.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant called two expert witnesses, both basically accountants but specialising in corporate financing and restructuring and business valuation. They testified that based on their studies, the RTC membership did not suffer any diminution in value on account of the breach. The first expert was Mr\u00a0Nicky Tan (\u201cMr\u00a0Tan\u201d). He used Pinetree Country Club (\u201cPinetree\u201d) and Fort Canning Country Club (\u201cFCC\u201d) as index clubs and said that the RTC membership price fell less than those two clubs over the same period of March 2000 to March 2001. In his view, the price movements of the memberships of these two clubs offered the best comparables. The second expert was Mr\u00a0Ong Yew Huat (\u201cMr\u00a0Ong\u201d), who used the Pinetree, FCC and another club, the Singapore Recreation Club (\u201cSRC\u201d), as comparables and he came to very much the same conclusion as Mr\u00a0Tan.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The law</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The principle governing damages for breach of contract is that they are to compensate the claimant for the loss or damage suffered by him on account of the breach. One of the earliest cases which enunciated this rule is <i>Robinson v Harman</i> (1848) 1\u00a0Exch 850; 154 ER 363 where Parke\u00a0B said at 855:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In cases such as this, involving a breach relating to intangible benefits, it is understandably difficult to determine the precise damages suffered by the promisee. In <i>Biggin &amp; Co Ltd v Permanite Ltd</i> <nobr>[1951] 1 KB 422</nobr>, which involved the delivery of defective goods, Devlin\u00a0J (as he then was) postulated that the court must do it even though clear proof was not possible and he said (at 438):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If the actual damaged goods are sold with all faults, good evidence can be obtained of the difference in value, but such a sale is not always possible, and a claim for substantial damages cannot be limited to goods which have been sold. Moreover, damage may arise from two sources. Suppose that goods are delivered which are inherently defective in breach of the contract of sale and that they are further damaged by negligent handling in breach of the contract of carriage, and that in their damaged condition they fetch 70 per cent. of their sound value. Is the plaintiff to recover nominal damages only because he cannot prove against either defendant what part of the depreciation in value was due to his acts? It is one thing to say, as I have said, that this is the sort of situation which parties in contemplating the measure of damage would be glad to avoid, and it is another thing to say that it is one which must necessarily result in an injured plaintiff obtaining no satisfaction. I think that in such a situation the court is bound to do the best that it can. It is no more difficult to estimate a plaintiff\u2019s loss in such circumstances than it is to estimate the loss of earning power caused by physical disablement. The third parties submit that the latter case is entirely different. I do not think the fundamental principle on which damages are awarded for breach of warranty of quality, namely, that it \u201cis the estimated loss\u201d directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events \u201cfrom the breach of warranty\u201d, is any different in principle. <i>It is only that where precise evidence is obtainable, the court naturally expects to have it. Where it is not, the court must do the best it can</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Devlin\u00a0J then quoted the following passage of Vaughan Williams\u00a0LJ in <i>Chaplin v Hicks</i> <nobr>[1911] 2 KB 786</nobr> at 792, which in our view is highly instructive:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the case of a breach of a contract for the delivery of goods the damages are usually supplied by the fact of there being a market in which similar goods can be immediately bought, and the difference between the contract price and the price given for the substituted goods in the open market is the measure of damages; that rule has been always recognised. Sometimes, however, there is no market for the particular class of goods; but no one has ever suggested that, because there is no market, there are no damages. In such a case the jury must do the best they can, and it may be that the amount of their verdict will really be a matter of guesswork. But the fact that damages cannot be assessed with certainty does not relieve the wrong-doer of the necessity of paying damages for his breach of contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Chaplin v Hicks</i></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">was a case where the defendant, in breach of contract, prevented the plaintiff, who belonged to a limited class of competitors, from winning a prize. Fletcher Moulton\u00a0LJ said (at 795):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">But it is said that the damages cannot be arrived at because it is impossible to estimate the quantum of the reasonable probability of the plaintiff\u2019s being a prize-winner. I think that, where it is clear that there has been actual loss resulting from the breach of contract, which it is difficult to estimate in money, it is for the jury to do their best to estimate; it is not necessary that there should be an absolute measure of damages in each case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Large membership benefits the plaintiffs</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, the defendant also made a strong submission which it made below, namely, that unless something like 19,000 persons were admitted into membership, the Club would not have been able to survive and if the Club could not continue, the plaintiffs would have lost everything. With 19,000 members, the Club could at least carry on and provide the facilities for the plaintiffs to enjoy. Thus, the plaintiffs suffered no loss and no damages should be awarded. Implicit in this argument is the suggestion that the plaintiffs should in fact appreciate that the defendant accepted so many members, as without a large member base, the Club would probably have ceased to exist.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, and like the judge below, we find this argument strange and, indeed, astonishing. That would be turning logic on its head. It was an implied term of the contract that the defendant would give to each of the plaintiffs a premier club. That was our determination in the first appeal. The defendant must fulfil that promise. What the defendant now seems to be saying is that if there were only a membership of 5,000 to 7,000, RTC would not be able to make ends meet and would have to close down. Thus, the present situation benefits the plaintiffs, who lost nothing from the breach as the Club is here and is still a viable concern. In our opinion, this argument completely ignores the defendant\u2019s contractual obligation of providing a premier club to the plaintiffs at $28,000 and to maintain it as such. What would be the cost of establishing and maintaining a premier club was a matter exclusively within the knowledge or control of the defendant. If the defendant had made a wrong bargain or calculation, it had only itself to blame. It should not be permitted to shift its responsibilities. It is pertinent to note that in its bi-monthly newsletter of March 1997, the defendant was aware that there was an optimal membership level that RTC had to observe to avoid overcrowding. It is important not to confuse the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to damages and the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the same. They are distinct matters. The fact that the defendant could well go under if the plaintiffs should execute their judgment is immaterial in law. Whether the plaintiffs would think that such an outcome would be in their interest is also a separate matter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Have the plaintiffs adduced evidence to show the diminution?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In her judgment, the assessment judge agreed with the submission of counsel for the plaintiffs that the applicable measure of damages was the difference in value between a premier club and a non-premier club as at the date of breach (<i>ie</i>, March 2001). However, she held that the plaintiffs had failed to prove this difference. She said at [25] to [27]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]n the context of the present case, as Ms\u00a0Lim [counsel for the plaintiffs] has argued that RTC with 19,000 members is worse than ordinary clubs, the plaintiffs have to, <i>inter alia</i>, identify those clubs they have in mind (and this was not done) as representing RTC\u2019s actual position because of the breach and to lead evidence on value. There is no material before the court from which an inference can be drawn as to the difference between the value of what was contracted for at a special price of $28,000 and which genre of clubs (and their value) that RTC with 19,000 members is said to have become on account of the defendant\u2019s breach. To this extent, the evidence is incomplete.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[W]ithout evidence of a differential in value, the court cannot assess in monetary terms (a) the position the plaintiffs would have been in if the breach of contract had not occurred and (b) their actual position as a result of the breach of contract, so that the difference is made up by an award of damages. The situation here is dissimilar to instances where precise or credible evidence is not available and the court must do the best it can with the evidence available.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I must stress that in no way does this judgment seek to impose any rigid \u201cformula\u201d or \u201cmethod\u201d to determine a just compensation. The simple fact of the matter is that I am not convinced that the plaintiffs\u2019 loss measured by the diminution in value of their club membership as presented is right on the facts of the present case. Such a measure is not, in my judgment, a proper assessment of what has been lost, and it should not be so used.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The point made by the defendant, which was accepted by the judge, was that if, as the plaintiffs contended, RTC should have taken in only 5,000 to 7,000 members to remain a premier club, their experts ought to have worked out the value of such a limited membership club and the value of an RTC membership with 19,000 members.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have earlier referred to the evidence of Ms\u00a0Phua. Based on her records, she gave evidence on the transactions relating to 18 social clubs memberships in Singapore, including RTC. As mentioned before, she set out, in a table, the price movements of the sales of memberships of those clubs over the period from 1996 to 2004. She also set out, in a schedule, the transfer fees charged by each of those clubs, the membership size of each club, the nature of the club and the number of years remaining of the lease of the land on which the club was situated.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specifically, in relation to RTC, she said that in March 2000, at the time the Club first opened, there was a transaction for an RTC membership at $32,000. In May 2000, it dropped to $28,000. By June 2000 the drop was even more severe, down to $16,000. Thereafter, the decline in price was more gradual, falling to $13,000 in December 2000 and $10,800 in March 2001 which was about the time the size of the Club\u2019s membership was disclosed to the public in the unrelated action among its promoters. Still later, in October 2003, its membership price went down to $7,300. It was increased to $7,400 in 2004, which increase, in Ms\u00a0Phua\u2019s opinion, was due to the goods and service tax being raised from 4% to 5%.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ms\u00a0Phua also told the court that the number of persons who wished to get rid of their RTC memberships greatly overwhelmed the trickling number of people who wished to acquire that membership.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, we will return to the evidence of Dr\u00a0Png. As mentioned before, relying on the data provided by Ms\u00a0Phua, he advanced a proposition based on an eight-club index. He explained that, unlike Mr\u00a0Tan and Mr\u00a0Ong, he excluded FCC from the eight-club index because it was severely affected by the financial difficulties of its proprietor, which was on the verge of going under. Next, Dr\u00a0Png adopted $32,000 as the market value of RTC as at March 2000, the date on which RTC officially opened. That was also the date on which the Club\u2019s members could resell their memberships if they had wanted to because the sale moratorium imposed by the defendant had expired. On the date of the breach, March 2001, an RTC membership was transacted at $10,800, a drop of $21,200 (from $32,000), or a 66.3% decline, approximately 49.8% more decline than the average decline of the eight-club index.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge explained the unsatisfactory aspect of the study as follows (at [45]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As it happened, the deterioration of the general market conditions straddled the period from December 1996 to March 2000. By using the March 2000 base period, the effects of the deterioration of the general market conditions in the earlier years on those clubs comprised in the index were not reflected whereas in the case of RTC, the moratorium caused a delayed effect on the fall of RTC prices due to the deteriorated general market condition in previous years. In the result, after the moratorium when transfers were eventually allowed for RTC memberships, the fall in price subsequently was significantly greater than those of the index. The situation lends itself to a distorted picture and any conclusions as to the effects of general market conditions on RTC relative to the index clubs need to be viewed with caution in the light of this anomaly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We understand why Dr\u00a0Png adopted $32,000 as the market value of the RTC membership as at March 2000. After all, there was a transaction at that price at the time. <i>Prima facie</i>, it would not be wrong to use that as an indication of market value. However, while there was no evidence to indicate that that transaction was not genuine, in view of the very sharp decline in the price of the RTC membership in the next few months, we have some hesitation in holding that all that depreciation was due to the breach and not to a delayed response to the decline in the general market. There was, after all, a moratorium on sale between December 1996 and March 2000. The sale at $32,000 in March 2000 could well be an aberration. Thus, we agree with the judge\u2019s view that adopting $32,000 as the market value as at March 2000 could create a distortion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ideally, if it is possible to have direct evidence of what a run-of-the-mill social club was worth as at March 2001 and what a premier social club would then be worth, that would probably be the best estimate of the loss suffered by each of the plaintiffs. From the data provided by Ms\u00a0Phua covering the 18 clubs, their transaction prices in March 2001 ranged from $1,200 for Superbowl to $43,000 for the American Club. Clearly, there are many factors which affect the price of membership of a club <i>eg</i>, the location of the club, whether it is a members\u2019 club or proprietary club, the administration and other charges which the club imposes to effect a transfer, its total memberships, the monthly subscription which a member has to bear, and the number of remaining years of the lease of the land on which the club stood. Taking Superbowl as an illustration, its transaction price has been at $1,200 from January 2001 to the present. Two factors should be noted. First the club imposed a transfer fee of $1,050. Second, the lease of the land on which the club stands has only five years left. Thus, when a member disposes of his membership in Superbowl, he will only get a net sum of $150.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, Pinetree, on which the experts of the defendant as well as Mr\u00a0Sexton for the plaintiffs placed importance, was transacted at $33,000 in December 1996 and $18,200 in March 2001, a decline of about 44.8%. It is true that Dr\u00a0Png did not venture to give figures as to what a premier social club and a run-of-the-mill club would be worth as at March 2001. We seriously doubt that he, or for that matter anyone else, could ever give a definite figure. There are plainly too many factors which could affect the value of a club. Whatever figure any expert gives would naturally have to rely upon the actual sale transactions relating to other similar social clubs here. All the experts were in agreement that Pinetree was an appropriate comparable. Mr\u00a0Sexton also thought that the American Club is also a premier club although it is a members\u2019 club. The difficulty here (of advancing a definite figure) is even greater than if the court were to be asked to determine how much a luxury car would cost or be worth. The first issue to be decided is what makes of cars fall within the category of \u201cluxury cars\u201d. The second issue is whether you are referring to a brand new car or a used car, and if the latter, the age of the car. An expert would probably not be able to give a single price unless those two points are clarified. In the case of a club, or a premier club, the imponderables are even greater.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The indisputable fact is that each of the plaintiffs paid $28,000 for a premier club as at December 1996. It is true that the defendant in its promotional materials had claimed that its membership was worth $40,000. We think one ought to differentiate between fact and sales pitch or puff. Thus, it is probably correct to say that $28,000 represented the likely market value of the RTC membership as at end 1996. At the date of the breach, March 2001, the RTC membership was transacted at $10,800. So between December 1996 and March 2001, the depreciation amounted to $17,200. Next, one must determine how much of that decline was due to the general weakened market condition or demand for club memberships over the same period. Once that is established, it would be fair to assume that the difference represented the decline due to the breach.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned before, the experts called by the defendant, Mr\u00a0Tan and Mr\u00a0Ong, had also given evidence on this. Mr\u00a0Tan opined that the RTC membership price fell less than Pinetree and FCC over the same period. Mr\u00a0Ong\u2019s computation was that during the period of March 2000 to October 2001 the decline of the RTC membership price was 33% whereas it was 50% for FCC, and 24% each for Pinetree and SRC, giving a similar average decline. It seems to us that the problem with Mr\u00a0Tan\u2019s and Mr\u00a0Ong\u2019s conclusions is that they both used FCC as an index club. For the reasons which we have alluded to earlier, to use FCC as an index club would be wrong. FCC was then in crisis and its members faced a real prospect of losing everything. Thus, to use the FCC as an index club (out of two or three) to determine the normal rate of decline of a social club would clearly cause a distortion. Moreover, the study done by Mr\u00a0Ong has one other difficulty. It relates to his selection of October 2001 as the cut-off date. He attempted to explain the choice of this date on the ground that October 2001 was one month before the present action was instituted by the plaintiffs and that that date would more accurately reflect the market price of the RTC membership before the bad publicity brought about by the present action could have had any impact on the price. But this explanation, in our view, is hardly convincing. October 2001 is of no relevance whatsoever. The choice of October 2001 seems like an <i>ex post facto</i> rationalisation of a pre-determined result.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We recognise that, <i>prima facie</i>, it is attractive to determine the loss due to the breach by merely looking at the position at Pinetree. The two experts of the defendant regarded Pinetree as an appropriate comparable. Dr\u00a0Png did not use Pinetree in his eight-club index not because Pinetree was not a premier club but because at the time the proprietor of Pinetree was also facing some financial problems. The plaintiffs\u2019 other expert, Mr\u00a0Sexton considered Pinetree a premier club. In December 1996, Pinetree was traded at $33,000. In March 2001 it was at $18,200, a decline of approximately 44.8%. For the corresponding period and on the basis earlier described (see [32]), the decline for the RTC membership price was about 61.4%. Thus one could reasonably attribute the excess decline of 16.6% to the breach. While admittedly such an approach could be criticised as being too narrow and not representative of the general decline due to the general state of the market condition, there are indeed considerable similarities between RTC and Pinetree. They are both proprietory clubs and are located in the same vicinity. They have broadly the same facilities and their target members were professionals and those from the business community. The only significant difference between the two is that, at the relevant time, Pinetree had only a membership of 4,800, whereas RTC had 19,000.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An even more direct way to determine the diminution in value of RTC due to the breach would be to compare the sale prices of the memberships of RTC and Pinetree as at March 2001. The parties were in agreement that Pinetree was a premier club of comparable standing to what RTC would have been if it had not accepted so many members. RTC was transacted at $10,800 and Pinetree at $18,200. These data were all brought into evidence by Ms\u00a0Phua. The difference is $7,400. This could be another method of determining the diminution in value of the RTC membership due to the breach. Thus we could not quite agree with the judge when she said at [25]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There is no material before the court from which an inference can be drawn as to the difference between the value of what was contracted for at a special price of $28,000 and which genre of clubs (and their value) that RTC with 19,000 members is said to have become on account of the defendant\u2019s breach. To this extent, the evidence is incomplete.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The eight-club index adopted by Dr\u00a0Png has the advantage of being more representative and thus it seems to us that the calculations obtained therefrom are more likely to be accurate. But, as we have indicated before, it would probably not be right to take the $32,000 transaction effected in March 2000 to be the starting point to make the comparison. The starting point ought to be December 1996, and it would be reasonable to assume that at that point what each of the plaintiffs paid for his or her RTC membership represented the fair value for that membership. Taking $28,000 at December 1996 and $10,800 at March 2001, the date of the breach, the decline in price is $17,200; in percentage terms this would be about 61.4%. On the eight-club index worked out by Dr\u00a0Png, the average decline over the corresponding period was approximately 50%. Thus, for RTC there was an enhanced decline of 11.4% which one could reasonably assume to be attributable to the breach, namely, that there were just too many members in RTC. This would work out to be the sum of $3,192. We should add that this is one alternative method which the plaintiffs have submitted in their Case before us. We think this is as fair and rational a method to work out the probable loss due to the defendant\u2019s breach as any. In a clearly inexact issue such as this, there is simply no one indisputable formula to work out the loss. There are flaws in every method which could be used for this purpose. Common sense tells us that a club with 5,000 to 7,000 members would be more valuable or sought after than the same club with some 19,000 members. The court has to work out the plaintiffs\u2019 loss as best as it can based on the data placed before it. If there had been no moratorium on the sale of RTC memberships during the period between December 1996 and March 2001, it would probably have been easier to determine the loss due to the breach.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge seemed to think that the way the plaintiffs formulated their claim, on the basis of depreciation in the value of the membership, was as though the defendant had given a warranty to each of the plaintiffs that the value of his or her membership would not decline. She also thought that what the plaintiffs were seeking was a refund under the guise of damages. However, she accepted that diminution in value was an appropriate method of assessing compensation on the facts of this case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we see it, we do not think the claim of the plaintiffs under the first head is based on any warranty given by the defendant against a decline in value of its membership. Of course, there was never any warranty of any kind. The plaintiffs were only trying to determine the loss due to the breach. They bought the membership at $28,000 in December 1996, and at March 2001, the membership was transacted at $10,800. While it is true that the contract price of $28,000 need not necessarily represent the true value of the membership, it is nevertheless the best evidence of its value. It is true that at the time when the plaintiffs were invited to subscribe for membership, they were told by the defendant that the membership was, in fact, worth $40,000. If one were to take $40,000 as the base figure, then the decline in the value of the RTC membership would be even sharper. The plaintiffs were not taking that line; neither are we.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If contract or transacted prices cannot be taken on the face of it to represent the fair value of memberships of clubs, we wonder what other bases there can be. Common sense tells us that value must obviously, among other things, depend on demand. There is no immutable value as to any thing, whether tangible or intangible. That is so even for precious things like gold or diamond. The same must be said for club memberships. An expert must give his opinion based, as far as possible, on objective facts or indicators. We would have thought that actual transactions are probably the best such indicators.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note that the judge was concerned about the reliability of the sales statistics. She remarked at [44]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Dr\u00a0Png agreed that unlike the stock market where shares are transacted actively on a daily basis, memberships in the club market are bought and sold infrequently. Another feature of the club market is that there is less transparency in the timing and disclosure of the transacted prices unlike in the stock market where transacted prices are recorded immediately for all to see. Dr\u00a0Png has admitted in his supplementary affidavit that he has had to accommodate for the delay in disclosure of transacted club prices by considering changes in prices for one, two, three and four months after the relevant dates.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While we agree with her comments, the fact is that the sales data are nevertheless the best thing we have got, in the absence of a more transparent market, like the Singapore Exchange for stocks and shares, which would record instantaneously all transactions in club memberships. The volume in club transactions is low. There could also be mistakes in reporting or recording, but we are unable to see any reason why anyone would deliberately want to falsify a transaction, either as to price or date. After all, the transfer fee levied by a club is fixed and not based upon a percentage of the transacted price. If the court were to take the view that all the sales data on the 18 clubs were suspect, the court must still do its best to assess the loss, an exercise no more difficult, and perhaps easier, than that in <i>Chaplin v Hicks</i> which related to the plaintiff\u2019s chance of being picked as a prize winner in a beauty contest. Even the judge acknowledged that the present case is not one where nominal damages would suffice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What we are trying to determine is the value of an RTC membership as at March 2001 if the Club had a membership of between 5,000 and 7,000. We know that an RTC membership with 19,000 members was traded at $10,800. There is no one correct way to work that out. The method of using Pinetree and doing a direct calculation referred to in [35] above is one method. Another method is to use the rate of decline in Pinetree to ascertain the loss (see [34] above). The third method would be the use of the decline in price of RTC from December 1996 to March 2001 and applying the eight-club index (see [36] above). The latter does provide a practical and fairer mechanism to determine the diminution in value due to the breach.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge said at [26] that the situation here \u201cis dissimilar to instances where precise or credible evidence is not available\u201d. She further commented at [28] that the plaintiffs\u2019 experts \u201chave not in the assessment calculated the value of RTC membership based on 5,000 members and how much the RTC membership would have been worth if the Club had 14,000 more members\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But should the fact that Dr\u00a0Png did not offer a figure as to the value of an RTC membership (with only 5,000 members) as at March 2001 prove fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the first head? The data on the transactions relating to the 18 clubs were before the court. We do not think it is that essential that Dr\u00a0Png should say more. In any event, in our judgment, the third method contended by the plaintiffs, referred to in [42] above and elaborated on at [36] above, does provide a reasonable and fair way to determine the loss due to the breach and we think it should therefore be adopted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of the above, each plaintiff should be entitled to $3,192 in damages under the first head. However, this being only an estimate, we would round it down to $3,000 for each plaintiff. In the light of this holding, there will be no further order for damages under the second head, as there is much overlap in the two heads of claim.

lang=\"EN-GB\">Belinda Ang Saw Ean\u00a0J (delivering the judgment of the court):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is an appeal against the decision of the trial judge (\u201cthe judge\u201d) dismissing the appellant\u2019s claim for damages for personal injuries suffered in an accident at his workplace on 22\u00a0June 2002 (see <nobr>[2006] 1 SLR 697</nobr>). The respondents are BT\u00a0Engineering Pte Ltd (\u201cBT\u00a0Engineering\u201d) and Keppel Shipyard Limited (\u201cKeppel\u201d). It was agreed between the parties that only the question of liability would be determined at the trial, with damages to be assessed separately.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appellant\u2019s case in the court below</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some two months before the accident, the appellant, Sim Cheng Soon (\u201cSCS\u201d), who was a welder by trade, and other workers from BT\u00a0Engineering were deployed to carry out welding work on board the <i>Falcon</i> (\u201cthe vessel\u201d), a tanker which was being converted to a floating production storage and offloading vessel at Keppel\u2019s shipyard. Multiheight Scaffolding Pte Ltd (\u201cMultiheight\u201d) was engaged by BT\u00a0Engineering to erect the scaffolding and the working platform required for the conversion works.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 22\u00a0June 2002 at about 8.00am, the appellant started work in an area of the vessel known as Module\u00a010. On the day of the accident, he was working at level\u00a03 of the module. At about 11.30am, just before his lunch break, the appellant went about detaching his welding torch and putting away his equipment pail in a temporary storage area located at level\u00a02. Thereafter, he walked along the working platform at level\u00a02 towards the access ladder (identified by the judge as \u201cladder\u00a03\u201d) to descend to the vessel\u2019s deck. The appellant\u2019s account of the accident was, in effect, this: He said that before he could reach ladder\u00a03, he fell through an uncovered and unfenced opening at the level\u00a02 working platform where there should have been a platform of planks. At this point, instead of stepping onto a platform, the appellant, as the judge put it, \u201cstepped into empty space\u201d and fell through the opening to the deck below, thereby sustaining serious personal injuries. According to the appellant, he fell from a height of more than 3m. The respondents, however, maintained that the fall was from a height of not more than 3m. The appellant was alone when the accident happened.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant challenged the admissibility of the photographs which the respondents adduced in evidence. According to the respondents, the photographs were taken by one of Keppel\u2019s safety officers, Ng Sze Kiat (\u201cNg\u201d), shortly after the accident on the same day. The appellant argued that the photographs could not have been taken on the day of the accident itself because they depicted barricades at the place where he had fallen when there were in fact no such barricades present at the time of the accident. The appellant also claimed that there had originally been planks covering the opening through which he fell, but that the planks must, unknown to him at the material time, have been removed one day before the accident. He complained that there were no signs or notices put up to warn him of the resultant opening in the working platform.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the trial, the appellant claimed that BT\u00a0Engineering owed him a duty of care as an employer, and also statutory duties under the Factories Act (Cap\u00a0104, 1998\u00a0Rev Ed) and the Factories (Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing) Regulations (Cap\u00a0104, Rg\u00a011, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Factories Regulations\u201d) made pursuant to ss\u00a068 and 102 of the Factories Act. As against Keppel, the appellant claimed that it was in breach of its statutory duties under the Factories Act and the Factories Regulations as the occupier of the work site in question. The earlier claim against Keppel based on its common law duty as occupier was abandoned on appeal and as such, we need not go into that.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The defence</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondents served a joint defence which not only questioned the appellant\u2019s account of how the accident happened, but also went on to explain how the accident probably happened and why the appellant\u2019s injuries were so serious. In the court below, the respondents set out to prove that the appellant lost his grip while he was descending ladder\u00a03 and thus fell from the ladder, and not from the working platform at level\u00a02 as the appellant claimed. The respondents called two witnesses to establish that it was not possible for the appellant to have fallen from either the working platform at level\u00a02 or the top of the generator to the right of ladder\u00a03. They were Mohamed Aliffi bin Ismail (\u201cIsmail\u201d), the safety manager of Keppel, and Lim Nyuk Kok (\u201cLim\u201d), a site manager of Multiheight. Accompanied by Ng, who took the photographs at the scene of the accident and who subsequently prepared the investigation report, Ismail was at the scene of the accident within an hour of the accident. Ismail confirmed that the photographs were of the place of the accident and its surroundings. He testified that the open sides of the working platform at level\u00a02 were barricaded with railings. He also saw the edges of the top of the generator \u201call ... railed up\u201d. The judge admitted the photographs as evidence. Lim was called to interpret the photographs and explain the structures depicted therein. He confirmed that the scaffolding poles shown in photograph\u00a02 and marked \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d were barricades put up to prevent any worker from falling from the open sides of the working platform. As such, and contrary to the appellant\u2019s assertions, there could not have been planks placed outside the area barricaded by the scaffolding poles because no worker was meant to have access to the area to begin with.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Keppel\u2019s investigations (which, incidentally, did not include interviewing the appellant), the appellant was not, at the material time, wearing his safety helmet. The respondents submitted that if the appellant had worn a safety helmet, the extent of the injuries which he sustained would not have been so serious.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The decision below</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge rejected the appellant\u2019s version of how the accident happened and concluded that on the balance of probabilities, the effective cause of the accident was the appellant\u2019s fall from ladder\u00a03 during descent, which was entirely due to his negligence. Accordingly, the judge dismissed the action against the respondents.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge\u2019s findings were, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The photographs adduced in evidence were taken on the day of and after the accident. Ismail was present when all the photographs were taken except in respect of photographs\u00a09 and 10.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The photographs showed barriers surrounding the opening through which the appellant purportedly fell. On one side of photograph\u00a02 were three barriers marked \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d and on the opposite side were three barriers marked \u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d. All the barriers met and were connected by a vertical pole at three places marked as \u201cG\u201d, \u201cH\u201d and \u201cI\u201d on photograph\u00a02. The judge said that the photographs also showed railings surrounding the edges of the top of the generator next to ladder\u00a03. The judge then concluded that the photographs showed the appellant\u2019s version of the accident to be \u201cinherently improbable\u201d. She further found that there could not have been planks (parallel with the I-beam which was directly opposite the generator and to the left of ladder\u00a03) at the opening which had been removed a day before the accident.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant had not discharged the burden of proof, which was upon him, to explain how he fell or how the accident happened. He said he had stepped into \u201cempty space\u201d instead of onto a platform of planks and had fallen. The judge found the appellant\u2019s testimony to be vague and evasive. She was also not satisfied with the appellant\u2019s explanation of the discrepancy between his version of the accident as set out in his lawyer\u2019s letter to the respondents dated 13\u00a0November 2002 and the version which he gave in court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant was found lying on his back on the deck. That position was consistent with the appellant falling off ladder\u00a03 during descent. A person using a ladder would fall backwards and land on his back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant was not wearing a safety helmet at the time of the accident. If he had worn a safety helmet, he would not have sustained the serious head injuries that rendered him a quadriplegic.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In coming to the above findings of fact and conclusions, the judge would have been persuaded by the overall impressions and considerations of the respondents\u2019 evidence. Some of these may not have been expressly specified by the judge in coming to her decision, but they were nonetheless implicit from her narration of the evidence and her reasoning. In rejecting the appellant\u2019s version of the accident as \u201cinherently improbable\u201d, the judge would have to first accept, which she did, that the open sides of the working platform at level\u00a02 were fenced or barricaded by the scaffolding poles marked \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d in photograph\u00a02, and that these poles could adequately function as guard rails. Having found that the scaffolding poles marked \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d acted as guard rails, the judge accepted Lim\u2019s evidence that, contrary to the appellant\u2019s testimony, there could not have been any planks placed parallel to the I-beam on the opposite side of the generator and then removed just a day before the accident. Lim\u2019s reasoning was that a scaffolding contractor would not ordinarily erect a working platform or place any planks outside a fenced or barricaded opening. By ruling in the respondents\u2019 favour, the judge accepted the respondents\u2019 case that (a)\u00a0access to ladder\u00a03 was from the working platform behind ladder\u00a03 at the area near the scaffolding poles marked as \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in photograph\u00a02, and (b) the appellant was already on ladder\u00a03 when he fell. In contrast, the appellant\u2019s testimony was that he fell from the level\u00a02 working platform even before he reached ladder\u00a03. At the material time, he was approaching ladder\u00a03 from the front rather than from the working platform behind ladder\u00a03. According to the appellant, the scaffolding poles \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d impeded safe access to ladder\u00a03 from the working platform behind ladder\u00a03.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge held, <i>obiter</i>, that even if she was wrong in her finding that the appellant fell off ladder\u00a03 instead of in the manner which he had described, the respondents were still not liable to the appellant as there was no breach of ss\u00a033(2) and 33(3) of the Factories Act. The respondents had provided the appellant with a safe means of access to the work site (<i>ie</i>, the vessel) and a safe place of work there. There was a safe system of work due to the stringent safety checks that were put in place by Keppel. In any case, the opening in question was visible and large. The judge was of the view that had the appellant kept a proper lookout, he would have seen the opening. Finally, the judge had no doubt that there was no breach of duty by Keppel as the occupier of the work site as there was no concealed or unusual danger on the vessel that Keppel was aware of.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant\u2019s main grounds of appeal were as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge erred in admitting the photographs.

The question here is the admissibility of the photographic evidence and whether such evidence, if received, supported the view that scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d functioned as guard rails fencing the open side of the level\u00a02 working platform from where the appellant purportedly fell.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should point out that central to the circumstances of the accident, and hence to this appeal, was the finding that the open sides of the level\u00a02 working platform were barricaded with scaffolding poles \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d which functioned as guard rails. It was not necessary in this appeal for this court to make a specific finding as to whether there had originally been planks covering the spot from which the appellant fell (see [4] above). In the court below, the appellant did not call any witness to corroborate his claim that the missing plank(s) (or \u201cplatform\u201d as the judge called it) was on the level\u00a02 working platform the day before the accident. This was surprising, as other workers working on Module\u00a010 would also have made use of ladder\u00a03. However, fortunately for the appellant, he needed only to prove that he fell from an unfenced or insufficiently fenced opening at the edge of the working platform at level\u00a02. Furthermore, even though the judge found the appellant evasive in his evidence, this would have no bearing on whether there was in fact an unfenced or an insufficiently fenced opening at the edge of the working platform at level\u00a02.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the appellant, Mr\u00a0N\u00a0Sreenivasan, argued that the appellant\u2019s account of the accident should have prevailed before the judge. It was submitted that the photographs were wrongly admitted as the photographer, Ng, was not called to prove that they were taken by him on the day of the accident. Effectively, the only evidence available before the court as to the cause of the accident was the appellant\u2019s testimony. The accident, it was argued, was due to the respondents\u2019 breaches of duty: the appellant fell from the level\u00a02 working platform as there was no or inadequate fencing along the open side of the working platform.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the respondents, Ms\u00a0Edwina Fan, accepted that the photographs were critical as they showed barriers surrounding the alleged open side of the working platform from which the appellant had purportedly fallen. She contended that the photographs were properly admitted in evidence. The judge was right to have accepted Ismail\u2019s evidence that he was present and saw Ng take the photographs. Lim\u2019s interpretation of the photographs was crucial in explaining why the appellant\u2019s version of how the accident happened was improbable. Ms\u00a0Fan argued that the judge was right to have accepted Lim\u2019s testimony that the photographs showed that there were barriers erected at the side of the working platform from which the appellant allegedly fell, such that it was \u201cinherently improbable\u201d for the appellant to have fallen from the working platform in the way which he claimed. If anything, the accident was due to the appellant\u2019s fault. He was careless and did not keep a proper lookout for his own safety.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the question of the photographic evidence, we agree with the judge\u2019s ruling that the photographs were admissible in evidence through the testimony of Ismail, who was with Ng at the time the latter took the photographs. Ismail had testified that the photographs depicted what he saw at the site of the accident and the surrounding scaffolding. Ismail also saw the photographs after they were developed in the course of Ng\u2019s preparation of the investigation report and during his discussion with Ng. The investigation report was later approved and confirmed by Ismail. Since the photographs could be proved through Ismail, Ng\u2019s attendance in court was unnecessary. Therefore, contrary to the appellant\u2019s submissions, there was nothing adverse to infer from the respondents\u2019 failure to call Ng as a witness. The respondents had earlier explained that Ng had left Keppel\u2019s employment and was presently working in China.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The onus of proof was always on the appellant to explain how he fell from the working platform and also to explain why this fall was due to the negligence of the respondents or a breach of statutory duty on the part of Keppel. Contrary to the respondents\u2019 submissions, from the transcripts of the evidence, the appellant steadfastly maintained throughout that scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d were not guard rails as they were too low to prevent any person from falling from the working platform. From our analysis of the photographs, we agree. Notably, the focal point of the important photographs was ladder\u00a03. Photograph\u00a02 shows an I-beam to the left of the photograph. To its immediate right is ladder\u00a03, next to which is the generator at the other end of scaffolding poles \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d. Scaffolding poles \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d, which were erected horizontally, are parallel to each other at varying heights. Scaffolding pole \u201cD\u201d is attached perpendicular to \u201cB\u201d above the top of the generator at that end of \u201cB\u201d which is away from the I-beam. The spot from which the appellant allegedly fell is at the edge of the two wooden planks shown in the foreground of photograph\u00a02. Scaffolding pole \u201cF\u201d runs under one of the two wooden planks and also ends there. These two wooden planks are not in photograph\u00a03 as it was taken from a different angle. Photograph\u00a03 shows ladder\u00a03 and a small section of scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d. It is impossible to see from photographs\u00a02 and 3 whether scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d were of heights which correspond with scaffolding poles \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d or \u201cC\u201d. Significantly, there were no photographs showing the full length of poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d. There were also no photographs showing the railings surrounding the edges of the top of the generator. We found it surprising that Ismail did not ask that photographs be taken of the area immediately above the top of the generator as proof that the edges were, as he put it, \u201call ... railed up\u201d (see [6] above) since, if he was to be believed, the investigations which would typically be done in a case like this, where a workman had a bad fall, ought to identify or rule out any unsafe open sides. The judge did not draw the necessary inference from these matters when considering the photographic evidence. The judge did, however, observe that the railings which Ismail saw in relation to the small gap of about 180mm wide on the working platform at level\u00a02 immediately behind ladder\u00a03 were scaffolding poles \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in photograph\u00a02, and that they were not on the same side of the working platform as the side from which the appellant fell.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the photographic evidence and the appellant\u2019s account of how he fell into empty space, the absence of proper guard rails at the edge of the level\u00a02 working platform is, in our view, the only credible explanation as to how the appellant fell. It follows that the judge should not have accepted Lim\u2019s testimony that the edge of the working platform at level\u00a02 was barricaded.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, there were two important features of Lim\u2019s evidence in particular which rendered it inadmissible evidence. The first is that Lim was not a witness of fact or an expert witness. He was from the company engaged to erect the scaffolding on the vessel\u2019s decks (<i>ie</i>, Multiheight). However, he was not responsible for and did not supervise the construction of the scaffolding and working platform. Lim had no personal knowledge of what scaffolding had been erected at the material time since he had not visited the vessel on 22\u00a0June 2002 either before or after the accident. Lim also admitted under cross-examination that he was not in a position to know whether the scaffolding in Module\u00a010 of the vessel had been properly constructed or maintained as that was a temporary scaffolding. There were no written instructions or drawings as to where Multiheight was supposed to construct or dismantle the scaffolding and working platforms in Module\u00a010. Similarly, there were no construction drawings that could confirm that there were guard rails made up by scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d. Lim was, therefore, not competent to give evidence on matters he had not seen or otherwise had no personal knowledge about.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is an accepted principle that only expert witnesses may give opinion evidence. Notably, Lim was not called as an expert witness. Yet, he gave what was substantially opinion evidence under the guise of interpreting and explaining the layout and function of the scaffolding poles and the working platform in the photographs. This offends the general rule that inferences of fact must be made by the court and not the witness. The present situation is unlike those cases where a layman who has observed the primary facts is allowed to give inferential or opinion evidence on a state of affairs or a condition, for instance, that a person whom he had observed was drunk or ill or angry or looked old. Evidence of that nature can be received, but its weight and probative value are for the court to evaluate. In breach of the hearsay rule, Lim gave opinion evidence on what was in the photographs as though the contents of the photographs were proof of matters of fact.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second feature which follows from the hearsay point is that the judge should not have accepted Lim\u2019s views on the height of scaffolding poles \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d. As stated (see [19] above), scaffolding poles \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d were erected horizontally and parallel to each other at varying heights. Scaffolding pole \u201cD\u201d was attached perpendicular to \u201cB\u201d at that end of \u201cB\u201d which was away from the I-beam and above the top of the generator. Although no evidence in terms of actual measurements was given, Lim stated that scaffolding pole \u201cA\u201d functioned as the upper rail and was waist-high; \u201cB\u201d was the middle rail and was knee-high; and \u201cC\u201d was above the ankle. The height of scaffolding pole \u201cD\u201d was important to the respondents\u2019 case and no doubt, appreciating the limitations posed by the available photographic evidence which we have highlighted earlier at [19], Lim\u2019s opinion was material. Lim was asked \u201cto advise\u201d on the height of scaffolding pole \u201cD\u201d without the benefit of any photographs showing the full length and overall view of scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d. Lim opined that scaffolding pole \u201cD\u201d functioned as the upper rail. That was because the top of the generator was lower than the working platform by about \u201c2 to 3 feet\u201d. His opinion was not only based on his observations and the inferences which he drew from what he saw in photographs\u00a02 and 3; his testimony went beyond what was in the photographs. He was allowed to express his subjective opinion on what was essentially a disputed issue of fact. As we stated earlier at [20] above, the judge should have rejected Lim\u2019s testimony that the open side from which the appellant said he fell was \u201cfenced and barricaded\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A related and important consideration is whether there was sufficient objective evidence for the judge to make her own evaluation on the height of scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d. No one took measurements of the height of scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d, so there was no evidence that \u201cD\u201d was a safety rail 1.1m high as required by the Factories Regulations. The evidential deficiency or gap could not be made good by assessing the height of the poles from the photographs, as Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan sought to do when he submitted on the dimensions of the scaffolding based upon a visual assessment of the distance between each rung of ladder\u00a03. It must be remembered that a photograph is not proof of the dimensions of the objects depicted. It is not possible to work out distances and calculate measurements based on objects depicted in photographs under the guise of submissions. Instead, this is a matter for expert testimony, as can be seen from <i>United States Shipping Board v The Ship St Albans</i> <nobr>[1931] AC 632.</nobr> That case concerned a collision between two vessels. The point in the harbour at which the collision occurred was material. Photographs taken from a third moving ship showing the vessels just before and after the collision, with the frontage of the harbour in the background, were adduced in evidence. Based on the photographs, a surveyor fixed the focal point of the camera from which each photograph was taken, and then by reference to the background, attempted to geometrically determine and localise the collision. The surveyor\u2019s evidence was rejected by the House of Lords as the task mentioned required the science or skill of a qualified person and the surveyor was not such an expert witness. Lord\u00a0Merrivale said (at 642):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Clearly a photographic picture cannot be relied upon as proof in itself of the dimensions of the depicted object or objects, and cannot be made properly available to establish the relative proportions of such objects except by evidence of personal knowledge or scientific experience to demonstrate accurately the facts sought to be established.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Likewise, it was not permissible to gauge the height of poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d and the distance between the top of the generator and the working platform based upon a mere visual inspection of the photographs as Lim did. In the same way, it was not permissible to ascertain the height of the poles based on the distance between each rung of ladder\u00a03 from the photographs as Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan tried to do.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, for the reasons stated, there was no countervailing evidence to contradict the appellant\u2019s evidence that scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d were much too low to qualify as guard rails or operate as safety barriers. The appellant would not have seen pole \u201cF\u201d which was under the two wooden planks shown in the foreground of photograph\u00a02 (see [19] above). In these circumstances, it is open to this court to accept, which we do, that on a balance of probabilities, the appellant fell from the side of the insufficiently barricaded or guarded working platform at level\u00a02, and not from ladder\u00a03.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was foreseeable that a workman like the appellant would fall from the insufficiently fenced side of the working platform and sustain injuries. Keppel\u2019s health, safety and environmental manual (\u201cKeppel\u2019s safety manual\u201d) highlights in particular falls from a working platform or from the edge of a structure as one of the major types of accidents in the shipbuilding and ship repairing industry where the fallen persons either die or suffer serious multiple injuries. Common causes of falls from heights are likely to be an unguarded platform, an unfenced opening or an unfenced edge. Safety measures to prevent persons from falling from heights are, <i>inter alia,</i> the provision of guard rails at the open sides of scaffolding. Keppel\u2019s safety personnel were to ensure that BT\u00a0Engineering, its employees and subcontractors observed Keppel\u2019s safety manual.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We accept that it was probable that the appellant did not exercise sufficient care to keep a proper lookout as to where he was walking. Even then, his lack of care as he made his way towards ladder\u00a03 would not necessarily defeat the claim in its entirety. If BT\u00a0Engineering was in breach of its duty of care to the appellant as his employer or if Keppel had failed to provide the safety provisions required of it under the Factories Act as the occupier of the shipyard, and as a result a workman, such as the appellant, was injured in a way which could have resulted from the breach, the onus of proof would shift to the respondents to show that their breaches of their duties of care to the appellant were not the proximate cause of the appellant\u2019s fall. The question in this case is whether the appellant would have fallen but for the absence of proper guard rails that could function as a barrier. If either BT\u00a0Engineering or Keppel were in breach of their respective duties, then the appellant here would not in any sense be taking advantage of his own wrong if BT\u00a0Engineering\u2019s or Keppel\u2019s breaches of duties coincided with his own negligence and continued up to the very moment of the accident. If the court is satisfied that there was fault on the part of both the appellant and the respondents, the issue then is one of determining the extent to which it is just and equitable to reduce the damages which would otherwise be recoverable by the appellant. We will be considering these aspects of the case below.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Liability of the respondents</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">the present case, the non-delegable duty of care owed by BT\u00a0Engineering to the appellant to provide a safe place of work continued even though Multiheight was engaged as the scaffolding contractor and despite the fact that the appellant was working at Keppel\u2019s premises: see <i>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on Negligence</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th\u00a0Ed, 2001) at para\u00a010-31. The appellant had suffered injuries while he was on the working platform set up by and under the charge of Multiheight. BT\u00a0Engineering was required to erect scaffolding and working platforms for the conversion works. Multiheight had a scaffolding supervisor on site. This scaffolding supervisor from Multiheight was the person in charge of the erection and dismantling of the scaffolding, and it was he who had to observe, <i>inter alia</i>, Keppel\u2019s safety manual.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both Keppel as occupier and BT\u00a0Engineering as employer were obliged to comply with the Factories Regulations. Regulation\u00a04(1), which was in force at the time of the accident, imposes a duty on every occupier, contractor or employer to comply with the requirements of the Factories Regulations as they affect him or any other person employed by him, which in this case was the appellant. Regulation\u00a04(2) imposes a duty on every occupier, contractor or employer who, <i>inter alia</i>, erects any scaffolding to comply with that part of the Factories Regulations which relates to the erection of scaffolding having regard to the purpose or purposes for which the scaffolding is designed at the time of erection.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The burden of proof was on Keppel and BT\u00a0Engineering to prove that they had complied with the statutory obligations under the Factories Regulations. The respondents have failed to do so for the reasons set out below.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keppel was in charge of the overall safety of the site, which was a \u201cfactory\u201d within the meaning of the Factories Act. The insufficiently fenced or guarded working platform pointed <i>prima facie</i> to a definite breach of the safety provision imposed on the occupier of a \u201cfactory\u201d under reg\u00a085 which states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There shall be no opening in any working platform except to allow access to that working platform.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondents argued that reg\u00a085 was not applicable as the opening through which the appellant fell was found outside that part of the working platform which was barricaded by the scaffolding poles and that the same reasoning applied in the case of regs\u00a091(1) and 91(6). These arguments are no longer valid in the light of our finding that there were in fact no proper guard rails that could have served as a barrier against a careless worker falling off the edge of the working platform at level\u00a02.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondents also argued that there was no breach of reg\u00a09 read with reg\u00a093(1)(<i>a</i>) as the height of the working platform was not more than 3m in this case. There was therefore no obligation to provide guard rails of adequate strength to a height of at least 1.1m above the working platform. The relevant regulations read as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9.</span></b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Every open side or opening into or through which a person may fall more than 3 metres shall be covered or guarded by an effective barrier to prevent falls except where free access is required by persons or for the movement of materials.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">93.</span></b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2014(1)\u00a0Subject to paragraphs\u00a0(4),(5) and (6), every side of a working platform or working place, being a side from which a person is liable to fall a distance of more than 3 metres, shall be provided with \u2014</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>a</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a suitable guardrail or guardrails of adequate strength to a height of at least 1.1 metres above the platform or working place and above any raised standing place on the platform \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated, no measurement was taken of the height of the generator or the height of the working platform and scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d. Ismail\u2019s testimony was ambiguous. He said that ladder\u00a03 was 3m in height and that the top of the generator was \u201cslightly lower\u201d than ladder\u00a03. He did not testify as to the distance between the working platform and the top of the generator which was marked X on photograph\u00a03. In our view, the respondents had not discharged the burden of proof, which was on them, to establish that (a)\u00a0the height of the working platform from the deck up was not more than 3m, or that (b)\u00a0the height of scaffolding poles \u201cD\u201d and E\u201d was at least 1.1m. The appellant fell from the open side of the working platform and not from the top of the generator. It is more probable than not, and we so find, that the working platform at level\u00a02 was more than 3m from the deck. Before the judge, the respondents\u2019 position was that the open sides of the working platform were barricaded as required by law. By that, they accepted, albeit tacitly, that the height of the working platform from the deck was more than 3m and not lower as they claimed in this appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36<b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> Having reached the conclusions above, it is unnecessary to deal with the other statutory provisions under s\u00a033 of the Factories Act. However, we should briefly comment on ss\u00a033(2) and 33(3) of the Factories Act as the judge considered them and was of the view that the respondents were not in breach of the subsections. Besides, it was an issue raised in this appeal (see [12] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, the appellant fell from the edge of the working platform, which cannot be regarded as an opening in the floor within the meaning of s\u00a033(2) of the Factories Act. This court in <i>Bohman v Jurong Town Corp</i> <nobr>[1980-1981] SLR 167</nobr> held that unfenced edges of a platform were not \u201copenings in floors\u201d within the contemplation of the s\u00a033(2). Accordingly, s\u00a033(2) does not apply in this case. Second, s\u00a033(3) is concerned with a safe means of access to and a safe place of employment. Given our findings at [26] and [35] above, the respondents were in our view in breach of s\u00a033(3) of the Factories Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Contributory negligence</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to the question of contributory negligence. The respondents contended that the appellant was wholly to blame for the accident and should bear full responsibility for the accident. We have to again emphasise that this was not a case where the only breach on the part of BT\u00a0Engineering as the appellant\u2019s employer and Keppel as the occupier of the shipyard consisted of the sole act of the workman himself (for instance, where the workman fails to operate a machine in accordance with the safety features provided).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The accident took place in broad daylight and there was no challenge that there was enough natural lighting for the appellant to see where he was going. The appellant admitted that he had ample time to get to level\u00a01. He had worked at shipyards in the past and had undergone safety courses at Keppel\u2019s shipyard. He had also attended organised safety talks and meetings both generally and specifically for the conversion works to be done of the vessel. He was familiar with the layout of level\u00a02, having worked there for about a week before moving up to level\u00a03. He had also gone up and down ladder\u00a03 several times over a period of two to three weeks. The appellant\u2019s familiarity with the surrounding areas of level\u00a02 would be a factor to be taken into account when assessing his culpability.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span lang=\"EN-GB\">This accident could have happened if there was a degree of inattention or carelessness on the part of the appellant for his own safety: for instance, if he banged his shins on one of the scaffolding poles, walked into one of the poles and tripped over or fell from the insufficiently-fenced side of the working platform. It therefore behoved the appellant to keep a careful lookout. The fact of the matter was that the appellant had not looked at where he was going and this was the immediate cause of the accident. It was because of the appellant\u2019s neglect in this regard that he failed to notice the edge of the working platform and thus stepped off the edge of the platform. We find that the appellant was negligent in failing to observe the ordinary care which an ordinary prudent person would have taken for his own safety. Blameworthiness was there and to a higher degree than that of the respondents as employer and occupier of the site respectively. Accordingly, we apportion liability at 40% to the respondents and 60% to the appellant by way of contributory negligence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now come to the remaining issue in this appeal. The judge\u2019s finding, that (a)\u00a0the appellant was not wearing a safety helmet and (b)\u00a0the position in which he landed on the vessel\u2019s deck, was consistent with his having fallen off ladder\u00a03 is, with respect, neither here nor there. First, we cannot readily draw any conclusion from the fact that the appellant was not wearing a safety helmet when he fell, as the appellant\u2019s head injuries were minimal according to the medical reports. The head injuries did not render him a quadriplegic. Instead, he became a quadriplegic because he broke his spine as a result of the fall. Second, the judge regarded the undisputed evidence that the appellant was found lying on his back as a strong indicator supporting the respondents\u2019 case that the appellant fell off ladder\u00a03. This was understandable given the judge\u2019s finding that the spot on the level\u00a02 working platform where the appellant fell was fenced or barricaded. But we have in this judgment come to a different conclusion. In any case, accidents because of their very nature often happen in the most unlikely of ways. It is common experience that people sometimes perform feats by accident that they are unable to duplicate with deliberation. The judge herself acknowledged that the appellant could have been flailing around as he tried to save himself by grabbing something on the way down. This could have explained why he landed on his back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the conclusion reached in this appeal, there was no need for this court to consider the appellant\u2019s fall-back claim for relief under s\u00a033 of the WCA.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For these reasons, we allow the appeal to the extent that the appellant is entitled to 40% of the damages that are ultimately assessed as payable to him by the respondents. As for the costs here and below, we are of the view that the appellant is the successful party despite the apportionment of liability. The point is that the appellant\u2019s claim is not defeated by a finding of some fault on the part of the appellant in the light of s\u00a03(1) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap\u00a054, 2002\u00a0Rev Ed). In the court below, the judge had found that the appellant was entirely to blame for the accident. In contrast, we have found that he should bear only 60% of the blame. Accordingly, in the exercise of our discretion, we award the appellant full costs for this appeal and for the trial below. The security for costs furnished by the appellant is to be returned to the appellant or his solicitors.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Dr Tan was found 60% liable for the atrophy of both the testes of Mr Harte due to his post-operation negligence.<br/><br/>Mr Harte is dissatisfied with the quantum of damages awarded by the High Court and appeals to have the quantum enhanced. Dr Tan`s appeal relates to the order on costs. The basis for Dr Tan`s appeal hinges on an offer he made to settle and which far exceeded the sum which the court below eventually awarded to Mr Harte. Although chronologically Dr Tan`s notice of appeal was filed earlier, it is, however, expedient that we deal with Mr Harte`s appeal first.<br/><br/>At the trial below, Mr Harte had also sued the Gleneagles Hospital for being vicariously liable for the negligent acts of Dr Tan. It was clear on the evidence that Dr Tan was never an employee or agent of the hospital. Dr Tan ran his own private clinic. What he had was an arrangement with the hospital which allowed him to use its facilities for operating on his private patients. So there could be no question of the hospital being vicariously liable for the acts of Dr Tan. In any event, Mr Harte`s claim against the hospital failed because, as will be seen later, the operation carried out by Dr Tan in the hospital was held to be without fault. The atrophy of the testes of Mr Harte was brought about by post-operation causes which will be described later. The court below thus dismissed his claim against the hospital with costs. There is no appeal by Mr Harte against this dismissal.<br/><br/><strong><i> The background </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Mr Harte, now aged 37, is a citizen of the United States. In 1989 he married his wife, Mrs Michelle Lynn Harte. She is now 38. They were living in New York. About five years after their marriage, they decided to start a family. After trying for some two years, their wish could not be realised. So in April 1996, Mrs Harte consulted a gynaecologist, Dr James Jones, who in turn advised Mr Harte to see a urologist, Dr Lawrence Dubin.<br/><br/>The tests done by Dr Dubin showed that the quality of Mr Harte`s sperms was in a sub-fertile range. This was due to poor morphology. Dr Dubin suggested that Mr Harte undergo a surgical procedure known as a left varicocelectomy to improve the sperm quality. The object of this procedure was to reduce the pool of warm blood in the varicose veins surrounding the testes, which increased the temperature in the spermatogonia and decreased the efficiency with which they turned into spermatids. By ligating the appropriate number of varicose veins in the scrotum, the pool of warm blood would be removed due to the mechanism of thrombosis. The temperature in the testicular area thereby would be correspondingly lowered and fertility would be enhanced. In June 1996 Dr Dubin carried out the surgery.<br/><br/>At the relevant time, Mr Harte was working with a New York company, ED &amp; F Inc. In August, he was seconded by his company to work in Singapore as a trading manager with ED &amp; F Man Asia Pte Ltd. This move was a step upwards for him. Soon Mrs Harte joined him here. They continued to try to have a family but without success in spite of the procedure carried out by Dr Dubin.<br/><br/>In April 1997 Mr Harte consulted Dr Tan at the recommendation of Mrs Harte`s Singapore gynaecologist, Dr Winnie Wun. Dr Tan`s clinic was located at the Gleneagles Medical Centre, a building adjacent to Gleneagles Hospital. Dr Tan had an arrangement with Gleneagles Hospital whereby he could use the facilities of the hospital to carry out surgical operations on his private patients. As Mr Harte had informed Dr Tan that subsequent to Dr Dubin`s procedure no seminal analysis was carried out, Dr Tan suggested that that be done. The result of the analysis showed adequate volume of semen but `low percentage sperm mobility and low percentage normal forms, with high percentage tail defects`. This showed that Dr Dubin`s operation did not improve Mr Harte`s condition but in fact worsened it. The percentage of the normal form of his sperms had dropped from 15% to about 3%.<br/><br/>Dr Tan`s clinical examination of Mr Harte showed that there was no abnormality in his genitalia and there was no varicocele. He then used the Colour Doppler Ultrasound Scan (CPUS) to try to detect the cause or source of the infertility. The scan showed that intermittent varicoceles were noted on the left side and very early minimal intermittent varicoceles noted on the right side. The trial judge found that Dr Tan did inform Mr Harte of all these. On Dr Tan`s advice, Mr and Mrs Harte agreed to the bilateral varicocelectomy, it being in Dr Tan`s view the best option in the circumstances.<br/><br/>Dr Tan assured Mr and Mrs Harte that there would be no complications arising from the surgery other than some minor swelling and general discomfort  lasting for a few days. This was greatly comforting to Mr Harte as it meant that the side effects would be the same as those he experienced after the procedure in New York. However, the risk of atrophy was never mentioned to Mr and Mrs Harte. Be that as it may, the evidence showed that testicular atrophy was a remote consequence of such a simple surgery and the judge held that an omission to mention such a risk to Mr Harte did not constitute a negligent omission.<br/><br/>The bilateral varicocelectomy was carried out by Dr Tan on Mr Harte on 28 April 1997. The procedure lasted some one hour and twenty minutes. Thereafter, Mr Harte was wheeled to a recovery room in the day ward to rest.<br/><br/>An hour later in the recovery room a fateful event occurred. Against the advice of the hospital nurse, Ms Tan Seng Eng (`Ms Tan`), attending to him, and who brought him a urinal and also offered him a bed-pan, Mr Harte insisted on using the toilet. Mrs Harte said that she would accompany him. The nurse, Ms Tan, and Mrs Harte, helped Mr Harte to sit on the toilet bowl. The nurse then left the toilet, leaving Mrs Harte there with Mr Harte.<br/><br/>While seated on the toilet bowl, Mr Harte fainted and fell off the toilet bowl. Mrs Harte tried to hold him but failed because he is a very big person. As a result, Mr Harte`s head hit the floor first. Nurses were called to help him up and put him on the bed. Upon notification of the fall, Dr Tan sent a neurosurgeon, Dr Balaji Sadasivam, to examine his head. Dr Balaji did not examine the scrotum area. Mr Harte said that on that day, he felt pain at the bump on his head, but not in his testes or scrotum. By the evening of that day, as there did not appear to be any further complication, Dr Balaji, having seen Mr Harte, discharged him from the hospital. There was no evidence then that his testicles were traumatised because of the fall. At that point in time, it would not be possible to realise the injury which eventually occurred.<br/><br/>It must be mentioned that when Mr Harte was discharged, he felt discomfort at the scrotal area, though he could walk slowly. Mr Harte thought that that must be the normal effects of the surgery in the light of what Dr Tan told him earlier. By bedtime, there was some swelling at the scrotum area. Again, Mr Harte thought that that was the normal effect of the surgery.<br/><br/><strong><i> Post-operation care </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now come to the part where the court held Dr Tan to be wanting, that is, the post-operation care. The next morning, Mr Harte found that both his testes had swollen to what he felt was two to three times their normal size. The swelling was much more than what he experienced after the operation in New York by Dr Dubin. He further felt excruciating throbbing pain around his testicular area. At 9am Mr Harte called Dr Tan`s office but was told that he was busy. Eventually, Mr Harte spoke to Dr Tan and told the latter of how he felt. Dr Tan assured him that nothing needed be done, except to continue taking the prescribed pills and the swelling would subside. And so Mr Harte waited. But the swelling of his scotum got worse, about five to six times the normal size; and so did the pain.<br/><br/>On 30 April 1997, Mr Harte tried without success to speak to Dr Tan as the latter was away on a day trip to Kuala Lumpur. He made several calls because the  swelling and pain got worse. He spoke to Dr Tan`s nurse who told him to continue taking the pills and to come and see Dr Tan on 2 May 1997, 1 May 1997 being a public holiday.<br/><br/>The trial judge found that Dr Tan and/or his nurses should have, on 29 April 1997, asked Mr Harte to come to the clinic immediately for an examination.<br/><br/>By 2 May 1997, Mr Harte`s scrotum had grown to a size of about 7 inches/5 inches. It was agonising for him to walk, even with Mrs Harte`s assistance, to Dr Tan`s clinic. Dr Tan explained that Mr Harte had a scrotal haematoma and prescribed painkillers, antibiotics and anti-inflamatory medication to ease the pain and reduce swelling. And if the swelling persisted, he would draw the blood from his scrotum. Dr Tan did not inform Mr Harte that the haematoma could lead to the atrophy of his testes. Neither was an ultrasound scan carried out. The next appointment was fixed for 9 May. What is pertinent to note is that between 2 and 9 May 1997, Mr Harte was so concerned that he called Dr Tan`s clinic every day for advice. Still Dr Tan did not ask him to come and see him ahead of the next appointment.<br/><br/>On 9 May 1997, Dr Tan examined Mr Harte`s scrotum with the ultrasound machine. The swelling had started to subside although his scrotum was still hard. Because the swelling had subsided, Dr Tan did not think it necessary to draw out the blood from the scrotum.<br/><br/>By the time of the next consultation on 26 May 1997, all swelling had completely subsided. Dr Tan put Mr Harte on a three months` course of Povinorum, a drug containing a form of synthetic testosterone called mesteroline. However, Dr Tan did not explain to Mr Harte why he prescribed this drug. The judge thought that by this date Dr Tan knew that Mr Harte`s testes were irreparably damaged and could no longer produce sufficient testosterone. Neither did Dr Tan inform Mr Harte of this development.<br/><br/>On 29 August 1997, a seminal analysis revealed a dramatic reduction in the quantity and quality of his sperms, ie one million sperm per millilitre compared with 29 million in April 1997. A second seminal analysis a week later showed that there was no more sperm.<br/><br/>It was only on 9 October 1997, upon the inquiry of Mrs Harte, that Dr Tan explained that Mr Harte`s testes were not functioning properly. There was much dried blood in his scrotum. There was a small 3mm epididymal cyst on his left side. On 11 October 1997, Dr Tan dropped the bombshell to the Hartes that it was very unlikely that Mr Harte could ever father his own child.<br/><br/><strong><i> Consequential physical disabilities </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>As a result of all that had happened, the level of testosterone in his blood was reduced, causing him to lose, inter alia, his stamina and libido. But after obtaining testosterone replacement, his libido improved. By then his right testicle had shrunk from 25cc to 6cc and his left from 15cc to 8cc. The testicles, having atrophied, are now permanently damaged and cannot produce sperm or testosterone. He can no longer father any child. Understandably this devastated  him and also caused great pain to his wife. Further tests showed that his left testis could not produce any mature sperm but just some spermatids (ie immature sperm). His right testicle produced not even spermatids - it was completely non-functional.<br/><br/>Dr Schlegel, an Associate Professor of Urology at Cornell University and Visiting Associate Physician at Rockefeller University Hospital in New York, advised that he might be able to extract sperm from his left testis (`TESE`) and attempt the intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedure (`ICSI`) to fertilise one of Mrs Harte`s eggs. This might require several attempts to be successful. Dr Schlegel was hopeful.<br/><br/><strong><i> Findings of the trial judge </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The position taken by Dr Tan was that he did not encounter any problem in the course of the surgery on Mr Harte. The operation was uneventful. He attributed the scrotum haematoma to the fall sustained by Mr Harte in the toilet. The fall caused an impact on the scrotum, resulting in the very sensitive veins in the testes to burst and bleed.<br/><br/>It was common ground between the experts of both parties that bilateral testicular atrophy was not likely to occur following bilateral varicocelectomy unless the surgeon had not performed the surgery with sufficient care or he was simply incompetent.<br/><br/>The trial judge went into a very detailed analysis of the medical evidence touching on the cause of the atrophy. It is clear that the atrophy was caused by a vascular event, meaning the blood supply to the testes had been compromised (ie reduced). There was the evidence of Dr Richard Notley (for Mr Harte) that a wholly unnecessary operation was done by Dr Tan, as the varicocele in the left testis had been removed by Dr Dubin in New York and there was no varicocele in the right testis. Dr Tan carried on the operation based on an assumption. However, this view of Dr Notley was not accepted by the trial judge.<br/><br/>Touching on the operation, the judge found that Dr Tan had adopted the correct procedure and had exercised reasonable care in relation thereto. Mr Harte`s contention, that it was due to an excessive division of veins by Dr Tan which caused the devascularisation, was rejected by the judge who held that Dr Tan had, in fact, left all the arteries, including the vasal artery, intact. Neither did he ligate and divide the vasal vein. There was blood supply to and sufficient venous drainage from both his testes.<br/><br/>We ought to mention that Mr Harte had also speculated or postulated various possibilities in which Dr Tan could have botched the operation and caused the dead testes. The judge, by a process of elimination, rejected all of them as without any foundation.<br/><br/>From a thorough examination of the medical evidence, the judge came to the conclusion that Mr Harte did suffer from extratesticular (scrotal) haematoma besides an internal haematoma and that the cause of both was physical contusion rather than surgery. That contusion occurred when Mr Harte collapsed and his  scrotum pressed against the side of the toilet seat. It was a fairly hard squeeze. In coming to this determination he went into a careful examination of how the collapse of Mr Harte could have caused the contusion on the scrotum and the testes. For this purpose, he had the assistance of two associate professors from the engineering schools at NTU and NUS, who gave various projections based on science as to how the fall from the toilet seat could have caused the injuries to the scrotum and the testes. The judge also bore in mind the fact that the toilet bowl on which Mr Harte was seated was smaller than his large frame and his scrotum was slightly swollen because of the operation. This was how the judge described the situation ([para ]394):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Since Mr Harte fell from a most vulnerable position when his slightly swollen scrotum after the operation was hanging deepest in the toilet bowl, the forward movement of the body during the fall would push his penis and scrotum to be jammed between the perineum and pelvic bone on the top, and the hard but smooth upper surface of the toilet seat at the bottom, whilst hemmed in at the same time by the inner thighs on both sides. The resultant effect is a fairly hard squeezing of the testicles on all sides for a short duration when his heavy body moved forward and fell eventually, pulling along with it and crushing the scrotum and testes as they passed over the smooth edged toilet seat, which consequently resulted in the contusion injury.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The judge found that the swelling of the scrotum and the pain were due to the contusion. His fall caused his rather large scrotum to be caught and squashed between his body and the top of the toilet seat. The contusion involved only a moderate non-impact force - a gradual squeezing of the testes, as his heavy body rolled over his scrotum during the fall off the toilet seat. The resulting pain arising from this rolling over was probably not acute and would have diminished quickly. Therefore, it was not realised by Mr Harte by the time he regained consciousness. But it probably caused internal microvascular damage within the testicular tissues. The micro bleeding caused the intratesticular haematoma to swell and stretch the intact tunica albuginea, and then the pain would be felt gradually.<br/><br/>The judge did not find Dr Tan to be wanting in exercising due care by not seeing Mr Harte on the day before his discharge from hospital. This is because, in his view, it would have made no difference as Dr Tan would not have been able to diagnose a potentially dangerous intratesticular haematoma developing at that stage, especially when Mr Harte had not complained of any serious pain and there were no obvious signs of bruising or swelling of the scrotum area.<br/><br/>But the judge found that Dr Tan exercised less than reasonable care when he failed to see Mr Harte immediately after being informed of the swelling and the pain on the next day, 29 April 1997. Dr Tan also did not exercise due care when he saw Mr Harte on 2 May 1997 as he should have investigated further into the swelling like using the ultrasound machine, which he did only on 9 May 1997. This test was essential in the light of the fact that the scrotum swelled to the size of a mango, with the testes not palpable. This latter condition indicated all the more of the need for an ultrasound investigation to ascertain the existence of intratesticular haematoma.<br/><br/>The haematoma disrupted the blood flow to the testes, thereby depriving the testes of the oxygen they required to function. This resulted in the tissues in the testes dying, leading to atrophy.<br/><br/>The judge seemed to hold that there were two contributory causes of the atrophy: the fall and the post-operation negligence. Liability was apportioned 40:60 in favour of Mr Harte.<br/><br/><strong><i> Assessment of damages </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The judge quantified the damages for the injuries suffered. Based on 100% liability, he awarded Mr Harte a total of S$50,000 for general damages in respect of pain and suffering, made up as follows:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Large haematoma for four days</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">2,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Complete loss of fertility, bearing in mind that he was sub-fertile before the incident</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">20,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Partial penile impotence and impaired libido</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">13,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Atrophy of both testicles</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">10,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Increased risk of liver cancer from long term testosterone therapy and an awareness of a shortened lifespan</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">5,000</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>As for special damages, Mr Harte claimed under a number of items. The judge disallowed Mr Harte`s claims for medical expenses incurred before and for the operation itself because Dr Tan was not negligent in respect of the advice he gave before the operation and for the operation itself. However, he granted in respect of:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(1)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">local medical expenses post-operation</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">S$4,992.70</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(2)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">overseas medical expenses post-operation</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">US$4,982.08</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>But he did not allow Mr Harte`s claim on expenses incurred on air travel to the United States for fertility treatment. The reason for this decision was because those trips were undertaken as part of home leave or on business and the expenses were paid by the company. The obtaining of treatment on those trips was incidental. This disallowance is not challenged before us.<br/><br/>However, the judge only allowed partially Mr Harte`s claims for future cost of fertility treatment which would involve two procedures, namely, TESE (testicular sperm extraction) and ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection), to be undertaken at Cornell University Medical Centre, New York. He allowed three cycles (Mr Harte claimed 10) of the TESE procedure at US$7,000 each, plus other expenses and pain and inconvenience on account of this and gave a total award of US$30,000 for the item.<br/><br/>However, as regards the cost for the ICSI procedure, the judge held that even if Mr Harte did not suffer any testicular atrophy, the ICSI procedure would still be needed. This was because his sperms, being so weak, would not likely be able to fertilise his wife`s eggs. Thus, assistance would be required in any event.<br/><br/>The judge did not allow Mr Harte`s claim for loss of earnings, estimated by Mr Harte at $2.4m. This was allegedly on account of his having to give up his job in Singapore and return to United States in order that he might obtain the TESE-ICSI treatment at Cornell University Medical Centre so that his wife could  conceive their child. The judge found that the Hartes wanted to go back to New York on their own volition. He also found that there was no evidence that his employer had decided to extend his assignment in Singapore upon the completion of his three-year term. Moreover, even if the Hartes were to undertake the TESE-ICSI treatment, it would not have required him and his wife to be stationed in New York. They could make short trips to New York for this purpose.<br/><br/>Finally, in respect of an item on the cost of hormone replacement therapy, he allowed it at US$1,828.48p[thinsp]a until Mr Harte reached the age of 60. Bearing in mind that there was accelerated payment, and applying a discount rate of 5%p[thinsp]a, he arrived at the global figure of US$25,230, which he rounded up to US$26,000.<br/><br/>Except for the claims for cost of future treatment/therapy, interest was awarded in respect of the other items, for sums in Singapore dollars at 3%p[thinsp]a and US dollars 5%, from the date of the writ.<br/><br/><strong><i> Mr Harte`s appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>As mentioned before, Mr Harte`s appeal is only in relation to the quantum of damages awarded. However, before going into the consideration of the individual items of claim which are being challenged, either on the ground of the quantum being so low or that it was unjustifiably disallowed, there is a need for us to consider Mr Harte`s general contention that the court was wrong to have discounted the assessed amount of damages by 40%. This discount was made by the judge following his finding that, had there been `prompt intervention by Dr Tan on the morning after the surgery, perhaps 60% of Mr Harte`s testes may be saved from atrophy`.<br/><br/>Mr Harte`s contention goes as follows: if 60% of his testes could have been saved, but for Dr Tan`s negligence, that would mean that the testes would still have retained much of their normal functions, as the 40% atrophy of the testes, which was attributed by the court to Mr Harte himself, would not have caused the testes to lose their functional capabilities. Furthermore, as Mr Harte`s testes were much larger than the average man, a saving of 60% of his testes must therefore mean that there was more than an even chance of saving the functional capabilities of the testes.<br/><br/>It seems to us that this contention is wholly without any foundation. It is true that if a person has one good testis and a damaged testis, he is still capable of producing sperm to father a child. But it is wholly erroneous to infer from that that if both testes were damaged up to 50%, that person is in the same position as one who has one good testis and one bad testis. There is no parallel between the two situations. One does not follow from the other. The extent to which the functions of a human organ are damaged is not a matter upon which a conclusion may be drawn based on mathematical calculation or analogy. There is simply no evidence before the court to show how effective the testes would be, if the atrophy suffered by the testes of Mr Harte were 60% less than they now are. Moreover, there is also no evidence to indicate that a bigger testis is more resilient functionally than a normal or smaller sized one.<br/><br/>Reliance is placed by Mr Harte on the case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1987]  AC 750</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1987] 2 All ER 909</font> where a boy aged 13 fell from a tree and suffered an acute traumatic fracture of the epiphysis of the left thigh bone. Because of an erroneous diagnosis, the injury remained untreated for five days, and it developed into avascular necrosis of the femoral apiphysis, a disability of the hip joint. The trial judge found that even if prompt and correct treatment had been given, there was still a 75% chance that avascular necrosis would have developed. The trial judge awarded the plaintiff 25% of the assessed damage for the disability and it was affirmed on appeal. However, the House of Lords reversed that decision and held that no damages were payable as the plaintiff had not proven causation. Once causation was proven then the defendant would be liable for the entire injury. As Lord Ackner said ([1987] AC 750 at 793; [1987] 2 All ER 909 at 922):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Once liability is established, on the balance of probabilities, the loss which the plaintiff has sustained is payable in full. It is not discounted by reducing his claim by the extent to which he has failed to prove his case with 100 per cent certainty.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It is settled law that in a personal injuries claim, the plaintiff must always establish that the act/omission of the defendant is the cause, or a cause, of the injuries. Causation must be proved on the balance of probabilities. In a case where it is proved that there were several causes, then the court is bound to determine the extent to which each cause contributed to the injuries.<br/><br/>We do not propose to go into the other cases which have been cited to us. In each instance it is a question of fact. Reverting to the instant case we note that throughout the trial, Mr Harte proceeded on only one basis, namely, that Dr Tan botched up the operation and was, therefore, wholly responsible for the resulting incapacity. While Dr Tan did, during the course of the trial, raise the issue that the incapacity was due to the collapse of Mr Harte while sitting on the toilet bowl, there was hardly any evidence led by Mr Harte as to Dr Tan`s post-operation care and on how this lack of care had contributorily caused the incapacity of the testes.<br/><br/>While the trial judge did not, in his judgment, expressly find that Dr Tan`s post-operation negligence caused the atrophy of the two testes, that must be implied, as he held that had prompt attention been given by Dr Tan to Mr Harte`s complaint, 60% of the testes might have been saved. But, as mentioned before, there is no medical evidence before the court to indicate how incapable or unproductive the two testes would have become had they been damaged or atrophied only to the extent of 40%. There is nothing to show that the rate of deterioration of the capability of a testis corresponds directly with the extent of its atrophy. The finding of the trial judge on this seems to assume that the rate of deterioration of a testis would be that of a straight line. The truth is there is no answer obtainable from the evidence before the court.<br/><br/>The evidence of Dr Schlegel suggested that permanent injury will set in within four to six hours of the contusion to the testes. Similarly, Dr Notley was pessimistic about the chances of salvaging the testicular tissues even if Dr Tan had intervened promptly with proper medical treatment. Both these experts were Mr Harte`s witnesses. The evidence of Dr Tay Kah Phuan, a defence witness, seemed to be consistent with that of Dr Notley, when he expressed the view that  where an injury to the testis resulted from trauma, tissues in the testicles would die in any event notwithstanding any efforts to save them. On this evidence, the atrophy could not be said to have been caused by Dr Tan.<br/><br/>It would appear that in coming to his conclusion the judge relied mainly on the evidence of Prof Li Man Kay. But Prof Li`s opinion was really quite tentative. On being asked about the chances of Mr Harte`s testes being saved, if prompt treatment had been given by Dr Tan, he really only hazarded a guess when he said `I would assume that there will be fifty-fifty chance`. It is also not entirely clear, when Prof Li stated that there could be a 50-50 chance of saving the testes, what he meant. Did he mean saving such that there would be no reduction in the functional capabilities of the testes? That was not explored.<br/><br/>It is also not clear to us how the judge arrived at his conclusion that, had prompt attention been given by Dr Tan, perhaps 60% of Mr Harte`s testes might have been saved from atrophy. It seems to us that what the judge probably did was first to randomly increase the chances of saving the testes by 10% to 60% (it appears this increase has no evidential basis) and, secondly, taking a broad brush approach, to assume that if there was a 60% chance of saving the testes from atrophy it would mean that the extent of the atrophy would accordingly be lessened by 60%. Of course, the critical question is not the extent of the atrophy but the extent to which any degree of atrophy would affect the functional capabilities of the testes. In our view, the correct question should be: would a testis which is atrophied by up to 40% (for which Mr Harte is responsible) be completely destroyed? Could it be saved so that it could function normally? If not, what would be its remaining capabilities? Perhaps, the judge was merely seeking to achieve broad justice in all the circumstances.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, and most importantly, Dr Tan has not appealed against that finding. Neither has he appealed against the quantum of damages awarded against him. As for Mr Harte`s appeal, apart from questioning the specific quantum given in respect of each item of claim, or challenging those items which the judge had disallowed, he contends that, following <strong><i> Hotson </i></strong> (supra), the discount of 40% from the quantum should not be made. He is not challenging the finding that Mr Harte himself caused 40% of the atrophy.<br/><br/>The burden of proof as to the extent of disability or incapacity suffered by a plaintiff rests with him. In the light of what has been discussed above, it could be said that Mr Harte had not proven causation. <strong><i> Hotson </i></strong> (supra) is in fact against Mr Harte. What is in his favour is that passage cited in [para ]46 above. This is because strictly, a 50-50 chance does not constitute sufficient proof on the balance of probabilities. On that basis, the award of 60% of the assessed damages to Mr Harte is thus more than what he is entitled to.<br/><br/>We should state that <strong><i> Hotson </i></strong> (supra) and this case are clearly reconcilable. In <strong><i> Hotson </i></strong>, the question addressed by the House was whether the hospital authorities` negligence caused the avascular necrosis. As the medical opinion tendered showed that even if proper treatment had been given, there was a 75% probability that the disability would have set in, the House of Lords held that it was not proved, on the balance of probabilities, that the doctors` negligence caused that disability. In our case, the judge found that Mr Harte`s collapse, while sitting on  the toilet bowl, caused contusion of the testes. That was a direct cause of the atrophy. What the judge also found was that the extent of the atrophy could have been reduced by 60% if not for the post-operation negligence of Dr Tan. So what that means is that the atrophy of both testes of Mr Harte had two contributory causes - the fall and lack of prompt post-operation treatment. On this basis, we think the judge is correct to have awarded Mr Harte only 60% of the assessed damages.<br/><br/>There would have been a parallel between <strong><i> Hotson </i></strong> (supra) and this case if the judge had found that even if Dr Tan had rendered prompt medical attention to Mr Harte the chances of saving his testes from being so atrophied was, say, only 25%. But in this latter event, following <strong><i> Hotson </i></strong>, Dr Tan would not have been held to have caused the atrophy.<br/><br/>There is a final point we would like to make about <strong><i> Hotson </i></strong> (supra). If causation had been proven there, ie that prompt action <strong><i> would have prevented the onset of avascular necrosis </i></strong>, then it is perfectly understandable why their Lordships held that the defendant should have to pay the full amount of the damages for that disability. This was not what the judge below found in this case. Here, the judge was saying that even in the absence of the post-operation negligence, there would have been 40% atrophy of the testes.<br/><br/>The situation here, as determined by the judge, is not unlike that in an ordinary motor accident claim. The law reports and the court records are littered with cases where the courts had in those cases found the plaintiff 25% to blame and the defendant 75% to blame and damages sustained were accordingly apportioned. In some of the cases the plaintiffs were to be blamed for even less than 25%. In every of these cases, it would mean that the court had found there were more than one contributory cause to the accident and had apportioned fault accordingly. Here, the judge found that both Mr Harte and Dr Tan had caused the eventual atrophy of the testes and went on to apportion liability at 40-60, in favour of Mr Harte.<br/><br/><strong><i> General damages </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>On the award of general damages made by the judge, Mr Harte contends that the judge only took into account `pain and suffering` and not the `loss of amenities`, such as his feeling of lethargy and the loss of libido. We do not think this criticism is valid and may be disposed of shortly. This head of damage `pain and suffering and loss of amenities` is sometimes referred to simply as `pain and suffering`. To say that the judge had not given anything for `loss of amenities` is to ignore the sum of $13,000 given for `partial penile impotence and impaired libido`. It is, therefore, clear to us that the judge had used the term `pain and suffering` to also include `loss of amenities`. However, such a form of abbreviation without further explanation, especially in a written judgment, should be avoided altogether in order to prevent the sort of arguments raised by Mr Harte here.<br/><br/><strong><i> Ariffin bin Omar v Goh Beng Kee </i></strong><strong><i> Ng Hock Chye v Singapore Shuttle Bus </i></strong><strong><i> Yeap Boon Onn v Neo Hui Nee </i></strong>It is true that the judge did not give any reasons for the various sums he awarded under general damages. We agree that there should be a fair measure of consistency between awards for similar injuries/incapacities. Mr Raj Singam for  Mr Harte, relied upon the following five cases to show that the overall quantum of $50,000 awarded is too low:   </p>\n    <p>(1) In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Low Swee Tong v Liew Machinery</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1993:3:89:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1993:3:89:\">  [1993] 3 SLR 89 </a>, the High Court awarded $45,000 for impotence. </p>\n    <p>(2) In  (Suit 1603/88), our High Court awarded $55,000 for rupture of urethra and impotence. </p>\n    <p>(3) In  (Suit 442/89), our High Court awarded $40,000 for penile impotence. </p>\n    <p>(4) In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978)</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1984-1985::10:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1984-1985::10:\">  [1984-1985] SLR 10 </a><a href=\"MLJ:1984:1:325:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1984:1:325:\">  [1984] 1 MLJ 325 </a>, the plaintiff was awarded $45,000 for pain and suffering in respect of his inability to have sexual intercourse. In addition, she was given $40,000 for the loss of amenities (to have a marriage and family). </p>\n    <p>(5) In  (MC Suit 14442/97), the magistrate court awarded $15,000 for the atrophy of a testicle, without loss of sexual function.<br/><br/>While it may be difficult to compare one set of injuries with another, though they may be similar, Mr Harte`s condition seems to be more serious than any of the above cases. The main disabilities which he now suffers are:   </p>\n    <p>(1) the atrophy of both testes; </p>\n    <p>(2) loss of ability to produce sperms (admittedly before the operation by Dr Tan, the quality of his sperms was below normal); </p>\n    <p>(3) complete loss of capacity to produce testosterone which gave rise to, inter alia, loss of masculinity, loss of libido, and the need to have hormone replacement therapy which treatment over the long term could give rise to an increased risk of liver cancer; </p>\n    <p>(4) the need to resort to TESE and ICSI procedures in order that Mr Harte may have a chance of fathering a child.<br/><br/>While modern medical science has found a cure for impotency, there is as yet no discovery which would enable a dead testis to produce sperm or testosterone. We further agree with Mr Singam`s submission that taking the award in <strong><i> Yeap Boon Onn </i></strong> as an example, it does not follow because the atrophy of one testis attracted an award of $15,000 that the amount to be awarded for the atrophy of both testes would only be twice. The devastating effect of the loss of both testes must be given due consideration. As mentioned above, a man with one good testis can still father a child. A man with both testes dead cannot do that. Even a man who is really impotent can father a child by artificial insemination.<br/><br/>Taking into consideration the amounts awarded in those cases referred to by Mr Singam and all the circumstances here, including the fact that Mr Harte`s loss is not just one testis but two and yet, on the other hand, he was before the operation already infertile to a fair extent, we are of the opinion that the amount awarded by the trial judge was clearly on the low side and ought to be enhanced. We would accordingly enhance the amount for general damages to $120,000, made up as follows:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Atrophy of both testes and complete loss of fertility</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">60,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Partial penile impotence and impaired libido</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">45,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Increased risk of liver cancer on account of testosterone treatment</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">10,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Some several days of suffering on account of the scrotum haematoma</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">5,000</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We would add that if Mr Harte had, before the accident, been a normal fertile man, then the sum we would have awarded would be more than what we have given above.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a point of policy which Mr Singam has raised before us. He said the courts in Singapore should follow the approaches adopted by the courts in Hong Kong and England (see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Chan Pui Ki v Leung On</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1996] 2 HKLR 401</font> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Heil v Rankin</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[2000] 3 All ER 138</font>) of making a general upward revision of all awards to reflect the current improved social and economic conditions in the country. In<strong><i> Heil v Rankin </i></strong>, a specially empanelled quorum of five judges of the English Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that the awards for the most serious of injuries needed to be increased by about one-third and a lesser margin of increase for the less serious injuries.<br/><br/>We accept the principle that the compensation to be awarded to a victim must be fair, reasonable and just. We also recognise the fact that no amount of compensation can really make up for the loss of an organ or a limb. The law seeks to do the best it can, using money as the medium, of striking a balance between the interests of the individual and the overall interest of the society. However, we do not think this is an appropriate occasion to undertake a general review of the tariff for personal injuries. There will be socio-economic implications. This court does not have the essential data to help it to come to an informed conclusion. We have only a brief submission by Mr Harte`s counsel. However, we wish to point out that a perusal of some of the awards made by the courts over the years indicate that awards for the same injury have risen.<br/><br/>But in so far as the present case is concerned, we are of the opinion that the award for general damages is inadequate and have accordingly revised it upwards as indicated above.<br/><br/><strong><i> Expenses incurred for the operation </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now turn to Mr Harte`s claim for special damages. The judge below disallowed the claim for expenses incurred by Mr Harte before the operation as well as for the operation. His main reason for the decision was that as he found Dr Tan not to be negligent in carrying out the operation and as the haematoma of the testes and the scrotum was caused by Mr Harte`s fall from the toilet bowl, those expenses should be borne by him.<br/><br/>Mr Singam argued that Dr Tan`s post-operation negligence effectively removed all the benefits that Mr Harte had received from Dr Tan before and during the surgery. He gave this example and we will quote him verbatim:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>A man sends his car to a mechanic to be repaired. The mechanic completes the repairs, and he draws up an invoice for S$5,000. The mechanic`s last duty is to drive the car back to the man`s house. In this process, the mechanic drives negligently and wrecks the car, rendering it totally inoperable and unsalvageable. The man has totally lost the benefit of his car being repaired. Because of the negligence of the mechanic, there is  now no car to speak of. Should the man still pay the mechanic the S$5,000 for repairing his car?</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We do not think this example is apt. In that example there was no intervening act on the part of the owner. Here, there was: Mr Harte`s fall from the toilet bowl, and the judge`s finding that the fall caused a contusion to the scrotum, which in turn caused the haematoma in the testes and the scrotum. Unlike the example given, it was the act of Mr Harte which negated the work done by Dr Tan. With respect, we think counsel missed this angle. Dr Tan should only be liable for his own act/omission and nothing more.<br/><br/>Even in the example given, while the car owner need not pay for the repairs effected by the mechanic, he cannot, in claiming for damages for the loss of the car, claim for the value of a good working car. If he claims for the value of a good working car, then he must pay the mechanic the costs of the repair or a deduction be made for that. Otherwise, he would be unjustly enriched.<br/><br/><strong><i> Loss of future earnings </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>This item of claim is based on the premise that had Mr Harte stayed on and worked in Singapore he would have enjoyed the very attractive expatriate package which was extended to him by his Singapore employer, which included a higher salary and other perks like housing and a car. Because of what happened, he had to return to New York and to a lower paying job. In the court below he claimed for the loss of earnings, being the difference between what he earned in New York and what he would have earned if he had remained in Singapore, for up to 15 years. Before us, he is asking only for five years. Mr Harte said that he and his wife had to leave Singapore for two main reasons. First, this place brought back all the bad memories relating to this terrible episode. The Hartes hoped that by leaving Singapore it would reduce the mental and emotional pain and suffering they experienced due to Dr Tan`s negligence. By returning to the United States they would also be among friends and relatives who would be able to help them overcome their pain. Second, in order that the TESE-ICSI procedures may be carried out by Dr Schlegel of the Cornell University Medical Centre, they needed to be in the United States.<br/><br/>The trial judge noted that their decision to return to the United States was based on the premise that it was Dr Tan`s negligence which caused Mr Harte to be in the state in which he found himself in. This assumption, in the light of what the judge found, is no longer correct. Second, he held that Mr Harte has not proven on the balance of probabilities that he would have been offered employment in Singapore for a long time but for his need for fertility treatment in New York under the charge of Dr Schlegel. Third, he found that if it were true that Mr Harte`s Singapore employer would have offered him an extended term in Singapore, then he should have stayed on. If he had opted to remain in Singapore, he could always fly to New York to receive the fertility treatment, although this would involve some inconvenience, because of the distance. He had a duty to mitigate. The judge further added:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I regard his resignation to take up a lower paying job in New York so that he could go for a few day surgeries (spread out perhaps over 2 or 3 years) as most unreasonable.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>He also found that the Hartes decided to return to New York on their own volition.<br/><br/>It is clear from the evidence of both the Hartes, particularly Mrs Harte, that they could not stand to live in Singapore any further. Moreover, they would like to have the fertility treatment administered by Dr Schlegel. The idea of obtaining that treatment was first suggested to them in Cabrini Medical Centre Pathology Consultation Report of 27 October 1998 which stated that:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In the United States, at New York Hospital, Drs Goldstein and Schlegel have reported that (they) are able to remove sperm from testicles such as yours and together with intracytoplasmic sperm insertion, achieve pregnancies and embryoes. You might want to consult with them. My own opinion at the moment is extremely guarded in that area.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Therefore, counsel for Mr Harte argued that returning to the United States in order to get the required treatment so that the Hartes could have a child of their own should be considered to be a step taken by Mr Harte to mitigate the injury caused by Dr Tan. A necessary cost of undertaking this mitigating step would involve his leaving his job here, and the consequential loss of his attractive pay package. Mr Singam relied on the case  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The World Beauty</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1970]  P 144</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1969] 3 All ER 158</font> where Winn LJ said ([1970] P 144 at 156; [1969] 3 All ER 158 at 163):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... it is implicit in the principle, that if mitigating steps are reasonably taken and additional loss or damage results notwithstanding the reasonable decision to take those steps, then that will be in addition to the recoverable damage and not a set-off against the amount of it.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>As we see it, Mr Harte will have to satisfy two conditions before he could succeed on this item of claim. First, he must show that his Singapore employer had agreed to extend or was likely to extend his assignment in Singapore. Second, if the first condition is met, whether it was reasonable for Mr Harte to leave such a good paying job so that he could receive the TESE-ICSI treatment by Dr Schlegel in New York.<br/><br/>On the first condition, the evidence came mainly from Mr Trevor Johnson, the Managing Director of ED &amp; F Man Asia Pte Ltd (Mr Harte`s Singapore employer), who found Mr Harte to be a very good employee, hardworking and motivated, and should be the person to take over his job. He would have extended Mr Harte`s term in Singapore. He also said that he recruited one Mr Hutchinson from London, not to take over from Mr Harte but to `strengthen the team`. He asked Mr Harte to stay on for another three months after the expiry of his three-year term in order that there would be a period of overlap between Mr Harte leaving and Hutchinson joining the company.<br/><br/>Understandably, Mr Johnson was sympathetic to the plight of Mr Harte, having regard to the pain and disappointment the latter had to endure. Of course, at the time he gave evidence he was under the impression that all of Mr Harte`s misery was brought about because Dr Tan botched the operation. In any event, there is no concrete evidence to show that ED &amp; F New York had even considered extending the secondment of Mr Harte in Singapore. The documents discovered shows that Mr Harte was seconded to Singapore for three years only `after which  (Mr Harte) will return to the US`. In a further letter of 25 May 1997, his Singapore employer stated:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Further to our recent discussions, this letter clarifies the Terms and Conditions on which you are seconded to ED &amp; F Man Cocoa (Singapore) Pte Ltd (The \"Company\") based in Singapore for a period of approximately three years. <strong> The assignment commenced on 1st August, 1996. At the termination of this secondment you will revert to your ED &amp; F Man Inc contract</strong>. [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>There is no further correspondence about extending the secondment from either his New York employer or the Singapore employer. The judge further noted the fact that Mr Hutchinson was engaged and assumed office (in July 1999) even before the term of Mr Harte had expired. This would necessarily mean that the recruitment exercise, culminating in the engagement of Mr Hutchinson, must have been initiated sometime before that. There is no document which indicates that the company would have liked Mr Harte`s secondment be extended but for his medical needs. The evidence also suggests that no serious consultation was made with Dr Schlegel to experiment with the TESE-ICSI procedures until the second half of 1999.<br/><br/>The truth of the matter is that after the full extent of Mr Harte`s injury became apparent in October 1997, Mrs Harte felt depressed and started to `hate Singapore and anything associated with it`. It seems to us clear that that was the real reason for them leaving Singapore upon the expiry of the contract. However attractive the expatriate package was, it was of no significance and no thought was given to that. Mr Harte thus did not seek any extension. He stayed on for a further three months to help Mr Hutchinson get acquainted with his job.<br/><br/>Having considered all the circumstances, there is really no basis for us to dissent from the finding of the court below that the Hartes left these shores on their own free will and on the expiry of his secondment term. They did not seek any extension. Neither was there any consultation between the Singapore employer and the New York employer, to extend his secondment in Singapore. In view of this determination, it follows that the first condition has not been proved. Therefore, it is not necessary for us to consider whether the second condition spelt out in [para ]76 has been met.<br/><br/><strong><i> Future medical expenses </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong> ICSI PROCEDURE</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>As mentioned before, the trial judge disallowed this claim because it was a procedure which was needed in any case as Mr Harte`s sperms did not have the `ability to do what they are supposed to do`. Mr Singam submitted that here the judge had gone wrong in a fundamental respect. The purpose of undergoing the bilateral varicocelectomy was precisely to improve the quality of his sperms. As the operation was successful (but for the fall and the lack of post-operation care extended by Dr Tan) and based on Dr Tan`s opinion and on the studies which were placed before the court, there should be more than an even chance that Mr Harte`s sperm quality would have improved. That would mean that there was probably no  necessity for Mrs Harte to have to undergo ICSI, or any assisted means of fertilisation in order to achieve pregnancy.<br/><br/>We accept that this contention of counsel is logical and reasonable. The judge should have allowed the expenses relating to the ICSI procedure which costs US$16,000 per cycle.<br/><br/>A related item of claim made by Mr Harte, and which was not addressed by the judge, was the medication which is required prior to the TESE-ICSI procedures. This medication is required for both Mr and Mrs Harte and it would stretch over a period of five months before the procedure. The cost for each such five-month medication course amounts to US$7,028.25 per person. This should have been allowed.<br/><br/>The final argument raised by counsel on this item relates to the number of TESE-ICSI cycles which should have been allowed. The court below gave three cycles for TESE. Counsel refers to the fact that the first attempt undergone by the Hartes in October 2000 failed. The attempt was aborted because Mrs Harte had not produced sufficient eggs for the procedure to succeed.<br/><br/>In coming to his conclusion as to the number of TESE cycles that needed to be provided, the judge took into account the fact that frozen sperm could be stored indefinitely without any degradation in the sperm quality and that there was a risk associated with multiple incisions on the tunica albuginea of the testes, as repeated TESE attempts may cause permanent ischaemic testicular injury. Indeed Dr Schlegel told the court that if he failed in his first attempt to find any sperm, he would not make any further attempts.<br/><br/>The trial judge had given careful consideration to the matter before he came to the conclusion that only three cycles of the TESE should be allowed. This is fair, as sperm may be stored. But the same does not apply to the ICSI procedure. There is nothing to be saved. If a cycle of ICSI failed, it has to be started again. Accordingly, we would increase the allowable cycles of the ICSI procedure for Mrs Harte to five.<br/><br/><strong> HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</strong></p>\n    <p>On this item of claim, Mr Singam contends that the award given by the trial judge is erroneous in three respects. First, the judge was wrong to hold that Mr Harte should only be required to see his endocrinologist once every six months. However, in accordance with US law, the endocrinologist can only prescribe one-month dosage of testosterone at a time, as it is an anabolic steroid. So Mr Harte has no option in the matter. There has to be 12 consultations a year. Second, there is clear evidence that Mr Harte has to go for blood test once every three months to monitor the risk of cancer. There is no evidence to suggest that quarterly blood test is unreasonable. Indeed the judge was under the mistaken impression that Mr Harte was asking for monthly blood test. Third, the judge was wrong to have provided this therapy to Mr Harte only up to the age of 60. He was also wrong not to have applied the straight line calculation in determining the amount which should be allowed under this item; no discount should have been made.<br/><br/>In the respondent`s case, no answer was offered as to the foregoing. In our opinion, there is clear validity in the first two arguments made by counsel. We would allow the sum US$2,957.20p[thinsp]a, being the fees for 12 consultations and the sum of US$640p[thinsp]a, being the costs for quarterly blood tests. The drug cost per annum (not disputed) is US$1,421.88. Thus the total annual cost for the hormone therapy is US$5,019.08.<br/><br/>As regards the third argument, the trial judge in providing hormone therapy only up to the age of 60, took into account the various contingencies of life, such as, early death due to illness or accident. While we agree that the judge was entitled, in this exercise, to take into account the various contingencies of life, it must also be borne in mind that the average lifespan of human beings has improved over the years. With better living conditions and medical care, people nowadays do live longer. Thus, we think, the provision by the trial judge is on the low side and would instead provide that the hormone therapy be continued until Mr Harte attains the age of 65.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is the point relating to the discount made by the judge on the lump sum awarded under this item. The basis for making that discount was, in the words of the judge, `to take account of the accelerated payment of a lump sum at the present value`. The judge adopted the discount rate of 5%, it being `an estimate of future long term bank interest rates in the United States`. This worked out to a multiplier of 14.2 instead of a straight multiplier of 24 (from age 36 to 60).<br/><br/>Counsel for Mr Harte argued that there should be no deduction as the costs of medication would probably go up in later years due to inflation. The bank interest earned on the lump sum would be offset by inflation. This court recognises that there will be inflation in so far as the cost of obtaining of medical services is concerned, eg consultations and blood tests. But even as regards the cost of drugs, we doubt the cost will really go down. With rapid advancements made in medical sciences, perhaps more potent or effective drugs may be discovered. But this may not necessarily lead to lowering of costs. Indeed, research and development (which involves human effort) is an expensive venture.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, we should be awarding to Mr Harte a sum which would adequately provide for his needs for hormone therapy, taking into account both factors, namely, the interest which an advance payment would earn and the fact that there will be inflation as far as the costs of medical services are concerned. We think it is probably more equitable that the rate of discount to be adopted should be adjusted downwards from 5% to 3%. This would increase the multiplier to 19.6.<br/><br/>Therefore, the award for the cost of hormone therapy should be US$98,373.97 which we take it to be US$98,374.<br/><br/>In the result the appeal of Mr Harte succeeds to the following extent:   </p>\n    <p>(1) general damages are increased to $120,000; </p>\n    <p>(2) an award of US$80,000 for ICSI procedure; </p>\n    <p>(3) an award of US$56,226 for eight courses of pre TESE-ICSI medication (three for Mr Harte and five for Mrs Harte); and </p>\n    <p>(4) the award for hormone therapy is revised to US$98,374.<br/><br/>Of course, in line with the apportionment of liability made by the judge, Dr Tan has to bear 60% of the foregoing.<br/><br/>We tabulate hereunder the total damages payable to Mr Harte, including those items not disputed in this appeal. In respect of each item Mr Harte is only entitled to 60%:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(1)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">General damages of S$120,000</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">S$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">72,000.00</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(2)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Special damages of S$4,992.70</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">S$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">2,995.62</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(3)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Special damages of US$4,982.08</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">US$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">2,989.25</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(4)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Future TESE treatment, US$30,000</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">US$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">18,000.00</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(5)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Future ICSI treatment, US$80,000</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">US$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">48,000.00</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(6)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Pre-TESE/ICSI medication, US$56,226</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">US$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">33,735.60</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(7)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Hormone replacement therapy, US$98,374</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">US$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">59,024.38</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Total</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">S$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">74,995.62</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">US$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">161,749.23</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(converted at the rate adopted by trial judge at US$1 [equals] S$1.74, this amounts to S$281,443.66)</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Grand total</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">S$</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">356,439.28</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>As ruled by the judge below, items (1) and (2) shall carry interest at 3%, and item (3) at 5%, from the date of the writ.<br/><br/><strong><i> Dr Tan`s appeal on costs </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now turn to Dr Tan`s appeal on costs. The judge made three orders on costs. First, Dr Tan was to pay Mr Harte`s costs of the action. Second, Mr Harte was to pay the costs of Gleneagles Hospital. He refused a Bullock/Sanderson order asked for by Mr Harte. Third, the judge allowed two counsel for each party and their costs to be taxed on the High Court scale, notwithstanding the total sum awarded to Mr Harte was less than $250,000.<br/><br/>Mr Harte has not appealed against the order requiring him to pay the costs of Gleneagles Hospital. However, Dr Tan contends that the order requiring him to pay the full costs of Mr Harte is wrong. This is because he had made an offer to settle under O 22A r 9(3) and Mr Harte recovered an amount very much less than the sum of $300,000 which was offered on 16 May 2000. However, in the light of our decision above in enhancing the damages payable to Mr Harte, this question has become academic. The damages we award herein to Mr Harte exceed the sum offered.<br/><br/>Before we conclude this judgment, there is another point on costs, which we need to mention. Counsel for Dr Tan argues that much time and effort were spent  on determining whether Dr Tan was negligent in carrying out the operation. He was vindicated on that. Therefore, Mr Harte should not be given the full costs of the trial. However, having regard to the complex nature of the claim, the close link between the post-operation negligence and the operation itself and the conduct of Dr Tan as alluded to by the judge below, we do not think he was wrong to have ordered full costs of the trial to Mr Harte and we are not inclined to interfere with the judge`s exercise of his discretion in the matter.<br/><br/><strong><i> Judgment </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In the result the appeal of Mr Harte is allowed to the extent as indicated above. However, as he failed on the two main issues - the question that damages should not be reduced by 40% and the claim for loss of future earnings - we would, therefore, only allow him half the costs of this appeal.

The trial judge disallowed the claim by Star City Pty Ltd (`Star City`) to recover what they alleged were unpaid loans granted to the respondent, Mr Tan Hong Woon (`Mr Tan`) for the purpose of gambling, on the basis that this was in fact a gaming contract and irrecoverable under s 5 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Ed).<br/><br/><strong><i> Background facts </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellant, Star City operates the only licenced casino under the Casino Control Act 1992 of New South Wales, Australia. This casino is known as Star City Casino and is located in the Sydney suburb of Pyrmont. In accordance with the rules of its licence, Star City Casino has to comply with strict credit controls supervised by the Casino Control Authority of Australia. All gaming transactions within the casino are done with chips, other than slot machines, keno and totalisation betting. There are basically three ways by which a patron can obtain chips for gaming in the casino. The first is by simply exchanging cash for chips at either the counters or the gambling tables; the second will be through a deposit account and the third is through the cheque cashing facility (`CCF`). A patron who has been granted a credit facility hands over a cheque to the casino in exchange for a chip purchase voucher (`CPV`) of an equivalent value. The CPV will then be exchanged for chips for gaming at the tables. If the patron does not have his personal cheques with him, he may request to make use of counter cheques, known as `house cheques`. A house cheque is simply a document printed on a format which has been pre-approved by the Casino Control Authority and is recognised by most banks in Australia. The patron after signing the house cheque hands it over to the counter staff in exchange for a CPV and consequently chips for gaming. It is also Star City`s standard practice that, before handing over the  CPV to the patron, the casino staff will inform the patron that his cheque, if drawn upon an account in Australia, will be available for redemption within 10 working days after its acceptance. The patron can redeem his cheque by exchanging it with cash, bank drafts, CPV, chips or via the electronic transfer of funds of an equivalent value. If the cheque is not redeemed within the applicable time period, Star City will then present the cheque for payment. Without the CCF, the patron will not be able to gamble at the casino unless he has enough cash in hand to pay for the gambling chips or has sufficient funds in his cash deposit account.<br/><br/>The respondent, Mr Tan, is a seasoned gambler and a regular patron of Star City Casino. Between February 1996 to March 1998, he visited and gambled at the casino on at least 28 occasions and was treated by the casino as a `valued patron`. Mr Tan was also granted the use of the casino`s CCF in February 1996. In March 1998, Star City provided Mr Tan and his wife with two complimentary air tickets to Sydney as well as a complimentary suite at their hotel for a few days. Between 26 and 28 March 1998, Mr Tan signed and handed over to Star City five house cheques, each for the sum of AU$50,000, in exchange for CPVs and promptly proceeded to lose the entire sum of AU$250,000. When these house cheques were presented to Mr Tan`s bank for payment, all five were dishonoured for lack of sufficient funds in his bank account. Subsequently Mr Tan made good to the casino AU$55,160, leaving the sum of AU$194,840 unpaid. The appellant is now seeking to recover this sum as unpaid loans made to the respondent to enable him to gamble at their casino.<br/><br/><strong><i> The decision below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In a carefully reasoned judgment, the trial judge examined the effect which s 5 of the Civil Law Act has upon gaming contracts made abroad. He was of the view that s 5(1) of the Civil Law Act which renders all contracts of gaming or wagering void, has no extra-territorial effect and thus applies only to gaming contracts concluded in Singapore. Therefore, he held that s 5(1) does not invalidate here the gaming contract which was concluded in New South Wales. However, s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act is a procedural section and applies as part of the lex fori to make unenforceable in Singapore all actions to recover `money won upon a wager`, regardless of whether or not the wager was concluded in Singapore or elsewhere and whether or not the wagering contract, if made abroad, was lawful at the place where it was made.<br/><br/>The trial judge did not accept that a claim cannot be viewed as an attempt to recover money won upon a wager merely because a cheque was exchanged for chips. Whether there is a genuine loan must depend on the circumstances in each case. He held that, when the facts in the case were examined closely, it was evident that Mr Tan gambled and lost the sum which Star City is seeking to recover from him. There was only one contract and that was a gaming contract between the parties. Therefore whether Star City`s claim was framed as a recovery of a loan, a claim on the dishonoured cheques or one for money had and received, the action would ultimately be characterised as one for money won upon a wager and was irrecoverable in the courts of Singapore.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Before us, Star City contends that the trial judge erred in the following main aspects:   </p>\n    <ul>(1) in deciding that it was open to him to `re-characterise` the moneys as `moneys won upon a wager`;</ul> <ul>(2) that s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act was procedural in nature;</ul> <ul>(3) in not allowing Star City to claim upon the dishonoured house cheques. Star City argues that when a cheque is issued as payment under a contract of sale, it is treated as a distinct and separate transaction from the underlying contract. Therefore, even if the gambling contract is unenforceable (but not void) in Singapore by virtue of s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act, the claim on the cheque is still good and enforceable.</ul><br/><br/>We are of the view that the third argument can be disposed of summarily here. It is established law that there can be no recovery on the cheque if the enforcement of the underlying contract would be against public policy or contrary to a statute that must be applied as part of the lex fori. Therefore this third argument must stand or fall together with the first and second. We shall deal with the second issue first.<br/><br/><strong><i> First issue: Section 5 Civil Law Act and the common law </i></strong><p><strong> </strong></p><p><br/><br/>It may be appropriate to set out the relevant provisions of our s 5(1) and (2) of the Civil Law Act which is in pari materia to s 18 of the Gaming Act 1845 (UK). Section 5(6) is largely similar to s 1 of the English Gaming Act of 1892. The section states as follows:  </p><blockquote><i>Agreements by way of gaming or wagering to be null and void</i></blockquote><p>  </p><blockquote><i><ul>5(1) All contracts or agreements, whether by parol or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering shall be null and void.</ul>  <ul>(2) No action shall be brought or maintained in the court for recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to be won upon any wager or which has been deposited in the hands of any person to abide the event on which any wager has been made.</ul>  <ul>(3) Subsections (1) and (2) shall not be deemed to apply to any subscription or contribution, or agreement to subscribe or contribute, for or toward any plate, prize or sum of money to be awarded to the winner or winners of any lawful game, sport, pastime or exercise.</ul></i></blockquote><p>  </p><blockquote><i>...</i></blockquote><p>  </p><blockquote><i><ul>(6) Any promise, express or implied, to pay any person any sum of money paid by him under or in respect of any contract or agreement rendered null and void by subsections (1) and (2), or to pay any sum of money by way of commission, fee, reward or otherwise in respect of any such contract or of any services in relation thereto or in connection therewith, shall be null and void, and no such action shall be brought or maintained to recover any such sum of money.</ul></i></blockquote><p><br/><br/><strong> NATURE AND EFFECT OF SECTION 5(2) CIVIL LAW ACT</strong></p><p><br/><br/>Star City argues that, as a matter of principle, notwithstanding that s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act begins with the words ` no action shall be brought`, it is a  substantive provision because it extinguishes a right of action by divesting it of its legal enforceability. They also referred us to an article `Substance and Procedure - the Gaming Acts` 23 ALJ 487 which argued that the majority decision in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hill v William Hill (Park Lane)</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1949]  AC 530</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1949] 2 All ER 452</font> in effect destroyed the basis for construing s 5(2) as procedural by assigning to it a clear and unambiguous meaning of substantive import. With respect, we disagree. In order to explain our conclusion, it will be appropriate for us to examine some judicial authorities interpreting s 5(2).<br/><br/>It was once thought that s 5(2) does not add anything more to s 5(1) and is a prime example of a parliamentary enactment saying the same thing twice over without adding anything to what has already been said. The conclusion was reached because once a contract is rendered null and void by s 5(1) there can be nothing to recover. At best, s 5(2) was considered as a section which confirms the consequences of the simple proposition in s 5(1) that all gaming or wagering contracts shall be null and void. The link equating validity and the enforceability of a contract was thus made. The conclusion required the courts in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Bubb v Yelverton</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1870]  LR 9 Eq 471</font>,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Re Browne, ex p Martingell</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1904] 2 KB 133</font>,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Chapman v Franklin</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1905] 21 TLR 515</font> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hyams v Stuart King</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1908] 2 KB 696</font> to draw a distinction between the gaming contract itself and other collateral contracts arising therefrom. These cases involved gamblers who owed debts to creditors. In order to prevent these creditors from complaining against the gambler or to embarrass him for his unpaid debts, the gambler would often hand over to the creditor some valuable security in the form of bills, notes or bonds. When the gambler defaulted upon the gambling debts, the creditor would then sue upon this new contract to pay. The courts allowed recovery upon the basis that there was a collateral contract between the creditor and debtor supported by valuable consideration when the creditor agreed not to do something to the detriment of the debtor. So while a plaintiff cannot sue for the recovery of money won by him by betting, nor on a bill, note or cheque given to pay the money lost, he can sue upon a new contract, not tainted by illegality and made for good consideration if he can prove such a contract. The words of Buckley J in <strong><i> Re Browne, ex p Martingell </i></strong> (supra) summed up the judicial thinking of the day:  </p><blockquote><i>The bills were given for an altogether new consideration, which was not an illegal consideration. They were given, not to pay the gambling debt, but, as Romilly MR said in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Bubb v Yelverton</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1870]  LR 9 Eq 471</font>, to avoid the consequences of not having paid it.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>However, the law has now changed. The appellant in <strong><i> Hill v William Hill (Park Lane) </i></strong> (supra) incurred betting debts amounting to 3,935l 12s 6d. The respondents who were bookmakers obtained a decision from the committee of Tattersalls that the appellant should pay 635l 12s 6d within 14 days and discharge the balance by monthly instalments. He failed to comply and in consideration of his giving them a cheque for the amount of 635l 12s 6d, the respondents agreed to refrain from enforcing the decision of the committee which would have involved his being posted as a defaulter and warned off the races. However, the cheque was subsequently dishonoured and the respondents brought an action to recover the sum due under the agreement. The majority of the House of Lords refused to allow the recovery of the moneys. They held that the payments contracted to be made by the agreement were in essence payments of `a sum of money alleged to be won  upon a wager` within the second limb of s 18 of the Gaming Act 1845 [our s 5(2)] and accordingly irrecoverable. Unlike s 5(1) which only renders null and void the original wagering or gaming contract, s 5(2) strikes down as unenforceable all other contracts to pay the sum won upon a wager. The prior position in <strong><i> Hyams v Stuart King </i></strong> (supra) when an artificial distinction was made between the original wagering contract and a subsequent agreement not to embarrass the gambler or to call him a defaulter was overruled. Wherever the obligation under the contract is or includes the payment of money won upon a wager, the courts will not enforce the performance of that part of the obligation. The essence of the decision in <strong><i> Hill v William Hill (Park Lane) </i></strong> was contained in the judgment of Lord Greene ([1949] AC 530 at 552-553; [1949] 2 All ER 452 at 465):  </p><blockquote><i>Here the language of the first branch [ie s 5(1)] is entirely different from the language of the second branch. Under the first branch the agreement is a nullity before the race is run. The second branch [ie s 5(2)] assumes the race to have been run and the bet to have been lost. It is true that the language of the second branch would prohibit the bringing of an action upon a wager which had been won. To that extent I agree that it covers ground already adequately covered by the first branch. But that is no justification for limiting the words of the second branch as suggested. They are quite general and when read in their ordinary meaning they extend to any action to recover money alleged to be won on a wager ... I find myself in complete agreement with what was said on this topic by Fletcher Moulton L.J. in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hyams v Stuart King</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1908] 2 KB 696</font>, 713: \"It provides with complete generality that no action shall be brought to recover anything alleged to be won upon any wager, without in any way limiting the application of the provision to the wagering contract itself.\"</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/><strong><i> Hill v William Hill (Park Lane) </i></strong> was not a case that was concerned with the nature of s 5(2) but rather the scope of its application. We are hence of the view that the issue of whether s 5(2) is a procedural section or not must be tested by the `guidelines` set down in the cases. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Monterosso Shipping Co v International Transport Workers` Federation</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1982] 3 All ER 841</font>, one of the issues that arose was the effect of one s 18 of the English Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 which declared that a collective agreement `shall be conclusively presumed not to have been <strong><i> intended by the parties to be a legally enforceable contract </i></strong> unless the agreement ... states that the parties intend that the agreement shall be a legally enforceable contract`. The Court of Appeal held that s 18 was to be classed as a substantive provision. Lord Denning MR said (at p 846):  </p><blockquote><i>It seems to me that the true distinction is between the existence of a contract (which is substantive law) and the remedies for breach of it (which is procedural law). The right course is to analyse the statute and see whether it negatives the existence of a contract or not. If there is no contract, then there is nothing to enforce. That is substantive law. If there is a contract, but the statute says it cannot be enforced ... that is procedural law. It is governed by the lex fori. In this present case, as I construe s 18 of the 1974 Act, it negatives the existence of any contract at all.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>Since s 18 makes it a conclusive presumption that there is no intention to create legal relations between the parties, which is an essential element of any contract, it is rightly construed as being a substantive provision. Words to similar effect were also used by the court in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Re Shoesmith</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1938] 2 KB 637</font> following Lush LJ in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Poyser v Minors</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1881] 7 QBD 329</font> at 333:   </p><blockquote><i>\"[P]rocedure\" ... denotes the mode of proceeding by which a legal right is enforced, as distinguished from the law which gives or defines the right, and which by means of the proceeding the Court is to administer the machinery as distinguished from its product.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>Therefore in every case, to determine whether a provision is substantive or procedural, one must look at the effect and purpose of that provision. If the provision regulates proceedings rather than affects the existence of a legal right, it is a procedural provision. A distinction is drawn between the essential validity of a right and its enforceability. Applying this to s 5(2), it is clear that the interpretation taken in <strong><i> Hill v William Hill (Park Lane) </i></strong> (supra) does not per se render it a substantive provision. Although it now renders unenforceable all actions to recover sums won upon wagers, s 5(2) does not nullify such other actions not falling within s 5(1). The crucial words in s 5(2) are `no action shall be brought`. Conversely the court in <strong><i> Hill v William Hill (Park Lane) </i></strong> was concerned with the essence of the action to recover, thus the important words were `money won upon a wager`. It is clear to us that the decision in <strong><i> Hill v William Hill (Park Lane) </i></strong> only widens the ambit of s 5(2) but not its legal nature under private international law.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the bulk of authority is that s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act is procedural. Volume 8(1) <strong><i> Halsbury`s Laws of England </i></strong> (4th Ed) (1996 Reissue) para 1081 states the position as follows:  </p><blockquote><i>In so far as the Gaming Act 1845 [our s 5 Civil Law Act] enacts that no suit is to be brought or maintained to recover any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to have been won upon any wager, it is a statute affecting <strong> procedure</strong>, and therefore no action lies in England for money won upon a wager in a foreign country, even though the wager is lawful by its proper law. [Emphasis is added.]</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>Dicey and Morris <strong><i> Conflict of Laws </i></strong> also states in similar terms at para 33-436:  </p><blockquote><i>Section 18 of the Gaming Act 1845 makes wagering contracts null and void. It also forbids suits being brought to recover money won on wagers. It is therefore a statute which deals both with the validity and with the enforceability of such contracts. The validity of a foreign wagering contract is not affected by this statute, but though valid, it cannot be sued upon in an English court. Being part of the <strong> lex fori</strong>, the second <strong> procedural</strong> part of the section relieves the court of the duty of adjudicating on foreign wagering contracts which by the ordinary rules of private international law would escape validation by the first part.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>Therefore the better and more widely supported view is that s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act is procedural and the appellant`s contention on this issue must be rejected. The consequence of reaching the conclusion that s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act is procedural means that our courts must apply it as part of the lex fori; <strong><i> lex fori ad litis ordinationa </i></strong>. Applying this to our facts, Star City`s claim, though originating from New South Wales, therefore becomes subject to s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act and is unenforceable in Singapore if it is `an action for recovering any sum won upon a wager`.<br/><br/><strong><i> Second issue: Does Star City`s claim fall within section 5(2) Civil Law Act? </i></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><br/><br/><strong><i> wagering contract </i></strong><strong><i> action on the loan </i></strong>The trilogy of cases,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Quarrier v Colston</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1842] 1 Ph 147</font>(Unreported) ,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Saxby v Fulton</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1909] 2 KB 208</font> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Soci,t, Anonyme des Grands Establissements de  Touquet Paris-Plage v Baumgart</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1927] 96 LJKB 789</font>(Unreported)  all stand for the proposition that an action on the loan itself will succeed if the loan is valid by its governing law. This is in contradistinction to the other principle contained within s 5 of the Civil Law Act that a wagering contract which is valid by its governing law is valid in Singapore, but no action lies in Singapore to recover any sum of money won on such a contract. It is clear that recovery turns upon the characterisation of the transaction in question. If there is a loan, the first line of authorities applies whereas, if there is an action to recover money won upon a wagering contract, s 5 of the Civil Law Act prevails. This is reflected in r 199 <strong><i> Dicey and Morris </i></strong> as follows:   </p><ul>(1) A  which is valid by its governing law is valid in England, but no action lies in England to recover any money won on such a contract.</ul> <ul>(2) A cheque drawn on an English bank and given by way of security for money won by gaming or betting on games, or for money lent for gaming or betting, is deemed to have been given for an illegal consideration. Hence an action in England on the cheque will fail, unless it has been negotiated to a holder in due course.</ul> <ul>(3) But an  itself will succeed if the loan is valid by its governing law.</ul><br/><br/>The authors then go on to state the three principles flowing forthwith from r 199:   <ul>(1) An English statute which makes wagering contracts void applies only to contracts governed by English law.</ul> <ul>(2) An English statute which makes wagering contracts unenforceable, ie forbids the bringing of an action on the contract, applies to all actions brought in an English court on wagering contracts, irrespective of the law applicable to them.</ul> <ul>(3) English law governs the validity of a negotiable instrument, eg a cheque payable in England but issued or negotiated by way of conditional payment of, or security for, a debt arising from a foreign wagering contract.</ul><br/><br/>We agree with the trial judge that the proper law of the gaming contract and transaction relating to Mr Tan`s utilisation of the CCF is the law of New South Wales. It was an express term of the CCF application form that the agreement between the parties was to be governed by the laws of New South Wales. New South Wales was also where the gambling took place and where the loan facility for placing the wager was offered and accepted. Star City argues that, having selected New South Wales as the proper law of the contract, Mr Tan`s liability must be determined according to its laws. Since under New South Wales laws, a loan of AU$194,840 for the purpose of gambling had been advanced by Star City to Mr Tan, this sum of money should be recoverable as a loan in Singapore. Therefore the trial judge erred in deciding that it was open to the courts of the forum to `re-characterise` the moneys as `moneys won upon a wager`.<br/><br/>We are of the view that while the conflict rules assist the court in determining the appropriate choice of laws, they do not go further. One is still left with the fundamental question of whether the courts of the forum are entitled to re-characterise a foreign transaction when applying a procedural statutory provision  of the lex fori even before applying choice of law rules. We shall now examine some case authorities to determine the course which this court should adopt.<br/><br/><strong> RELEVANT CASE AUTHORITIES</strong><p><br/><br/>The case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>G &amp; H Montage GmbH v Irvani</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1990] 2 All ER 225</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1990] 1 WLR 667</font> is instructive although it deals with a different subject matter. The plaintiffs, a West German company drew up 30 bills of exchange naming them as drawers and IDS, an Iranian company as drawees. They were expressed to be paid to the plaintiffs` order in London. The bills were then indorsed and signed by the defendant, the chairman of IDS in Iran. The plaintiffs, as drawers then signed and sent the bills to their bank. The words `bon pour aval pour les tires` (good as a guarantee for the drawees) were then added by the defendant to the bills. The bills were subsequently dishonoured; however, no notice of dishonour or protest was given or made by the plaintiffs in respect of the bills. The plaintiffs then sued the defendant on the aval for the sums due in England. Under the Geneva Conventions on Bills of Exchange of 1932, an aval acts like an indemnity whereby the giver of the aval is bound to make good the whole or part of the amount of the bill in the same manner as the person for whom he has become guarantor. Both parties agree that the choice of law governing the bills of exchange was to be determined by reference to s 72 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 (UK) as the lex fori. The issue relevant for our purposes is whether the procedural requirements of protest and notice of dishonour in s 72(3) applied to a claim on an aval. Section 72 reads:  </p><blockquote><i>Where a bill drawn in one country is ... accepted, or payable in another, the rights, duties, and liabilities of the parties thereto are determined as follows ...</i></blockquote><p>  </p><blockquote><i><ul>(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the interpretation of the ... indorsement ... is determined by the law of the place where such contract is made.</ul>  <ul>(3) The duties of the holder with respect to ... the necessity for or sufficiency of a protest [<strong><i> s 51 </i></strong>] or notice of dishonour [<strong><i> s 48 </i></strong>], or otherwise, are determined by the law of the place where the act is done or the bill is dishonoured. [Emphasis is added.]</ul></i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>Saville J held at first instance [1988] 1 WLR 1285 and affirmed by the Court of Appeal that, in accordance with s 72(2), the proper law governing the interpretation of the indorsement of the bills of exchange was German law. Therefore upon the basis of that interpretation and applying German law, the court accepted that the obligations of the defendant were to be categorised as those of a bill of exchange guarantor and not those of an indorser. The court also found that in principle s 72(3), as part of the lex fori, applied to the foreign bills of exchange as all that was required to bring the section into play was that the holder of the bill should bring a claim upon it, even though the claim was of a kind which English law did not acknowledge. The reasoning by the Court of Appeal suggests that, once it has been found that German law characterises the action as one upon the aval, it is no longer open to the forum when applying a procedural provision to re-characterise the action as something else. The lex fori is to be applied upon that foreign cause of action as it is, even though it does not exist in the forum. This is most explicit from the judgment of Woolf LJ ([1990] 2 All ER 225 at 241-242; [1990] 1 WLR 667 at 687):  </p><blockquote><i>Having so categorised the defendant`s liability [as that of a giver of an aval under German law as the place where the contract was made], the next stage is to apply s 72(3)  of the 1882 Act ... The result of applying s 72(3) is that it is the requirements of English law which have to be complied with as to the giving of notice of dishonour and the noting of protest. <strong> The application of English law does not, however, necessitate the recategorisation of the defendant`s liability which both under German law and Iranian law is that of a giver of an aval</strong>. [Emphasis is added.]</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>Purchas LJ ([1990] 2 All ER 225 at 242-243; [1990] 1 WLR 667 at 688) also commented in a similar fashion:  </p><blockquote><i>Subsection (3) ... is concerned with the procedure to be adopted by a holder of the bill when presenting it for acceptance or, as in this case, for payment if the bill is dishonoured. In relation to the necessity for, or sufficiency of, a protest or notice of dishonour or otherwise this shall be determined by the law of the place where the act is done or the bill is dishonoured [lex fori]. So the procedure to be adopted when unsuccessfully presenting the bill for payment is to be determined by the law of the place where that act is to be done but <strong> this does not have relevance to the interpretation of liabilities arising under the supervening contracts related to the bill</strong>. [Emphasis is added.]</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>A similar approach was implicitly taken in <strong><i> Soci,t, Anonyme des Grands Establissements de Touquet Paris-Plage v Baumgart </i></strong> (supra). The defendant drew three cheques on an English bank in favour of the plaintiffs who were the proprietors of a casino at Le Touquet. The cheques were exchanged for francs in cash for gambling. The cheques were dishonoured and the plaintiffs sued upon them or alternatively for money spent. Sherman J was satisfied on the evidence of a French avocat that the games were lawful in France, an action for money lent for the purpose of gaming at those games can be brought in the French courts and that money so lent can be sued for in France either on any security given or on the <strong><i> loan </i></strong> itself instead of the security. Without going further to re-characterise the nature of the transaction under English law, the judge went on to allow the recovery of the moneys on the basis that they were moneys lent abroad where gaming was lawful and recoverable.<br/><br/>Conversely, there was some indication in <strong><i> Quarrier v Colston </i></strong> and <strong><i> Saxby v Fulton </i></strong> (supra) that it was English law as the lex fori that determined the nature of the transaction. The facts in both cases were largely similar. Two friends were in the habit of going for holidays together. One would lend money to the other; a large part of which was used for gambling although not all. This was known to both parties. The debtor died and the creditor sued his estate for the moneys that had been advanced. The claims were resisted by the personal representatives on the basis this was an action for the payment of money lost at play. Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst in <strong><i> Quarrier v Colston </i></strong>, on the basis that an IOU was given by the testator to the plaintiff, held that there was a loan for the purpose of gambling which can be recovered so long as the gaming took place in a country where they were not illegal. There is suggestion that English law as the lex fori was applied, the Lord Chancellor referring several times to `the memorandum as prima facie evidence of the debt`. Similarly in <strong><i> Saxby v Fulton </i></strong>, Vaughan-Williams J felt that he was obliged by the English authority of <strong><i> Quarrier v Colston </i></strong> to hold that there was a loan and the loan being made for legal gambling abroad was enforceable in England.<br/><br/><strong> THE LOCAL APPROACH</strong></p><p><br/><br/>The approach of the local courts towards re-characterisation should also be examined. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Las Vegas Hilton Corp v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1997:1:341:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1997:1:341:\">  [1997] 1 SLR 341 </a>, the plaintiff casino commenced an action against the defendant for the recovery of approximately US$1.6m. The money was lent in this way: the defendant completed a casino credit card, approval for the amount of credit was obtained and he could then draw on the credit to gamble. Each time he drew on the credit, he had to sign a marker for the relevant amount before the equivalent amount of gaming chips would be given to him in exchange. According to expert opinion in that case, the gaming on credit under Nevada law was legal and each marker executed by the defendant evidenced a loan and constituted a debt owed by the defendant to the casino enforceable under that law. This was accepted by the High Court. The judge held that the fact that the loan, if governed by Singapore law could be invalid and void under s 5 of the Civil Law Act did not mean that it, being governed by Nevada law and valid under that law, may not be enforced in Singapore. In other words, having accepted that the credit facility extended by the casino was enforceable and valid as a loan in Nevada, it fell outside the scope of s 5(2) altogether. However, we note that the court in that case was only concerned with the issue of enforceability of the loan. It was not disputed by both parties that a loan had been advanced by the casino to the gambler. Therefore no arguments were raised and the court was not required to consider the issue which faces us here: whether it is entitled to re-look or re-characterise the nature of the transaction when applying s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act as the lex fori.<br/><br/>The next case was  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Loh Chee Song v Liew Yong Chian</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1998:2:641:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1998:2:641:\">  [1998] 2 SLR 641 </a>. The plaintiff junket`s claim against the defendant gambler was on three dishonoured cheques totalling $150,000. The defendant had obtained advances from the plaintiff for the purchase of rolling chips. The gambling was on board a ship in international waters, but there was no evidence as to which flag the vessel was flying. In the absence of such evidence, the judge held that it was for the court to determine the proper law of the contract. This was Singapore law as this was the jurisdiction that was closest and most convenient for the parties. Both were Singaporeans, the vessels were berthed in Singapore and returned to Singapore after each cruise. Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck held that a loan had been advanced by the plaintiff to the defendant for the purposes of gambling. He further held that the loan was recoverable, as it was not against public interest to allow recovery of such loans. Section 5 of the Civil Law Act did not nullify loans made for the purposes of gaming or wagering. It only nullified any gaming or wagering contract and any prize won could not be recovered with the assistance of the court. In the words of Choo JC (at [para ]6):  </p><blockquote><i>The two [a loan and a wagering contract] are distinct transactions. If A lends money to B who used it to lay a wager with C, the contract between B and C is affected by s 6 [now s 5] but not the contract between A and B.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>It seems clear that Choo JC applied Singapore law as the proper law of the contract to make an initial characterisation of the transaction as a loan and having done so, held that it fell outside the reach of s 5 of the Civil Law Act. However, the case  was similarly equivocal as to the essential issue in this present case as no foreign elements were involved.<br/><br/>We now move on to consider the recent authority of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Star Cruise Services v Overseas Union Bank</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1999:3:412:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1999:3:412:\">  [1999] 3 SLR 412 </a>. The <strong><i> Star Cruise </i></strong> case involved a cheque cashing facility similar to that used by Star City. The gambler gives a cashiers` order or cheque to the casino in exchange for credit equivalent to the value of the cashiers` order or cheque. If the gambler wins, the cheque is returned to him when accounts are settled. If the gambler loses, the casino retains the cheque and realises it to make good his loss. The judge looked at the final effect of the transaction and held it abundantly clear that the cheque or cashiers` order represented the losses or winnings of the gambler. When the play was over and accounts were settled, the moneys that were paid over or retained would be moneys won by way of gaming; nothing more or nothing less. Therefore, although the casinos called it a loan it was actually a gambling debt, the recovery of which was prohibited by s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act. In the words of GP Selvam J (as he then was) (at [para ]69):  </p><blockquote><i>[W]hen faced with a gaming transaction, having regard to s 9A of the Interpretation Act, one must take the scene in its totality and determine what the true nature of the contract is and give effect to s 6 [now our s 5] to promote its purpose and object.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>Further in <strong><i> Star Cruise </i></strong> (supra), GP Selvam J also held that it was the law of the forum that decides what actions may be brought and what actions may not be brought. If the domestic law says actions of a certain kind cannot be brought it means that the court cannot adjudicate them irrespective of where the cause of action arose. In his view, the courts of the forum were fully justified in applying the lex fori to discover the reality of the gambling transaction before deciding whether an action to recover the moneys can be enforced in Singapore. He emphasised this at [para ]87 of the judgment:  </p><blockquote><i>The clear and peremptory wording of s 6(1), (2) and (5) [our s 5(1), (2) and (6)] means that parties cannot contract out of its provisions either expressly or impliedly by choosing some other system of law because those provisions are based on public policy and the parties will not be permitted by agreement to override them.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>Similar statements were made by the judge in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Sun Cruises v Overseas Union Bank</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1999:3:404:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1999:3:404:\">  [1999] 3 SLR 404 </a> and <strong><i> Quek Chiau Beng v Phua Swee Pah Jimmy </i></strong> (DC 500072/99, RA 6000539/2000).<br/><br/>We are aware that in both <strong><i> Star Cruise </i></strong> and <strong><i> Sun Cruises </i></strong> (supra), the proper law of the contract and the lex fori was Singapore law. The coincidence of laws may make it difficult to conclude that the case is authority for the proposition that the lex fori should be used when applying s 5(2) to re-characterise the transaction as one that is substantially different from that under its proper foreign law. Be that as it may, we read GP Selvam J to be clearly of the view that forum public policy calls for the Singapore courts, when applying s 5(2), to pierce the veil to discover the reality of the transaction.<br/><br/><strong> PRINCIPLE AND PUBLIC POLICY</strong></p><p><br/><br/>As examined above, the cases as a whole do not clearly reveal the characterisation process of the courts when applying the procedural laws of the  forum. The issue must ultimately depend upon the public policy of Singapore: whether our courts should help in the enforcement of gambling contracts technically falling outside local statutory prohibitions, but with potentially deleterious effects on the social and economic fabric of our society.<br/><br/>To begin with, it is clear that the enforcement of a right or a cause of action is a matter for the forum. The lex fori does not interfere in the validity of the transaction but as the place where the action is being brought, it has the right to determine the situations when foreign causes of action can be enforced. It is an established principle of private international law that the courts of the forum will not enforce a foreign cause of action that is contrary to local public policy. We need only refer to <strong><i> Dicey and Morris </i></strong> (13th Ed) at p 81:  </p><blockquote><i>Rule 2 - English courts will not enforce or recognise a right, power, capacity, disability, or legal relationship arising under the law of a foreign country, if the enforcement or recognition of such right, power, capacity, disability or legal relationship would be inconsistent with the fundamental public policy of English law.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>This was also echoed by Turner J in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hope v Hope</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1857] 8 De GM &amp; G 731</font>(Unreported) :  </p><blockquote><i>I think that, when the courts of one country are called upon to enforce contracts entered into in another country, the question to be considered is not merely whether the contract sought to be enforced is valid according to the laws of the country in which it was entered into, but whether it is consistent with the laws and policy of the country in which it is sought to be enforced. A contract may be good by the law of another country, but if it be in breach, fraud, or evasion of the law of this country, or contrary to its policy, the Courts of this country cannot, as I conceive, be called upon to enforce it.</i></blockquote><p><br/><br/>We are of the view that in order to determine whether the enforcement of a foreign cause of action would be contrary to forum policy, the court must necessarily apply its mind and the lex fori to determine its true substance. Otherwise, the forum would no longer be master of its own home and local public policy concerns easily circumvented by `forum-shopping`. There is another way to support this conclusion. We have earlier concluded that s 5(2) is a procedural provision which applies whenever foreign causes of action are being enforced in Singapore. The clear and peremptory words of s 5 of the Civil Law Act make clear that it is intended by the legislature to be a forum mandatory provision which parties cannot avoid by contracting out of. Our courts must hence pay attention to the essence of foreign transactions and must forcefully resist all attempts to evade the provisions of the Civil Law Act. We are further supported in our conclusion by s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1999 Ed) which requires the court, in the interpretation of a statutory provision, to prefer a purposive interpretation which would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object. Putting the two principles together, it follows that the courts of the forum are entitled to re-characterise a transaction according to the law and logic of the lex fori. Unlike what Star City contends, we consider that the trial judge was, in principle, fully justified to look into the reality of the transaction so as to determine whether s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act applied. The fact that a sum of money won on a wagering contract is valid and enforceable under the laws of New South Wales should not prevent the Singapore courts from  declining to aid in its enforcement, if to do so would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore.<br/><br/>What then is this aspect of local public policy that militates against the recovery of moneys won in foreign wagering contracts which are valid and enforceable overseas? It is clear that gaming and wagering contracts were never considered to be illegal in common law. The distinction which the law makes between wagering contracts and others is therefore entirely the creation of statute. In line with the position in England, the Singapore legislature has long departed from the historical position that gambling and gaming, especially when on credit, is a social vice that has to be eradicated at all costs. It now recognises that gambling can be permitted for its entertainment value if it is strictly controlled and regulated by the relevant authorities. Gambling per se is no longer considered to be contrary to the public interest and this accounts for the various forms of legalised gaming and gambling which currently exists in Singapore such as 4-D, Toto, the Big Sweep, the Singapore Turf Club, etc. Therefore there is no general principle of public policy in Singapore, against the recovery of money lent for the purposes of gambling abroad, so long if the transaction is indeed a genuine loan and one which is valid and enforceable according to that foreign law.<br/><br/>However, what is objectionable is courts being used by casinos to enforce gambling debts disguised in the `form` of loans. Valuable court time and resources that can be better used elsewhere are wasted on the recovery of such unmeritorious claims. The machinery of the courts cannot be used indirectly to legitimise the recovery of moneys won upon wagers overseas when similar relief would be refused for moneys won upon wagers in Singapore. Hence in order to give full effect to s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act, which provides that no action can be brought or maintained to enforce gambling debts, the courts of the forum cannot be prevented by foreign law from investigating into the true nature of the transaction. The courts of justice must remain out of bounds to claims for moneys won upon wagers, however cleverly or covertly disguised: <strong><i> Star Cruise Services v Overseas Union Bank </i></strong> (supra). It is in this sense that the earlier decision in <strong><i> Las Vegas Hilton Corp v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny </i></strong> (supra) can be distinguished; having felt that there is no public policy against gambling per se, the court naturally did not go further to re-characterise the transaction. However, once it is recognised that the courts should not, as a matter of principle and public policy, act as gambling debt collectors for foreign casinos, we are then obliged to investigate further according to the lex fori.<br/><br/>Although this can have the unhappy consequence that Singapore may be viewed by foreign casino operators as `safe havens` for gamblers with assets situated here, the fact remains that gambling debts are debts of honour and not legal debts recoverable in the courts. We consider that these are the risks and consequences that casinos in the conduct of their ordinary businesses have to bear. It is but a small price to pay in exchange for the huge profits that such businesses reap by trading in games of chance. If a result of this case is that `credit` facilities will be less readily granted to local gamblers, so be it. The courts will not be concerned with such considerations but must stand guided by the principle that the courts of justice must remain out of bounds to claims based on gaming debts. We emphasise that our conclusion on the operation of s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act  merely negatives the enforcement but not the validity of gaming contracts; the casinos can always attempt to enforce their causes of action elsewhere.<br/><br/><strong> WHAT IS STAR CITY ATTEMPTING TO RECOVER?</strong></p><p><br/><br/>Having reached the two conclusions above that, first, s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act is a procedural provision which applies to all causes of action enforced in Singapore irrespective of where the gambling transactions took place and second, our courts are entitled to look beyond the foreign characterisation of the transaction to determine its true nature as a matter of principle and policy, it now remains for us to determine whether Star City is claiming from Mr Tan moneys won in wagers within the meaning of s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act.<br/><br/>Star City relies upon its undertaking to all patrons not to present the cheques for ten days pending redemption of the cheque to show that there was a promise by the patron to the casino to pay sometime in the future, ie a credit or loan transaction. The casino also argues that the issue of the cheques by Mr Tan at a time when he had `no expectation of sufficient funds in his account` in exchange for chips also meant that a loan had been advanced to him by the casino. Lastly Star City says that the trial judge erred in applying  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Cumming v Mackie</strong></font> (Unreported) (Unreported) ,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Crockfords Club v Mehta</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1992] 2 All ER 748</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1992] 1 WLR 355</font>,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>CHT v Ward</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1965] 2 QB 63</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1963] 3 All ER 835</font>,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Law v Dearnley</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1950] 1 KB 400</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1950] 1 All ER 124</font>,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Woolf v Freeman</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1937] 1 All ER 178</font> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>MacDonald v Green</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1951] 1 KB 594</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1950] 2 All ER 1240</font> because no element of private international law was involved in any of those cases. With respect to this last point, having already expressed our view that the lex fori should be used to determine the true quality of the contract between Star City and Mr Tan, it necessarily follows that we believe the trial judge to be perfectly correct in relying upon those cases to ascertain the nature of the transaction in issue.<br/><br/>We now turn to consider the nature of the transaction. Several features of the cheque-cashing facility that had been offered by Star City to Mr Tan should be noted:   </p><ul>(1) The chips are worthless outside the casino and are mere counters.</ul> <ul>(2) No moneys were ever actually advanced by the casino. Star City only gave the gambler the right to play at the tables upon presentation of the house cheques.</ul> <ul>(3) Any moneys that were lost were made good by the gambler and not Star City.</ul><br/><br/>Chips are regarded as cash in Star City casino and have to be used to gamble at the tables. Therefore a gambler patron has to exchange cash or money`s worth for the chips. We are of the view that the chips placed on the gaming tables represent the moneys paid in advance by the gamblers to the casino by the cheques, although the actual transfer of funds will come later. Therefore the chips lost at the tables represented the gambling losses of the patron. He will have to make good his gambling losses to the casino and not to anyone else. Although cheques are to remain uncashed and can be redeemed upon `re-payment` by gamblers within a period of ten days, this is only a deferred form of payment to give gamblers time to ensure that they have sufficient funds to repay their gambling losses in their bank accounts. The CCF facility provided by Star City to  their patrons cannot be genuine loans because the facility merely enables them to gamble on credit and not for any other purpose.<br/><br/>The converse conclusion will mean having to classify the exchange of the cheque for the chips as a sale; for which the casino is giving loan credit on the security of the cheque pending redemption and the gambling at the tables as a transaction that is independent and unconnected to the first. This is against logic and principle: what would a gambler want with the chips except to use them for gambling and gambling alone? A broad view of things must be taken, and this points towards the cheques being used to pay for the gaming chips and any money to be recovered by the casinos as money won/lost upon a wager rather than a true loan:  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1991] 2 AC 548</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1992] 4 All ER 512</font>. The exchange of a cheque for a CPV and chips is an essential part of the composite gambling contract. It is the means by which gambling is to take place rather than a true security for credit; a `play now and pay later` scheme. For the above reasons, we agree with the trial judge that the sum of AU$194,840 was money that Star City had won from Mr Tan on a wagering contract rather than a genuine loan.<br/><br/>Another subsidiary point was taken by Star City. It was this: Star City claimed that Mr Tan had admitted that the casino had extended a loan for the purposes of gambling to him. In addition, his subsequent conduct of repaying part of the total sum owing clearly indicated his acknowledgement of the existence of such a debt. The facts in this case were therefore indistinguishable from that of <strong><i> Las Vegas Hilton Corp v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny </i></strong> (supra) where the High Court allowed the recovery of the moneys on the basis that it was a genuine loan. We consider that there is no rational reason for differentiating between cases where there is an explicit admission of a loan by the gambler and where there is not. The fact that the gambler has stated that he believes that he owes the casino moneys lent to him for the purposes of gambling cannot convert what is essentially money lost in wagers into something else. The overriding test must be the essence of the transaction itself as determined by the courts of the forum. In addition, it is also obvious from the trial judge`s grounds of decision that he had found as a fact that Mr Tan`s position throughout the trial was that he had never obtained a loan from Star City.<br/><br/><strong><i> Conclusion </i></strong><p><strong> </strong></p><p><br/><br/>In the premises, we agree with the trial judge that s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act is a procedural section which was legislated to relieve our courts from the burden of adjudicating upon both local and foreign gambling contracts. Star City`s claim against Mr Tan being in essence an action to recover money lost upon a wager falls within s 5(2) and is unenforceable in Singapore.

The number of appeals is due to the fact that there are three main parties as well as the fact that there are appeals against the trial judge\u2019s orders as to costs. However, that having been said, the basic facts are common to all these appeals and are (more importantly) relatively straightforward as well. It would in fact be appropriate at this juncture to set out, in as succinct a manner as possible, the factual matrix, legal issues in the High Court, as well as the learned trial judge\u2019s decision. We will then proceed to set out the issues that arise in <span lang=\"EN-GB\">the present appeals before, of course, dealing with them accordingly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, it ought to be noted that counsel for the parties in the present appeal focused on only a few of the more significant issues. This is not surprising as the learned trial judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) dealt with the various issues raised at first instance in an extremely comprehensive fashion (see, especially, <i>Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] 4 SLR 417</nobr>, which is the main judgment, and <i>Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2006] SGHC 20</nobr>, which deals solely with the issue of costs). In fact, and as we shall elaborate upon below, the comprehensiveness just mentioned is accompanied by ample clarity as well as legal justification with regard to virtually all the legal issues raised. To this end, therefore, we will focus, in the main, on those issues which counsel for the parties themselves focused upon during the present appeals. To be sure, we will also cover the remaining issues but will not seek to re-traverse ground already well-covered by the Judge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The factual matrix is, as already mentioned, a relatively straightforward one, as follows.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The present proceedings arise out of the two decisions referred to at [2] above, and which we shall hereafter refer to as \u201cthe original action\u201d (with the judgments at <nobr>[2005] 4 SLR 417</nobr> and <nobr>[2006] SGHC 20</nobr> being referred to as \u201cGD\u201d and \u201cthe costs judgment\u201d, respectively). The original action involved three main interest groups: the four plaintiffs, the first defendant (\u201cCameron\u201d) and the second defendant (\u201cStork\u201d). Each group has appealed against both of the Judge\u2019s decisions, leading to the total of six appeals mentioned at the outset of this judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The dispute arose from the fracture of a slip joint (\u201cthe Failed Slip Joint\u201d) on board an oil-rig, the <i>Energy Searcher</i> (\u201cthe Vessel\u201d), on or about 16\u00a0March 2001. Slip joints (also known as telescoping joints) form part of a vessel\u2019s drilling equipment, and are used to accommodate changes in distance between the drill ship and the seabed caused by tides or ship movement. The upper end of the slip joint is connected to the vessel in question by a riser box, which is a critical load-bearing component in the drilling unit. In the present case, the Failed Slip Joint had an RCK-type riser box (\u201cthe Riser Box\u201d). On the relevant date, in the course of being installed on the Vessel, the Failed Slip Joint fractured at the end connector of the Riser Box, about 19 inches from the box face. As a result of this, the components of the drilling unit attached to the lower half of the Riser Box dropped to the bottom of the ocean. A large part of the equipment still remains unfound. Subsequent investigation revealed that the wall of the Riser Box had been over-machined, leading to excessive thinness and inability to support the weight of the drilling unit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to these events, the plaintiffs commenced the original action against both defendants. The four plaintiffs were as follows: (a)\u00a0Jet Holding Ltd (\u201cJHL\u201d), the owner of the Vessel on the relevant date; (b)\u00a0Jet Shipping Ltd (\u201cJSL\u201d), the former owner of the Vessel and the bareboat charterer of the Vessel on the relevant date; (c)\u00a0Jet Drilling (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cJDL\u201d), the manager of the Vessel; and (d)\u00a0Maurel Et Prom (\u201cMEP\u201d), the alleged assignee of the respective rights, title and interest of the other three plaintiffs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to the events in question, there were originally two slip joints on the Vessel, which were respectively given the subsea numbers 501 and 502. Upon finding that both joints were unfit for use, JDL contracted with Cameron on behalf of JSL, the owner of the Vessel at that time, to refurbish and repair them. The works were then subcontracted to Van Der Horst Engineering Services Pte Ltd (\u201cVDH\u201d). Using selected components from both joints, VDH re-assembled a single operational joint. This refurbished joint was given the subsea number 502 and was used as the primary slip joint on board the Vessel (\u201cthe Primary Slip Joint\u201d). Cameron then subcontracted the refurbishment of the unused parts of the two original joints to Stork (\u201cthe refurbishment contract\u201d). Stork was told to create a new slip joint (\u201cthe Standby Slip Joint\u201d). VDH then sent the discarded parts to Stork, which then used the parts to fabricate the Standby Slip Joint. This joint was allocated the subsea number 503.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the original action, the plaintiffs alleged that the Failed Slip Joint was one and the same as the Standby Slip Joint and sought, <i>inter alia</i>, damages for breach of contract against Cameron and damages for negligent breach of duty against both Cameron and Stork. Cameron denied all liability, and additionally commenced third party proceedings against Stork for any damages it might be ordered to pay. The plaintiffs initially alleged that the Standby Slip Joint had remained on board the Vessel from 1998, the time it was refurbished by Stork, until it fractured on the relevant date in 2001. However, Cameron subsequently adduced documents indicating that the Standby Slip Joint had been onshore in Malaysia sometime in 1999. In the face of these documents, the plaintiffs conceded during their closing submissions that the Standby Slip Joint had indeed been in Malaysia, allegedly for storage purposes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the conclusion of the trial of the original action, the Judge found that the Failed Slip Joint was indeed the Standby Slip Joint that the defendants had refurbished:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">at [42]. She held that Cameron was guilty of breaching its contract with JSL, and that both the defendants had breached their duty of care to JHL and JSL by failing to detect and remedy the defect in the Standby Slip Joint:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">at [110] and [130]. As regards JDL and MEP, the Judge held that they had no <i>locus standi</i> to bring the claims in either tort or contract, and were therefore not entitled to any damages:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[52] and [69].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of Stork\u2019s tasks as part of the refurbishment job was to dismantle and inspect the discarded parts received from VDH (\u201cthe pre-inspection\u201d).</span><a id=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 1]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Judge held that Stork had acted negligently by failing to <i>detect and remedy</i> the non-conforming \u201cstep\u201d in the Riser Box either during the pre-inspection, in the course of refurbishment or before the Riser Box left its premises:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[131]. The evidence at trial showed that Rajamanickam Prabhuram (\u201cPrabhuram\u201d), Stork\u2019s quality control inspector at the relevant time, had \u201cchosen to act in a way in which a reasonable man would not act\u201d:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[130]. According to Prabhuram, although he knew that a dimensional inspection was required from Stork\u2019s quotation No\u00a0QT2279-GA.R1 dated 25\u00a0August 1998 (\u201cthe Quotation\u201d)</span><a id=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 2]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">to Cameron, he did not think it a standard or common practice to conduct wall thickness tests on the Riser Box:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[88].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the trial, Stork placed great reliance upon the fact that Cameron failed to furnish Stork with the relevant dimensional drawings:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[98]. According to Stork, this made it impossible for Stork to ascertain the existence of any dimensional defects in the Riser Box wall. The Judge held that these omissions on Cameron\u2019s part did not detract from Stork\u2019s liability for breaching its duty of care to JHL and JSL:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[130]. In the absence of the dimensional drawings, Stork should not have gone ahead with the pre-inspection:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[130].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the issue of causation, the Judge rejected Cameron\u2019s allegation that the failure by JHL and JSL to maintain and inspect the Standby Slip Joint amounted to a <i>novus actus interveniens</i>:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[127]. She</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">also found the defence of contributory negligence inapplicable. Due to the separate and independent nature of Cameron\u2019s and Stork\u2019s breach of duty, the Judge held that they were concurrent tortfeasors and therefore <i>severally</i> liable to JHL and JSL for the <i>full</i> extent of their loss:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[164]. As the defendants were additionally found to be equally culpable, the Judge ordered Stork to indemnify Cameron for 50% of the total damages. We pause here to observe that the word \u201cindemnify\u201d is used in a <i>broad</i></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">sense. This is an important point to which we shall have occasion to return (see below at [119]\u2013[123]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having found the defendants liable to JHL and JSL, a crucial factor that affected the award of damages was whether the documents proving loss were properly admitted into evidence. The bulk of these documents had been discovered via the plaintiffs\u2019 second and third supplemental lists of documents; some were also contained in the (first) list of documents. These documents, which allegedly proved the quantum of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss, were subsequently consolidated into 12 volumes (\u201cthe Damages Bundle\u201d) for the purposes of the trial. The other documents which did not relate to the question of damages were compiled in the plaintiffs\u2019 bundle of documents.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The documents in the supplemental lists were used as evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss arising from the defendants\u2019 breach of duty, and were adduced at trial via the Damages Bundle. In addition, almost all these documents relating to quantum of damages were also referred to in Helmut van Roijen\u2019s affidavit.</span><a id=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 3]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Helmut van Roijen (\u201cHR\u201d) was the operations manager in charge of the Vessel and a key witness for the plaintiffs. As the plaintiffs had initially omitted to exhibit any of the documents referred to in HR\u2019s affidavit, they were granted leave by the Judge to rectify this defect by adducing a supplemental affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cSAEIC\u201d) to introduce the relevant documents.</span><a id=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 4]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge found that the documents in the Damages Bundle had not been properly admitted in evidence because the plaintiffs failed on at least two counts: (a)\u00a0to adduce primary evidence of the documents or prove that the exceptions for adducing secondary evidence applied; and (b)\u00a0to prove the truth of the contents of these documents through admissible evidence that was not hearsay:</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">see GD at</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[146] and [149]. Accordingly, she refused to consider any part of the Damages Bundle when assessing the extent of loss caused by Cameron\u2019s breaches. As a result, the Judge found that the JSL and JHL had not proved their claims other than for the lost Blow Out Preventor (\u201cBOP\u201d) stack, and consequently, awarded them nominal damages for those other alleged losses. The plaintiffs were awarded damages in the amount of US$1m for the loss of the BOP stack, and the further sum of $10 as nominal damages in respect of the other pleaded heads of damage. This was a far cry from the composite sum of US$22m (approximately) that the plaintiffs claimed</span><a id=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 5]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">for heads of damage such as the value of lost or damaged equipment, the loss of future income, costs of hiring and refurbishing substitute equipment and costs of the settlement agreement that had to be made with Cairn Energy India Pty Limited, who had hired the Vessel under a time charter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Looked at in the round, there were two broad categories of legal issues which arose for decision by the Judge in so far as the <i>substantive</i> issues were concerned. The first related to the issue of liability and the second related to the requisite remedies (principally, the quantum of damages that ought to be awarded), assuming that liability had been established. The focus of the present appeal has been on the <i>latter</i> as opposed to the former. Further, the specific focus in so far as the latter (<i>viz</i>, the sphere of remedies) is concerned has been largely <i>evidential</i> in nature.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should, however, mention that there is, in <i>addition to</i> the issues relating to the quantum of damages as outlined briefly in the preceding paragraph, one particular aspect of <i>liability</i> that is of particular importance, but which was <i>not</i>, apparently at least, canvassed <i>sufficiently</i> by all the counsel concerned at first instance. The focus before the trial court was on the alleged liability of <i>Cameron and Stork</i> to <i>the plaintiffs</i>. However, what seemed to us of greater significance in so far as the <i>present proceedings</i> were concerned was, instead, the issue of liability <i>between Cameron and Stork</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the focus at trial, it is not surprising, therefore, that the Judge appeared to decide this particular issue on the basis of Cameron\u2019s and Stork\u2019s <i>tortious</i> liability <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the plaintiffs <i>only</i>, and did not seem to additionally make any determination on whether their respective liabilities to the plaintiffs had been caused by breaches of duty or contract between them <i>inter se</i> for which an indemnity could be sought. In the event, as already mentioned, the Judge held that, as both Cameron and Stork were found to be equally culpable for the damage caused to the plaintiffs, Cameron was entitled to a declaration that Stork was to indemnify Cameron to the extent of Stork\u2019s share of the damage (caused to the plaintiffs) assessed at 50%. The important issue that arises in this regard and which was not (as we have alluded to above) canvassed adequately by counsel concerned at first instance was the situation of liability in <i>contract</i> as between Cameron and Stork. This issue is especially significant in the light of the fact that, under present Singapore law, the allocation of liability between the parties in the context of contributory negligence can (as we shall see) only take place where there is <i>concurrent liability in contract and tort</i> (here, between Cameron and Stork). This requires, in turn, an analysis of what the precise situation between Cameron and Stork was in the present proceedings and, in particular, the precise nature of the terms (both express and implied) of the contract that they had entered into. Although the learned trial judge did advert to this particular issue very briefly, this was in the context of the issue of liability with respect to the plaintiffs instead (see GD at [119]\u2013[121]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to consider (in turn) the two specific points of focus set out above. To recapitulate, the first centres on the issue of <i>remedies</i> \u2013 in particular, in relation to primarily <i>evidential</i> points. The second pertains to the ascertainment of the precise legal relationship (and, hence, allocation of liability) between Cameron and Stork. After considering these two main points of focus, we will then proceed to deal briefly with the rest of the issues, most of which were not pressed to any great extent by the various counsel concerned in the present appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The quantum of damages and the Damages Bundle</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not surprisingly, counsel for the plaintiffs in this appeal, Mr\u00a0K\u00a0Shanmugam\u00a0SC, focused on the Damages Bundle. It was crucial inasmuch as it (as we have already mentioned) contained a very detailed rendition of the alleged damage caused to the plaintiffs. Without it, the plaintiffs\u2019 victory in so far as the issue of liability was concerned was almost a Pyrrhic one. We say \u201calmost\u201d because the Judge did in fact award the plaintiffs US$1m for the loss of the BOP stack and $10 nominal damages for the other heads of damage that had been pleaded. But this was a far cry from the plaintiffs\u2019 total claim, which was in the region of some US$22m.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We begin with the simple \u2013 yet time-honoured \u2013 legal proposition that a plaintiff can only be awarded damages if such damages have been <i>proved</i>. To put it another way, the mere proof of liability on the part of the defendant is only one of the pre-requisites. Absent the proof just mentioned, the plaintiff would be awarded only nominal damages in vindication of its legal rights.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proof, in so far as the plaintiffs in the present proceedings are concerned, was contained in the Damages Bundle. The Judge, as we have noted, held that the documents contained in this bundle (\u201cthe Documents\u201d) had not been properly admitted into evidence. Without these documents, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was, in effect, emasculated. In order to persuade this court that the Documents ought to be admitted, counsel for the plaintiffs rested his argument on two main planks. The plaintiffs would succeed on the issue of authenticity if they were successful on either plank.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first main plank rested on an exchange which took place before the Judge. In essence, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that this exchange evidenced an agreement by the parties to the effect that the authenticity of the Documents would not be an issue. Put another way, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument was that the defendants had waived any objections to the authenticity of the Documents. The only legal issue was that of the truth of the contents and centred, in this regard, on the question of hearsay. The plaintiff\u2019s <i>written submissions</i> also refer to a series of <i>correspondence</i> between the parties which are <i>also</i> alleged to evince an agreement to like effect \u2013 a point which we will in fact deal with first (at [27] below). Mr\u00a0Shanmugam further raised a closely related argument which, however, was phrased at a much broader level. He argued that, in any event, it was unconscionable for the defendants to raise any objections to the authenticity of the Documents and that such objections constituted an abuse of the process of the court; in the premises, he argued that the defendants ought to be estopped from raising such objections.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The other main plank relied upon by Mr\u00a0Shanmugam was that since HR filed his SAEIC together with the attached documents, the authenticity of these documents was no longer in issue; only the truth or veracity of the documents remained to be determined.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is apposite to note, at this juncture, that even if the plaintiffs succeeded in the present appeal on the issue relating to the authenticity of the Documents, they had to surmount one further legal hurdle. Indeed, this particular hurdle has already been mentioned above but bears repeating. The plaintiffs had also to prove, to the satisfaction of the present court, that the contents of the Documents were true. In particular, they had to surmount the objection stemming from the rule against hearsay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn, now, to consider each of the main planks relied upon by counsel for the plaintiffs with regard to the issue of the authenticity of the Documents before proceeding to consider the objection stemming from the rule against hearsay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The plaintiffs\u2019 first argument</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first main plank derives, firstly (and examining the situation from the perspective of dealing with documentary evidence), from a series of correspondence between the lawyers for the plaintiffs on the one hand and the lawyers for Cameron and Stork on the other.</span><a id=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 6]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">On close examination of this correspondence, however, we are unable to find that there had been an agreement as such between the parties that the Documents would be admitted into evidence. On the contrary, there is nothing in this series of correspondence which suggests that counsel for the defendants had in fact resiled from, or compromised in any way, the <i>objections</i> that they had taken during the trial itself and which we refer to in more detail below (at [68]\u2013[71]). In their written submissions, the plaintiffs do refer to the facsimile from <i>their own</i> lawyers dated 5\u00a0November 2004 to the defendants\u2019 lawyers.</span><a id=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 7]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">However, the <i>plaintiffs\u2019</i> own understanding of the situation does <i>not necessarily</i> translate into an agreement on the part of all the parties concerned \u2013 especially when we take into account their obvious self-interest in the matter. It is true that the facsimile from counsel for Stork dated 6\u00a0November 2004</span><a id=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 8]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">might lend some ostensible support to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in this regard. However, this last-mentioned response is not, in our view, unambiguous and, in any event, there does not appear to be a similar response from counsel for Cameron.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first main plank of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument also derives from the following exchange during the second day of the trial which, because of its obvious importance, is set out in full as follows:</span><a id=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 9]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Tan [Counsel for Stork]: I have no further questions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her Honour: Re-examination?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Chandra [Counsel for the plaintiffs]: Your Honour, just one point. Under <i>order\u00a027, rule\u00a04</i>, the \u201cAdmission and production of documents specified in list of documents\u201d, specifically in rule 4 it says:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cSubject to paragraph\u00a0(2) and without prejudice to the right of a party to object to the admission in evidence of any document, a party on whom a list of documents is served in pursuance of any provision of order 24 or any order made thereunder shall, unless the court otherwise orders, be deemed to admit --</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that any document described in the list as an original document ...</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 that any document described herein as a copy is a true copy.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">So the authenticity question insofar as I have no objections, therefore I will now, if my learned friend says he challenges that authenticity, which they have never said --</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her Honour: He has lost the right by now to do that.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Chandra: Yes, he has lost his right. He is making a separate point.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: He is making a separate point.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Chandra: He is making a point really on -- I need to know the parameters here of interpretation or authenticity.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: What he really means <i>if</i> he has given up the right <i>under order\u00a027, rule\u00a04</i>, you don't have to bring the maker.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Chandra: Yes, I don\u2019t have to bring the maker.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: But you still need to prove the document in the sense that you have to bring somebody who knows of the document so that they can cross-examine the person on the document.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Chandra: Very well.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: So somebody who was involved and can give some personal knowledge is really somebody who you should bring.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Chandra: Very well, Your Honour. In that case, may I have five minutes to confer with my clients before I just resume the re-examination of the witness on those issues that he is able to speak of directly, because there are some issues that he can, clearly on the operational aspect, there are some issues that he can\u2019t clearly as he said he wasn\u2019t involved in it. So I just want to segregate those two points, speak to my instructing solicitors on this matter and then commence re-examination, if I could have --</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: All right, we will take a five-minute recess.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Chandra: Until quarter to 4, Your Honour?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: Yes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, however, the exchange set out above ought not be read in isolation. In other words, it must be read in the <i>context</i> of the proceedings as a whole. We would observe that if this particular argument by the plaintiffs is to succeed, there must be clear evidence of an agreement by the parties concerned to the effect that the authenticity of the documents in question was not an issue. We do not see this arising at all from the exchange set out above. Indeed, the Judge appears to have nevertheless alluded to the fact that authenticity was still an issue. In any event, the focus appeared to be on O\u00a027 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2004\u00a0Rev Ed), which we find is not ultimately relevant in the context of the present proceedings (see [73] below). On the whole, in fact, this particular exchange appears to be rather ambiguous, at best.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the contrary, what clinches the case, so to speak, against the plaintiffs in so far as this particular argument is concerned is the fact that we find <i>the precise opposite</i> occurring in the form of <i>clear</i> <i>objections taken by the defendants and which were noted by the Judge herself</i> (see generally below at [72]). Further, in so far as the exchange last quoted was concerned, this took place on the <i>same day</i> of trial as the <i>objections</i> taken by the defendants.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the plaintiffs also briefly relied, as noted above, on a broader argument that had its source in the concept of fairness in general and the doctrine of estoppel in particular. In this regard, he relied on the Australian High Court decision of <i>The Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen</i> (1990) 170\u00a0CLR 394.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The doctrine of estoppel, like all legal doctrines, must be proved. It is not even clear that counsel for the plaintiffs was utilising the doctrine proper although he was certainly relying on the <i>spirit</i> underlying it \u2013 which is to prevent unconscionable conduct. This much is, in our view, clear from his reference to an alleged abuse of the process of court by the defendants. With respect, however, the argument was run too vaguely and altogether too briefly. As for the argument from fairness, this is dealt with when we consider a similar argument in a related context below (at [40]\u2013[65]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most importantly, however, is the fact that <i>the Judge herself</i> made a clear finding to the effect that the parties had <i>not</i> entered into the agreement so strenuously argued for by Mr\u00a0Shanmugam. As she put it, \u201c[t]here was also <i>no agreement</i> to dispense with formal proof of the claims for damages\u201d [emphasis added] (GD at [145]). Indeed, as we shall see below, the Judge actually held <i>the precise opposite \u2013</i> that the defendants had, instead, <i>objected to</i> the introduction of the Documents (see [68]\u2013[71] below). Mr\u00a0Shanmugam, however, sought to argue that the Judge had somehow been mistaken and had missed what in his view was the crucial exchange set out above. In the first instance, we have found that that exchange did not support the argument that there had indeed been an agreement between the parties with regard to the introduction of the Documents. More to the point, it is highly unlikely, in our view, that the Judge could have overlooked this very crucial point, dealing with a very crucial part of the case. Mr\u00a0Shanmugam argued that this was possible in the light of the length of the proceedings. We are of the view that the length of the proceedings as well as the volume of documents are not material considerations in this regard. A trial judge is present throughout the proceedings and is fully cognisant of all that has transpired. More importantly, the trial judge constantly sifts the substantive legal wheat from the irrelevant legal as well as extra-legal chaff and notes the former down accordingly. Indeed, it is <i>precisely</i> because this issue was a crucial one that all the relevant facts that had led the Judge to the conclusion she arrived at must have been of <i>especial significance</i> to her <i>in the midst of</i> the lengthy proceedings themselves. She would have in fact been the <i>best</i> person to assess whether or not the defendants had objected to the Documents simply because she was, as we have mentioned, present throughout the proceedings. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument on this particular issue must fail.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The plaintiffs\u2019 second argument</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second main plank of the plaintiffs\u2019 case with respect to the issue of the authenticity of the Documents centred on the Malaysian Federal Court decision of <i>Palaniappa Chettiar v Tan Jan</i> <nobr>[1965] 1 MLJ 182</nobr> (\u201c<i>Palaniappa Chettiar</i>\u201d). In that case, Thomson\u00a0LP held that a document which was exhibited to an affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) should be treated as though it were copied out in the affidavit itself. Counsel for the plaintiffs therefore argued that, in the present proceedings, the Documents were admitted into evidence when the SAEIC was filed in court and tendered through its deponent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This argument was attractive at first blush. However, on closer scrutiny, we found that it could not apply to the present proceedings and, in particular, that <i>Palaniappa Chettiar</i> was not in fact applicable in the context of the present case. Let us elaborate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What <i>Palaniappa Chettiar</i> decided was that where the deponent of an AEIC signed the affidavit concerned, he or she was also deemed to have signed the documents exhibited to it as well. In other words, the <i>contents</i> of the AEIC would be deemed to <i>include</i> the <i>contents</i> of the documents exhibited to it as well. <i>However</i>, the crucial issue before this court was <i>quite different</i>; it concerned the issue as to whether or not <i>the actual documents themselves were admitted into evidence together with the affidavit itself</i>. If, in fact, documents such as those involved in the present appeal were <i>automatically</i> admitted <i>into evidence</i> by virtue of the fact that they were exhibited to the affidavit concerned <i>without more</i>, this would, in our view, <i>enable parties to circumvent the relevant rules and principles embodied within the Evidence Act (Cap\u00a097, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed) which are intended to ensure that only the best evidence is admitted into evidence</i>. Indeed, such an argument, if accepted, would, with respect, make <i>a mockery of</i> the rules and principles in the Evidence Act. In an extreme situation, <i>wholly bogus documents</i> could be admitted simply because the deponent of the affidavit had exhibited them to the affidavit itself. To be sure, the documents concerned would constitute part of his AEIC, but <i>whether or not such documents could be admitted into evidence as authentic documents would depend on whether or not they satisfied the requisite criteria contained in the Evidence Act or fell within the relevant exceptions contained therein</i>. To take another (and less extreme) situation, if the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is accepted, then the deponent of the affidavit could exhibit <i>any manner</i> of document. In such a situation, is the court to <i>assume</i> that such documents have satisfied the legal requirements under the Evidence Act? Is not the other party (the defendants in the present proceedings) legally entitled to object to the authenticity of the Documents and require that they be admitted <i>in accordance with the proper rules of evidence</i>? After all, do not the rules and principles of evidence (particularly as embodied within the Evidence Act) serve a <i>purpose</i> (indeed, an <i>important</i> purpose)?

Syed Amir Ali\u2019s Law of Evidence</i> (Butterworths, 17th\u00a0Ed, 2001) vol\u00a0II (\u201c<i>Woodroffe &amp; Amir Ali</i>\u201d) at pp\u00a02849\u20132850 and 2884). That is why the general rule (again, in s\u00a066) is that all documents must be proved by primary evidence, with \u201cprimary evidence\u201d being defined (in s\u00a064) as meaning \u201c<i>the document itself</i> produced for the inspection of the court\u201d [emphasis added]. Section\u00a066 does, however, expressly provide for an exception where <i>secondary</i> evidence might be given <i>in the circumstances set out in s\u00a067</i>. Applying these straightforward principles to the present appeal, it is clear, first, that the requirements in s\u00a066 have not been satisfied. At <i>no</i> stage in the proceedings before the Judge were the <i>original documents</i> produced. Secondly, it is equally clear that the requirements in s\u00a067 were not satisfied either.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this juncture, because Mr\u00a0Shanmugam did make some passing reference to the parol evidence rule as embodied within ss\u00a093 and 94 of the Evidence Act, we need to observe (also in passing) that this last-mentioned set of provisions must be <i>distinguished from</i> those presently considered (<i>viz</i>, ss\u00a063\u201367 of the Evidence Act). It is true that there could be some overlap or even coincidence where the evidence concerned falls within the purview of ss\u00a093 and 94. However, absent such a <i>factual</i> coincidence, these last-mentioned provisions do in fact serve quite different purposes (and see, for example, <i>Sarkar</i> at p\u00a01074). As a leading textbook also puts it (see <i>Woodroffe &amp; Amir Ali</i> at pp\u00a02886\u20132887):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The provisions [<i>sic</i>] of s\u00a064 [of the Indian Evidence Act, which is the equivalent of s\u00a066 of the Singapore Evidence Act] must be distinguished from those of s\u00a091 [of the Indian Evidence Act, which is the equivalent of s\u00a093 of the Singapore Evidence Act]. The latter deals with matters which the parties have put in writing or which the law requires to be in writing. In such cases, except where secondary evidence may be given, the document is an exclusive record of that which it embodies. The parties are not at liberty to resort to other evidence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">All that the present section [<i>viz</i>, s\u00a064 of the Indian Evidence Act] says is that if it is desired to prove the contents of a document, the document itself must, save in certain exceptional cases, be produced. But, if a writing does not fall within either of the classes already described, no reason exists, why it should exclude oral evidence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Of impracticality, unfairness and balance</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the plaintiffs sought \u2013 indirectly, at least \u2013 to suggest that it was both impractical as well as unfair to expect the plaintiffs to satisfy the above-mentioned provisions, especially since the number of documents was voluminous. However, such arguments from practicality and fairness must have a legal basis. In fact, the legal basis that is relevant to the present proceedings appear to point in the <i>opposite</i> direction in so far as the plaintiffs are concerned. As we have seen, the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act (in particular, ss\u00a066 and 67 thereof) indicate that the plaintiffs have not in fact satisfied the requisite legal requirements from an evidential perspective. Indeed, in so far as the concept of fairness is concerned, the whole rationale underlying these various provisions is to ensure that fairness results to <i>both</i> parties, including (here) <i>the defendants</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note, however, that our Evidence Act was promulgated in its original form over one hundred years ago. The quantity and quality of documents has, unsurprisingly, increased as well as changed in the interim. Hence, the arguments that counsel for the plaintiffs have raised in so far as practicality and fairness are concerned cannot be dismissed out of hand. They embody the classic tensions that often run through most areas of the law. One is the tension between efficiency and fairness. However, the two are not incompatible. In fact, the former is itself one conception of fairness. Further, fairness is, as we have alluded to in the preceding paragraph, a concept that ought to result to both parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another tension is to give effect both to the original intention underlying the statutory provisions concerned as well as to the changed circumstances which were not (in the nature of things) envisaged or contemplated at the time those provisions were enacted. It is true that it is often the case that both are irreconcilable. One issue that arises is whether or not this is the situation here. If so, then this court must leave any reform to the Singapore parliament itself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Put simply in the context of the present proceedings, the tension appears to be as follows: How should the court give effect to the underlying rationale of (in particular) ss\u00a066 and 67 of the Evidence Act on the one hand, as well as ensure, on the other hand, that by giving effect to this rationale, inefficiency and unfairness do not ensue as a result? This latter consideration \u2013 not, perhaps, present at the time the Evidence Act was <i>originally</i> introduced in the local context \u2013 should not, in our view, be ignored because to do so would be tantamount to ignoring the practical realities in a changed (and ever-changing) legal milieu.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By way of preliminary observation, although it is true that a copious number of documents were involved in the present proceedings, it is equally true that any problems of authenticity could have been surmounted (as they often are in cases of this nature) by an agreed bundle of documents, although (unfortunately) this was not the case here. However, it must be emphasised that whilst formal proof of the documents concerned is dispensed with by an agreed bundle of documents, the <i>truth</i> of their contents will still have to be proved in the absence of any agreement or admission to the contrary. In this regard, the observations in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Goh Ya Tian v Tan Song Gou</i> [1980\u20131981] SLR\u00a0578 at 581, [12] are too broad inasmuch as they suggest that the proof of the truth of the contents of the documents concerned is also dispensed with and, to that extent, ought not to be followed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, when counsel for Stork, Mr\u00a0Alvin Yeo\u00a0SC, was posed a question as to practicality when so many documents were involved, he referred precisely to the solution in the form of an agreed bundle of documents; where there was no such agreed bundle, which situation he conceded was the right of any party in litigation to insist upon, Mr\u00a0Yeo argued that parties (again, pursuant to their respective rights in litigation) had the prerogative of objecting to any documents tendered \u2013 with any sanctions lying in the sphere of an order for costs. As we explain below, we are of the view that this last-mentioned point is (subject to the issue of timing) generally correct. If the parties cannot come to the more felicitous arrangement where there is in fact an agreed bundle, then each must face the consequences of a potentially \u201cmessier\u201d situation in so far as the admission of documents into evidence is concerned. Unfortunately, this was precisely the situation here \u2013 but with a slight (albeit vitally significant) difference. The defendants were within their legal rights to object to the Documents tendered by the plaintiffs. But we did not perceive counsel for the plaintiffs to be arguing that the Damages Bundle should have been admitted on the basis that no objections had in fact been taken by the defendants in the instant case to it. As we have seen, counsel for the plaintiffs relied, instead, on the argument to the effect that the defendants had in fact agreed to admit the Damages Bundle, which was a somewhat different argument and indeed imposed, in our view, a heavier onus of proof on the plaintiffs and which we did not accept.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs were therefore under at least a <i>prima facie</i> legal duty to comply with the requirements of the relevant provisions under the Evidence Act. They did not. The relevant statutory provisions are there for a purpose. However, as we have already pointed out above, an insistence \u2013 without more \u2013 on a strict compliance with these provisions might lead to undesirable practical consequences. Is there a <i>balanced</i> approach that enables the objectives of such provisions to be achieved without deleterious practical effects?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, a balanced approach might entail the following principles. However, because we were <i>not</i> (unfortunately, in our view) addressed <i>fully</i> on them (<i>cf</i>, especially, [66] below), they are proffered only by way of preliminary observations only. More importantly, any <i>definitive</i> approach adopted would have <i>wide-ranging</i> <i>implications</i> in an extremely important area of legal practice; hence, there is a need for a more considered hearing before a definitive approach is laid down by this court. It is therefore hoped that this court will hear fuller arguments in a future decision. Nevertheless, we do not feel that, the point having been necessarily raised as an integral part of the present proceedings, we can simply ignore it. However, we would also like to emphasise the fact that <i>even if</i> the principles we are about to set out by way of an exploratory analysis, so to speak, are in fact applicable (and hence applied) to the present case, it would make <i>no difference</i> to the result we have arrived at \u2013 as will be evident from our analysis below (at [67]\u2013[73]). Given the fact that the difficulties centring on the application of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act were in effect raised by the parties in the present case, we feel that our (albeit preliminary) views not only provide a point of departure for a future decision of this court but also (if we may be permitted this musical analogy) constitute (in part at least) a closing bar of sorts to what would otherwise have been an awkward and jarring pause in a movement initiated (but unfinished) by the parties themselves. We now turn, therefore, briefly to these views.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Firstly, we must begin with the general principle that the party who wishes to introduce the documents concerned into evidence must comply with the salient provisions of the Evidence Act (and see, for example, the Indian Privy Council decision of <i>Krishna Kishori Chowdhrani v Kishori Lal Roy</i> (1887) 14\u00a0IA 71). To begin with, any other premise would ignore the clear provisions of the Act. Worse still, it would be a signal to parties to be indisciplined in so far as the introduction of documents is concerned. It would then be the thin end of the procedural wedge and might even lead to the fraudulent introduction of documents. The fact that there is another legal barrier in the form of testing the truth of the contents of documents is no excuse for lowering the barrier in relation to the authenticity of documents under the salient provisions of the Evidence Act, and which would itself constitute an important threshold safeguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, however, it is also important to ensure that \u2013 at the other extreme \u2013 parties who wish (in <i>good faith</i>) to introduce documents to support their case are not put through an unnecessary procedural treadmill. An extreme example would be a situation where a party has to rely upon thousands of documents to establish his or her case in complex litigation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is also a broader policy reason why an overly punctilious insistence on compliance with the provisions in the Evidence Act for its own sake is undesirable. If it is the case that a party is placed with the positive burden of producing original documents or calling the maker of the documents sought to be introduced into evidence, this would entail (particularly in situations akin to that outlined in the preceding paragraph) an enormous waste of court time and resources in the event that the party seeking to introduce the documents concerned is seeking to do so in good faith. That being said, it is of course open to the opposing party to <i>object</i> to the admission of the documents concerned and insist that the other party produce the original documents or the maker of the documents concerned. That is his or her prerogative. But what if such an objection is frivolous or vexatious? It is our view that if it can be demonstrated that this is in fact the case, then sanctions can be imposed by way of an order for <i>costs</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are therefore of the view that whilst, as an important point of departure, a party seeking to introduce documents into evidence ought to comply with the provisions in the Evidence Act, if these documents are in fact marked and admitted into evidence without that party in fact satisfying the requirements in the Evidence Act <i>and</i> where there has been <i>no objection taken by the other party at that particular point in time</i>, then that other party <i>cannot</i> object to the admission of the said documents later. This last-mentioned proposition applies, of course, in an <i>a fortiori</i> manner when the party who had not objected to the introduction of the documents subsequently <i>cross-examines</i> the relevant witnesses on these documents in an attempt to discredit the truth of the contents stated therein. We note that whilst this particular argument was in fact raised in the plaintiffs\u2019 <i>written submissions</i>, they were <i>not</i> the <i>direct</i> focus during oral argument before this court. This particular argument was addressed <i>indirectly</i> inasmuch as counsel for the plaintiffs emphasised (as we have noted above) the argument from both impracticality and unfairness. However, if at all, this would have constituted the <i>legal basis</i> for the much more general argument just referred to. As a result, however, this particular point was not really (let alone effectively) addressed by all counsel concerned. More importantly, the extremely important issue as to how a <i>balance</i> was to be achieved in the light of the presence of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act was not addressed by counsel for the parties. This was indeed the much more important (and broader) legal canvas of which this point from objecting to the introduction of documents into evidence (although an important point) is only a part.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We pause here to note that the approach suggested in the preceding paragraph relating to the fact as well as time of objecting to the introduction of documents is in fact supported by an extremely lengthy line of Indian case law. Bearing in mind the fact that the Singapore Evidence Act (as already noted) had its roots in the Indian Evidence Act, these authorities are of no inconsiderable persuasive value if they are otherwise consistent with general logic, principle as well as justice and fairness, and are not inconsistent with the socio-economic mores of Singapore itself. As just noted, the number of Indian decisions is enormous (and see generally <i>Sarkar</i> at pp\u00a01076 and 1084 as well as <i>Woodroffe &amp; Amir Ali</i> at pp\u00a02855, 2860\u20132861, 2876, 2900\u20132901 and 2902), and we can but touch on some illustrative cases only. Significantly, none of these foremost textbooks on the law of evidence avoids the analysis of the equivalent of ss\u00a063\u201367 of the Evidence Act; on the contrary, the discussion and analysis in these works is both scholarly and perceptive <i>and</i> includes the discussion of this point <i>without any sense of contradiction at all</i> (see generally <i>Sarkar</i> at ch\u00a0V and <i>Woodroffe &amp; Amir Ali</i> at ch\u00a05). This supports the approach adopted here to the effect that a <i>balance</i> can (and ought to be) struck between upholding the rationale and integrity of ss\u00a063\u201367 of the Evidence Act on the one hand and achieving a practical and workable result on the other. Suffice it to state that these cases just mentioned have one basic theme that is embodied within the following words by Sir\u00a0George Rankin, delivering the judgment of the Board in the Indian Privy Council decision of <i>Gopal Das v Sri Thakurji</i> AIR 1943 Privy Council 83, as follows (at 87):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where the objection to be taken is not that the document is in itself inadmissible but that the mode of proof put forward is irregular or insufficient it is essential that the objection should be taken at the trial before the document is marked as an exhibit and admitted to the record. A party cannot lie by until the case comes before a Court of appeal and then complain for the first time of the mode of proof. A strictly formal proof might or might not have been forthcoming had it been insisted on at the trial. In the present instance, it does not appear that the objection was taken at the proper time or that it would have been of any avail had it been taken.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53</span><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Although the concepts of primary and secondary evidence as embodied within the provisions of the Evidence Act are of fundamental importance, the principle of <i>waiver</i> might apply if no objection is raised at the point in time when the evidence concerned is adduced: see, for example, <i>A\u00a0V\u00a0S Perumal v Vadivelu Asari</i> AIR\u00a01986 Mad 341 at [5]; <i>Rama Chandra Majhi v Hambai Majhi</i> 65\u00a0(1988) CLT 586 at 593; <i>The Land Acquisition Officer, Vijayawada Thermal Station v Nutalapati Venkata Rao</i> AIR\u00a01991\u00a0AP 31 at [19]; as well as <i>Woodroffe &amp; Amir Ali</i> at pp\u00a02904\u20132905. On the other hand, a failure to object could simply be construed as <i>an admission</i> that the requirements under the Evidence Act were complied with: see, for example, <i>State of Rajasthan v Jeo Raj</i> AIR\u00a01990\u00a0Raj 90 at [7].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reference may also be made, for example, to the Indian Supreme Court decisions of <i>Haji Mohammad Ekramul Haq v The State of West Bengal</i> AIR\u00a01959\u00a0SC 488 and <i>P\u00a0C\u00a0Purushothama Reddiar v S\u00a0Perumal</i> AIR\u00a01972\u00a0SC 608; the more recent Indian state decision of <i>S\u00a0A\u00a0Quddus v S\u00a0Veerappa</i> AIR\u00a01994\u00a0Kant 20; as well as (closer to home, so to speak) the Privy Council decision on appeal from the Court of Appeal of the Federated Malay States of <i>Bhagat Ram v Khetu Ram</i> AIR\u00a01929 Privy Council 110.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There has, however, been some suggestion that whilst the concept of objecting is relevant, the document concerned must also satisfy the criteria laid down for secondary documents under s\u00a065 of the Evidence Act (see, for example, <i>Kalyan Singh v Smt Chhoti</i> AIR\u00a01973\u00a0Raj 263, especially at [15]). The difficulty with such an approach is, however, that by its very terms, s\u00a065 does <i>not</i> appear to limit secondary documents <i>solely</i> to the categories listed therein.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We believe the approach we have outlined above would best achieve the balance required between ensuring that the best evidence is before the court without simultaneously burdening the party seeking to introduce the documents concerned <i>unnecessarily</i>. It would also ensure that the court\u2019s and the parties\u2019 valuable time is not wasted. The other party is of course free to object to the introduction of such documents at any time before the said documents are actually marked and admitted into evidence. If the objections are in fact effected frivolously or vexatiously, there can (as already mentioned) be sanctions imposed \u2013 principally in the form of an appropriate order as to costs. We would, however, strongly urge parties to have recourse \u2013 as far as is possible \u2013 to an agreed bundle of documents, leaving out only those significant documents that are the subject of dispute and ensuring that they are clearly objected to, at which time they will need to satisfy the relevant criteria laid down in the Evidence Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We pause here to observe, parenthetically, that given the fact that the relevant provisions in the Evidence Act (especially ss\u00a063\u201367) had been enacted over a century ago, there might be some justification for further legislative refinement. In this regard, we observe that the \u201cbest evidence rule\u201d has been eroded even in other jurisdictions over the intervening years. In particular, and this is particularly germane having regard to what we have just stated at the outset of this paragraph, one major issue that arises is whether or not this particular rule has kept pace, as it were, with changes in context. As was aptly put by the authors of a leading Canadian textbook on the law of evidence, \u201cthe rules of evidence should reflect the practices of modern society\u201d (see John Sopinka, Sidney N\u00a0Lederman &amp; Alan W\u00a0Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (Butterworths, 1992) at p\u00a0940). More specifically, in another leading (here, English) textbook, it is observed thus of the \u201cbest evidence rule\u201d (see <i>Phipson on Evidence</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 16th\u00a0Ed, 2005) at para\u00a07-39):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">About the beginning of the nineteenth century, however, a notable reaction set in; and from that date forward, \u2026 the decisions of the courts show <i>a persistent rescission from the \u201cbest evidence\u201d principle.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Further, this particular work concludes thus (at para\u00a07-45):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Thus, it would appear that the best evidence rule has, <i>in civil cases at least</i>, been <i>consigned to the history books</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>modern</i> approach towards the \u201cbest evidence rule\u201d, is in fact encapsulated within the following words of Balcombe\u00a0LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision in <i>Ventouris v Mountain (No\u00a02)</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 WLR 887</nobr> at 899:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The modern tendency in civil proceedings is to admit all relevant evidence, and the judge should be trusted to give only proper weight to evidence which is not the best evidence \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a similar vein, in an earlier decision of the English Divisional Court in <i>Kajala v Noble</i> (1982) 75\u00a0Cr\u00a0App\u00a0R 149, Ackner\u00a0LJ (as he then was) observed thus (at 152):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The old rule, that a party must produce the best evidence that the nature of the case will allow, and that any less good evidence is to be excluded, has gone by the board long ago. The <i>only remaining instance</i> of it is that, if an original document is available in one\u2019s hands, one must produce it; that one cannot give secondary evidence by producing a copy. Nowadays we <i>do not confine</i> ourselves to the best evidence. <i>We admit all relevant evidence. The goodness or badness of it goes only to weight, and not to admissibility</i>: Garton <i>v.</i> Hunter [1969] 1\u00a0All E.R. 451, <i>per</i> Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0M.R. at 453e; see also <i>Archbold, Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice</i> (40th\u00a0ed.), para.\u00a01001. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>However</i>, even \u201cthe only remaining instance\u201d referred to in the quotation in the preceding paragraph was \u201cdiluted\u201d in the English Divisional Court decision of <i>Regina v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex parte Osman</i> <nobr>[1990] 1 WLR 277</nobr>, where Lloyd\u00a0LJ, delivering the judgment of the court, observed thus (at 308):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">What is meant by a party having a document available in his hands? We would say that it means that a party who has the original of the document with him in court, or could have it in court without any difficulty. In such a case, if he refuses to produce the original and can give no reasonable explanation, the court would infer the worst. The copy should be excluded. If, in taking that view, we are cutting down still further what remains of the best evidence rule, we are content. On the facts, the magistrate was entitled to hold that the prosecution had given a reasonable explanation for the absence of such originals as they failed to produce.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It is also significant, in our view, that the learned lord justice did (on a more general level) in fact re-emphasise the emaciation of the \u201cbest evidence rule\u201d a little earlier on in his judgment (at 308), as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]his court would be more than happy to say goodbye to the best evidence rule. We accept that it served an important purpose in the days of parchment and quill pens. But since the invention of carbon paper and, still more, the photocopier and the telefacsimile machine, that purpose has largely gone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The situation appears, in fact, to have been taken a stage further, with \u201cthe only remaining instance\u201d referred to at [59] above being recently <i>rejected</i> by Jonathan Parker\u00a0LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Springsteen v Masquerade Music Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] EMLR 25</nobr> (with whom Laws and Waller\u00a0LJJ agreed); in the learned judge\u2019s words (at [80]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">For my part, I would not even recognise the continuing existence of that \u201cremaining instance\u201d of the application of \u201cthe old rule\u201d. In my judgment, the \u201cobligation\u201d of a party who has a document to produce the original in evidence is founded not on any rule of law but is simply a reflection of the fact that a party to whom a document is available will by reason of that very fact be unable to account to the satisfaction of the court for his non-production of it when inviting the court to admit secondary evidence of its contents, with the practical consequence that the court will attach no weight to the secondary evidence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, in a more general vein, the Jonathan Parker\u00a0LJ observed thus (at [85]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In my judgment, the time has now come when it can be said with confidence that the best evidence rule, long on its deathbed, has finally expired. In every case where a party seeks to adduce secondary evidence of the contents of a document, it is a matter for the court to decide, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, what (if any) weight to attach to that evidence. Where the party seeking to adduce the secondary evidence could readily produce the document, it may be expected that (absent some special circumstances) the court will decline to admit the secondary evidence on the ground that it is worthless. At the other extreme, where the party seeking to adduce the secondary evidence genuinely cannot produce the document, it may be expected that (absent some special circumstances) the court will admit the secondary evidence and attach such weight to it as it considers appropriate in all the circumstances. In cases falling between those two extremes, it is for the court to make a judgment as to whether in all the circumstances any weight should be attached to the secondary evidence. Thus, the \u201cadmissibility\u201d of secondary evidence of the contents of documents is, in my judgment, entirely dependent upon whether or not any weight is to be attached to that evidence. And whether or not any weight is to be attached to such secondary evidence is a matter for the court to decide, taking into account all the circumstances of the particular case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Once again, we find the modern approach reiterated to the effect that, generally speaking, all evidence will be admitted, with the focus being on the <i>weight</i> to be accorded to the evidence concerned instead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the more specific issue of <i>photocopied or xeroxed documents</i> is concerned, there are a number of Canadian decisions which are useful inasmuch as they demonstrate a <i>contrast</i> in approach. In the Provincial Court (Judicial District of Peel, Ontario) decision of <i>Regina v Lutz</i> (1978) 44\u00a0CCC (2d) 143, Langdon Prov Ct\u00a0J adopted a very pragmatic approach towards such documents that (in our view) is consistent with the modern context, as follows (at 150):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In 1978 the fact and reliability of the photostatic copying machine is a matter of such common experience that it needs no <i>person</i> to vouch for it. For example, voluminous authorities cited by counsel in argument on the issues in this case were handed to the Court in the form of obvious photostatic copies in the cases in questions [<i>sic</i>]. Counsel, I am sure, would be justifiably offended if I had requested an affidavit of comparison or notarial certificate before reading the documents submitted to the Court. The practice is one of obvious convenience and courtesy on the part of counsel for which the Court is grateful.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">That is not to say that a photostatic copying machine is foolproof or cannot be tampered with or cannot be so manipulated that it produces something other than a true copy, perhaps even indeed under appropriate circumstances, a false copy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">But surely, these are matters that go to the weight to be attributed to a photostatic copy, not to its admissibility.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast, however, Dryer\u00a0J, in the British Columbia Supreme Court decision of <i>Rogers v Hill</i> (1972) 29\u00a0DLR (3d) 628, required that a photocopy of a crucial document had to comply with the usual requirements stemming from the \u201cbest evidence rule\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We find, with respect, the approach adopted in <i>Regina v Lutz</i> to be more persuasive. It is also consistent with the modern approach that has already been set out in some detail above. We nevertheless reiterate that if the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act need to be amended to take into account an approach that is more consistent with the present context and societal mores, this will need to be effected by the Singapore parliament. We have set out the important changes in both law as well as legal principles in other jurisdictions only to highlight the obvious point that we must never lapse into \u201clegal complacency\u201d and that, as far as is possible, the law will need to move with the times.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>However</i>, and returning to the possible approach we have suggested above, we must reiterate, at this juncture, the crucial point that we were <i>not</i> addressed <i>fully</i> on this approach as well as the principles associated therewith. This being the case, we will leave it to a later decision of this court, which has in fact been addressed fully, to lay down a definitive and conclusive approach. In the meantime, however, we trust that parties will try their level best to arrive at agreed bundles of documents. If that is not possible, then we would strongly urge <i>both</i> parties to pay close attention to (especially) ss\u00a063\u201367 of the Evidence Act <i>as well as to</i> objections that might be taken to the introduction of specific documents themselves.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, as we have already pointed out above, <i>even if</i> the above principles were <i>applied</i> to the facts of the present case, we would affirm the Judge\u2019s decision on this particular issue. To begin with, we have found that there had <i>not</i> been an agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants that the Damages Bundle be admitted into evidence. However, in accordance with the principles which we have set out above, this is not the end of the matter. The issue then arises as to whether or not the defendants had <i>objected</i> to the introduction of the Damages Bundle into evidence. At this juncture, we should point out that what constitutes an objection depends on precisely what transpired in point of fact. More importantly, as the trial judge is in the best position to determine the issue, his or her views will necessarily carry great weight with this court; indeed, on many occasions, they may even be conclusive of the issue.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having closely perused the notes of evidence, we find that the defendants <i>had</i> indeed objected to the admission of the Documents. It is true that they did not object to specific documents but it must be borne in mind that the Damages Bundle constituted 12 volumes of documents. However, it is clear that counsel for the defendants were certainly unhappy with the introduction of these documents. We will not canvass each and every occasion which constituted an objection. However, the following exchanges are both instructive and illustrative. It is highly significant, in our view, that these exchanges occurred very early on (<i>viz</i><i>, the second day of the trial</i>) \u2013 the <i>very same day</i> on which the exchange relied upon by <i>the plaintiffs</i> took place (see [28] above). <i>Indeed, these exchanges will, as we shall see, demonstrate that the defendants were clearly objecting to all the plaintiffs\u2019 documents.</i> This is, of course, the <i>very antithesis</i> of an agreement that the Documents be admitted \u2013 a point which, as we have seen, counsel for the plaintiffs was arguing vigorously for.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning to the first exchange, this is what transpired:</span><a id=\"_ftnref10\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[note: 10]</span></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Gurbani [Counsel for Cameron]: Can I show you a letter.

There is nobody to prove the document, and why Mr\u00a0Tan is asking questions about the document that this man says he cannot prove I do not know, if it is his case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Gurbani:\u00a0 As far as the first defendant is concerned, I am not taking this particular point, because it is quite obvious from the assignment --</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her Honour: Which point? The last point?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Gurbani:\u00a0 Yes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: What about the proving of the document.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Gurbani:\u00a0 The proving of the document, I didn't put it in. That is why I never put in the deed of assignment at all.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: So as far as your client is concerned, you are happy to accept the existence of the assignment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Gurbani:\u00a0 No. I didn\u2019t put these questions to the witness at all. I never put in the document either. So Mr\u00a0Tan has got me into a bit of a quandary when he puts in the thing as AB. It is not AB as far as I am concerned. Just to be clear, it <i>is</i> not AB as far as the first defendant is concerned. Whatever point Mr\u00a0Tan wants to take, he can take. He is at liberty to take, whether assignment covers or does not cover. For me that document is not in evidence. That is all.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Chandra: I have to make one small point here. Every time a list of documents was filed, not one of my learned friends has objected to authenticity at all. I have not received any. If I have, I must have overlooked it. <i>Nobody has challenged the authenticity under the admission order. So I am where I am, and they must take it because they have not challenged that.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Gurbani:\u00a0 <i>What authenticity? This is the law of evidence. We all know that. We have been practising for so long. As far as we are concerned, if we don't agree that the document is -- we don\u2019t agree that the document need not be proven in the usual way, then it has to be proven the usual way. That is all there is to it. No one asked us otherwise.</i> But as far as I say, whatever documents I have put</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">in as AB, I have no problems with that. <i>But whatever I have not put in, they can prove in the usual way. I have no problems with that either.</i> So I am not sure what Mr Tan is getting at, but the only point I want to make as far as 4, 5 and 6 is concerned is not 4, 5 and 6AB, or agreed bundle as far as the first defendant is concerned.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her Honour: Yes, Mr Tan.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Tan:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your Honour, I think this point may well be something that will replay itself in different fashions, because there may be a situation in which Mr\u00a0Chandra and I will have an agreement that we are prepared to agree and Mr\u00a0Gurbani may disagree. So it is not the situation in which. I want to put my learned friend in a difficult position. But invariably there will be documents, Your Honour.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: So what is your position on all these three documents?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Tan: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I take the point up, Your Honour, primarily --</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: You are challenging the assignment?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Tan: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, I am challenging the assignment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: The legal effect of the assignment, of the documents?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Tan: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: But you are not challenging the authenticity of these documents?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Tan: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0Perret is not in a position to prove these documents either.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: Yes, so what position do you want to take? If he is not in a position to prove the document and nobody is coming to court to prove these documents, they are running --</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Tan: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps the best way, Your Honour, is mark this for identification only, rather than as an agreed bundle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Her\u00a0Honour: All right. We will renumber AB4, 5 and 6 to PI, P2 and P3 for identification only.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear from the above exchanges that the defendants were in fact <i>objecting</i> to <i>all</i> of the plaintiffs\u2019 documents. It appeared, indeed, to be a war of attrition amongst the parties on the documentary front as well.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More importantly, however, <i>the Judge herself</i> was of the view that the defendants were indeed <i>objecting</i> to the introduction of the Documents. In this regard, the following observations in her judgment are more than instructive (GD at [145]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As it transpired, there was no inspection of the documents in the two supplementary lists. There were no agreed bundles of documents. The documents were produced at the trial as plaintiffs\u2019 documents <i>and objections were taken on the documents in the course of the trial</i>. I agree with counsel for both the defendants that authenticity of the documents forming the \u201cDamages Bundle\u201d was not deemed admitted under O\u00a027 r\u00a04(1) as the time limit stipulated in r\u00a04(2) to which r\u00a04(1) is subject was not triggered. There was also no agreement to dispense with formal proof of the claims for damages. If O\u00a027 r\u00a04(1) applied or if an agreed bundle had been produced at trial, there would have been no need to produce the originals nor prove the existence or execution of the documents in question. However, it should be noted that O\u00a027 r\u00a04(1) is not concerned with admissibility. It is expressly stated in r\u00a04(1) that the sub-rule does not affect the right of a party to object to the admissibility of any document. Admissibility of the plaintiffs\u2019 documents was an issue before me. I should add that in the course of the trial, certain documents in the plaintiffs\u2019 bundle of documents were marked for identification. Marking a document for identification at a stage of a trial was a means of avoiding a debate then about authenticity and/or admissibility, <i>objections having been taken to the tender of the documents</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear, in our view, that the defendants had in fact objected to the introduction of the Documents. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs ought therefore to have satisfied the requisite requirements under the Evidence Act \u2013 in particular those contained in s\u00a066. On this ground alone, the Judge was correct in finding that the Documents were not admitted into evidence. That was, of course, fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 case in so far as the quantum of damages claimed was concerned. We should add that, in the light of this holding, it is unnecessary to delve into great detail on the possible issues arising from O\u00a027 r\u00a04 of the Rules of Court, except to note that our interpretation of O\u00a027 r\u00a04 differed from that of the Judge. At [145] of her GD, the Judge was of the view that authenticity of the Documents was not deemed admitted under O\u00a027 r\u00a04(1) as the time limit stipulated in r\u00a04(2) to which r\u00a04(1) is subject was not triggered. In our view, however, O\u00a027 r\u00a04(1) expressly provides that subject to r\u00a04(2), a party is deemed to admit the authenticity of the documents in his opponent\u2019s lists of documents. This suggests that the default position under the Rules of Court is that provided for in r\u00a04(1), namely, that a party is deemed to admit the authenticity of a document contained in his opponent\u2019s lists. That being the case, a party is generally deemed to admit authenticity unless he can bring himself within O\u00a027 r\u00a04(2) by showing that he had actually issued a notice of non-admission within the requisite window of time. Despite this, it is important to note that because we have found that the defendants had in fact objected to the Damages Bundle being introduced into evidence, it is no longer necessary to consider O\u00a027 r\u00a04.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The objection from hearsay</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to the issue of the truth or veracity of the documents in the Damages Bundle. Here, as we have already pointed out, the main objection by the defendants centres on the doctrine of hearsay (for an excellent discussion and analysis of the doctrine in the local context, see Jeffrey Pinsler, <i>Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process</i> (LexisNexis, 2nd\u00a0Ed, 2003) at ch\u00a04). The plaintiffs of course argue otherwise. The underlying rationale for the rule against hearsay is set out in a leading textbook as follows (see <i>Woodroffe &amp; Amir Ali</i> ([38] <i>supra</i>) at p\u00a01726):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The purpose and reason of the hearsay rule is the key to the exceptions to it, which are mainly based on two considerations: a necessity for the evidence and a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness. <i>Hearsay is excluded because it is considered not sufficiently trustworthy</i>. <i>It is rejected because it lacks the sanction of the tests applied to admissible evidence, namely, the oath and cross-examination</i>. But where there are special circumstances which give a guarantee of trustworthiness to the testimony, it is admitted even though it comes from a second-hand source.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">But it has not always been a question of absolute necessity. Sometimes practical convenience, sometimes inability to get evidence of the same value from the same or other source, have been regarded as sufficient. Impossibility, convenience, expediency have all played a part. It may be impossible, or it may cause unreasonable expense or delay, to procure the attendance of a witness who, if present, the court could give direct evidence on the matter in question, and it may also be that this witness has made a statement, either written or verbal, with reference to such matter under such circumstances that the truth of this statement may reasonably be presumed. In such a case, the law, as enacted by s 32, dispenses with direct oral evidence of the fact and with the safeguard for truth provided by cross-examination, and the sanction of an oath, the probability of the statement being true depending upon other safeguards which are mentioned in the following paragraphs. The truth of the declaration is deemed to be prima facie guaranteed by the special conditions of admissibility imposed. All the eight clauses of the section are based upon the principle that the statements are of such a nature or were made under such circumstances as to guarantee their being true.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">And, in the local context, Yong Pung How\u00a0CJ, in the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <i>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 234</nobr>, observed thus (at [27]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The rationale for the hearsay principle is that the witness cannot verify the truth of the facts of which he has no personal knowledge. As the person who does have personal knowledge of the facts is not in court, the accuracy of his perception and his veracity cannot be assessed and tested in cross-examination. Such evidence is unreliable and should hence be excluded from consideration. In Singapore, the rule against hearsay is reflected in s\u00a062 Evidence Act (Cap\u00a097, 1990\u00a0Ed).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should point out at this juncture that even if the plaintiffs succeed on the various arguments as to authenticity (which we have held they do not), in order to prevail, they must <i>also</i> prevail on this particular issue. Indeed, our findings on the issue of authenticity render it, strictly speaking, unnecessary to consider the objections based on hearsay. However, in deference to the vigorous arguments rendered by counsel and, in particular, in deference to the efforts made by counsel for the plaintiffs, we turn now to consider the arguments centring on hearsay. However, we should point out at the outset that we do not find the arguments for the plaintiffs on this particular issue persuasive and we find that they therefore fail on this particular issue as well.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is trite law that even where there is an agreed bundle of documents, the <i>truth</i> of the contents of the Documents nevertheless remains at issue and is subject to, <i>inter alia</i>, objections centring on the doctrine of hearsay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, it is also true that the rule against hearsay has come under increasing criticism and consequent calls for reform in many other jurisdictions. Significantly, perhaps, the rule itself was abolished in England in the context of civil proceedings (see, in particular, s\u00a01 of the UK Civil Evidence Act 1995 (c\u00a038) as well as <i>Cross and Tapper on Evidence</i> (LexisNexis, 10th\u00a0Ed, 2004) at ch\u00a0XIII and <i>Phipson on Evidence</i> ([57] <i>supra</i> at ch\u00a029)). But the rule against hearsay still serves an important function in the context of <i>criminal</i> proceedings (and see, especially, s\u00a0377 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap\u00a068, 1985\u00a0Rev Ed)). As we have already emphasised, however, any reform in this area, based as it must be on many policy factors, must necessarily be effected by the Singapore legislature, if at all. In other words, the plaintiffs in the present case must also be able to demonstrate that they can surmount any legal obstacles stemming from the rule against hearsay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we have already mentioned, we are of the view that the plaintiffs fail on this ground as well. They did not bring themselves within any of the potentially applicable exceptions to the rule against hearsay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note, first, Mr\u00a0Shanmugam\u2019s reliance on s\u00a035 of the Evidence Act (relating to computer output as evidence). However, this particular provision would appear to be more germane to the issue of <i>liability</i> (as opposed to the quantum of damages). The more salient provision would appear to be s\u00a032 of the same Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as s\u00a032 of the Evidence Act is concerned, the plaintiffs contended that the Judge had failed to consider evidence from John Sheed (the Vessel\u2019s subsea engineer) and Sean Roche (the Vessel\u2019s rig superintendent) that the makers of the documents had left JDL and their whereabouts were unknown. They went on to assert that courts often accepted that the conditions under s\u00a032 of the Evidence Act were satisfied as long as some evidence had been adduced on the unavailability of the relevant witnesses. We find the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments unpersuasive and agree with the Judge that s\u00a032(<i>b</i>) does not assist the plaintiffs in surmounting the rule against hearsay. Section\u00a032(<i>b</i>) itself reads as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></b> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">or is made in course of business;</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>b</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business or in the discharge of professional duty, or of an acknowledgment written or signed by him of the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind, or of a document used in commerce, written or signed by him, or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written or signed by him[.]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The requirements of s\u00a032(<i>b</i>) of the Evidence Act have not, in our view, been satisfied. In particular, it has been held that whether or not there is ground for holding that the relevant evidence cannot be procured without unreasonable delay or expense within the meaning of s\u00a033 of the Evidence Act is \u201cpurely a question of fact\u201d (see the Madras decision of <i>A\u00a0L\u00a0S\u00a0K\u00a0Kadappa Chetti v R\u00a0S\u00a0S\u00a0T Thirupathi Chetti</i> AIR\u00a01925\u00a0Mad 444 at 444, <i>per</i> Venkatasubba Rao\u00a0J).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, we also agree with the Judge that the plaintiffs had not surmounted the considerable evidential difficulties surrounding their claim. In particular, the Judge had found that there had been no expert evidence led as to the market or resale value of the equipment lost or damaged beyond repair. She also found that the loss of income on prospective future contracts was too remote. We agree with these findings which are supported by both the facts concerned as well as the relevant legal principles she has cited. Hence, even if the plaintiffs had managed to surmount the evidentiary difficulties (which we hold they had not), their claim would still have failed on more substantive grounds. In the event, the Judge, attempting her level best on the limited evidence left available to her, awarded US$1m for the lost BOP. We find nothing untoward in this commendable attempt to do justice between the parties in very difficult circumstances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the premises, we hold that the defendants ought to succeed with regard to <i>both</i> the issues of authenticity as well as hearsay, albeit for somewhat different reasons than that adopted by the Judge. In any event, we agree with the Judge\u2019s holding on the substantive issues and therefore affirm her decision on this particular issue relating to the quantum of damages in general and the legal status of the Damages Bundle in particular.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The issue of indemnity between Cameron and Stork</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Issues in the present proceedings</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning now to consider issues concerning <i>liability</i>, rather than <i>quantum</i>, the key question before us was whether Cameron should be entitled to a complete indemnity from Stork against its liability to the plaintiffs. Cameron averred that the sole cause of its liability to the plaintiffs was Stork\u2019s appointment of an inexperienced and unqualified person to conduct the investigation of the Standby Slip Joint. Under the refurbishment contract, Stork had an obligation to conduct a visual and dimensional inspection, which it failed to do. Thus, Stork was clearly in breach of the refurbishment contract, and was liable to Cameron for damages, which would be the entire amount of Cameron\u2019s liability to the plaintiffs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At first instance, the Judge held that Stork was liable to \u201cindemnify\u201d Cameron for 50% of the total damages payable to the plaintiffs. Such a result is <i>not</i>, however, possible <i>if</i> it is found that, under the <i>contract</i> between <i>Cameron and Stork</i>, Stork was in breach of contract. In <i>that</i> event, Stork would be liable to indemnify Cameron for the entire amount of Cameron\u2019s liability to the plaintiffs. By the same reasoning, if it is found that, under the contract between these parties, Cameron was in breach of contract, then Cameron would be liable to indemnify Stork for the entire amount of Stork\u2019s liability to the plaintiffs. In summary, therefore, what is crucial is an examination of the precise <i>contractual</i> terms \u2013 both express and (if any) implied \u2013 between the parties in the context of the relevant factual matrix in order to ascertain which party was in breach of contract. In this regard, we find that there was no real argument on the point made by counsel for the parties concerned. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Judge did not really consider the point.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>contract</i> between Cameron and Stork for refurbishment of the Standby Slip Joint imposed an obligation upon Stork to detect any deficiencies in the thickness of the Riser Box wall. In particular, Stork was under an obligation under the contract to conduct a dimensional inspection of the Riser Box in order to detect and repair any deficiencies found therein. That this is so is clear from the various provisions in the purchase order as well as the Quotation, both of which formed the documentary basis for the contract itself. We also note that Stork had issued a letter of compliance to Cameron, which represented that the Standby Slip Joint had been \u201cinspected, repaired and remanufactured and/or tested in accordance with the requirements of \u2026 Cooper Cameron Specs\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As it turned out, Prabhuram\u2019s failure to conduct a dimensional inspection of the Riser Box constituted, in our view, a breach of contract on the part of his employer, Stork. If so, then if Cameron\u2019s liability to pay damages to the plaintiffs can be regarded as \u201cthe <i>natural consequence</i> of [Stork\u2019s] breach of contract, or, in other words, a consequence which might reasonably be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties\u201d [emphasis added] (see <i>Mowbray v Merryweather</i> <nobr>[1895] 2 QB 640</nobr> at 643), then Cameron would be entitled to a full indemnity from Stork in so far as liability to the plaintiffs is concerned.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>However</i>, this is not, in our view, an end to the matter. Notwithstanding Stork\u2019s breach of contract, it is also the case that Cameron had not furnished it (Stork) with the requisite dimensional drawings. In this respect, Cameron submitted that it was <i>entitled</i> to assume that Stork knew how to carry out the dimensional inspection and what documents or drawings would be required for such an inspection. In response, Stork averred that Cameron, being the original equipment manufacturer for the Standby Slip Joint, had the primary responsibility to determine the scope of work to be carried out thereon. Accordingly, it was reckless for Cameron not to have provided the dimensional drawings to Stork.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that one would be hard-pressed to argue that the requirement to furnish such drawings was an express term of the contract. However, whilst this was <i>not</i> the breach of an <i>express</i> term of the contract as such, it was, in our view, nevertheless the breach of <i>an implied term to exercise reasonable care</i>. Mr\u00a0Gurbani had, nevertheless, argued that such an implied term, if it indeed existed, had not in any event been pleaded. Whilst a persuasive point at first blush, it is our view that such an implied term was not one that was implied \u201cin <i>fact</i>\u201d but was, rather, one that was implied under that <i>broader</i> category of \u201cterms implied in <i>law</i>\u201d. As I observed in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Private Ltd</i> <nobr>[2006] 1 SLR 927</nobr> at [42]\u2013[44]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a <i>second</i> category of implied terms [<i>viz</i>, \u201cterms implied in law\u201d] which is wholly different in its nature as well as practical consequences. Under this category of implied terms, once a term has been implied, such a term will be implied in <i>all future</i> contracts of <i>that particular type</i>. The precise terminology utilised has varied. In the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Shell UK Ltd v Lostock Garage Ltd</i> <nobr>[1976] 1 WLR 1187</nobr> at 1196, for example, Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR utilised the rubric of contracts \u201cof common occurrence\u201d, whilst Lloyd\u00a0LJ in the (also) English Court of Appeal decision of <i>National Bank of Greece SA v Pinios Shipping Co No\u00a01</i> <nobr>[1990] 1 AC 637</nobr> (reversed in the House of Lords but not on this particular point) referred to such a category as encompassing \u201ccontracts of a defined type\u201d (at 645). But the central idea is clear: it is that the term implied is implied in a <i>general</i> way for <i>all</i> specific contracts that come within the purview of a broader umbrella category of contracts (reference may also be made, for example, to the House of Lords decisions of <i>Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 AC 294</nobr>, especially at 307 and <i>Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA</i> <nobr>[1998] AC 20</nobr> at 45).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To distinguish this particular category of implied terms from the first, legal scholars have referred to it as the category of \u201cterms implied in <i>law</i>\u201d (see generally, for example, Sir\u00a0Guenter\u00a0Treitel, <i>The Law of Contract</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th\u00a0Ed, 2003) (\u201cTreitel\u201d) at pp\u00a0206\u2013213). The first or former category has, in turn, been referred [to as] the category of \u201cterms implied in <i>fact</i>\u201d (see generally Treitel, at pp\u00a0201\u2013206).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>rationale as well as test</i> for this broader category of implied terms is, not surprisingly, quite <i>different</i> from that which obtains for terms implied under the \u201cbusiness efficacy\u201d and \u201cofficious bystander\u201d tests. In the first instance, the category is much broader inasmuch (as we have seen) the <i>potential</i> for application <i>extends</i> to <i>future</i> cases relating to the same issue with respect to the <i>same category</i> of contracts. In other words, the decision of the court concerned to imply a contract \u201cin law\u201d in a particular case <i>establishes a precedent</i> for similar cases in the future for <i>all</i> contracts of <i>that particular type</i>, unless of course a higher court overrules this specific decision. Hence, it is my view that courts ought to be as \u2013 if not more \u2013 careful in implying terms on this basis, compared to the implication of terms under the \u201cbusiness efficacy\u201d and \u201cofficious bystander\u201d tests which relate to the <i>particular contract and parties only</i>. Secondly, the test for implying a term \u201cin law\u201d is broader than the tests for implying a term \u201cin fact\u201d. This gives rise to difficulties that have existed for some time, but which have only begun to be articulated relatively recently in the judicial context, not least as a result of the various analyses in the academic literature (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Crossley v Faithful &amp; Gould Holdings Ltd</i> [2004] 4\u00a0All ER 447 at [33]\u2013[46]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The category of \u201cterms implied in law\u201d is not without its disadvantages. A certain measure of uncertainty will always be an integral part of the judicial process and, hence, of the law itself. This is inevitable because of the very nature of life itself, which is \u2013 often to a very large extent \u2013 unpredictable. Such unpredictability and consequent uncertainty is of course a double-edged sword. It engenders both the wonder and awe as well as the dangers and pitfalls in life. Given this reality, however, one of the key functions of the courts is not to add unnecessarily to the uncertainty that already exists. Looked at in this light, the category of \u201cterms implied in law\u201d does tend to generate some uncertainty \u2013 not least because of the broadness of the criteria utilised to imply such terms, which are grounded (in the final analysis) on reasons of public policy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the category of \u201cterms implied in law\u201d has now been firmly woven into the tapestry of our local contract law. It also aids, on occasion at least, in achieving a just and fair result. Most importantly, perhaps, it has formed both the theoretical as well as practical basis for <i>statutory</i> implied terms, such as those found in the UK Sale of Goods Act 1979 (c\u00a054) (applicable in Singapore <i>via</i> the application of English Law Act (Cap\u00a07A, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed) and reprinted as Cap\u00a0393, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is clear, in our view, is that general reasons of justice and fairness as well as of public policy justify the implication of a \u201cterm implied in <i>law</i>\u201d in cases such as the present to the effect that each party (here, Cameron and Stork) would owe each other a duty to take reasonable care in the performance of the respective parts of the <i>contract</i> they had entered into. In the circumstances, Cameron\u2019s breach of contract would, if it stood <i>alone</i>, have entitled <i>Stork</i> to a complete indemnity from Cameron based on the same criteria set out above.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We do note Mr\u00a0Gurbani\u2019s argument on behalf of Cameron (and briefly alluded to above) that the issue relating to a \u201cterm implied in law\u201d was not pleaded. However, given the <i>very nature</i> of such a category of implied terms, we are of the view that it ought to be recognised by the court <i>as a matter of law</i>. We do reiterate that the parties themselves had not canvassed in an adequate manner the broader issue, of which the argument from implied terms is only a part. This was the issue of the <i>contractual position in relation to the respective claims for an indemnity by Cameron and Stork</i>. It was a vital issue. It was not something which this court could, with any sort of equanimity, afford to ignore. After all, the issue relating to an <i>indemnity</i> was raised in the pleadings and, of course, at the trial itself. But, at the risk of belabouring the point, it was not canvassed adequately. We could not now leave it \u201changing in the air\u201d, so to speak, especially since we are the final appellate court in so far as these proceedings are concerned. During the hearing before us, Mr\u00a0Gurbani himself was given an ample opportunity to argue that, based on the <i>contractual terms</i> between Cameron and Stork, Cameron was entitled to a full indemnity from Stork. Needless to say, he took this opportunity. Mr\u00a0Yeo was also given an ample opportunity to argue the point and he, too, took the opportunity, arguing his case on a number of different fronts (including, significantly in our view, the argument from an implied term). We see no injustice resulting to the parties. Indeed, as we have observed, a duty to take reasonable care in the performance of the contract arising from the implication of a term \u201cin law\u201d was applicable to <i>both</i> Cameron <i>and</i> Stork.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given that Cameron had breached an implied term (in law) to take reasonable care <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> its contract with Stork inasmuch as it had not furnished the requisite dimensional drawings to Stork, what, then, is the position with regard to Stork inasmuch as it (Stork) has <i>also</i>, as we have held, breached the same contract by not (according to the express terms of the contract) conducting a dimensional inspection of the Riser Box in order to detect and repair any deficiencies found therein?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are, in our view, two approaches open to this court with respect to the present factual matrix.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first is that the contractual duty by way of an implied term placed upon Cameron as discussed above is a <i>condition precedent</i> to the performance of the contractual duty placed by way of an express term upon Stork to conduct the dimensional inspection of the Riser Box. However, it is not in our view wholly clear that such an implied term was indeed a condition precedent. In any event, it is unnecessary to pursue this particular issue as we are of the view that by proceeding with the dimensional inspection of the Riser Box, Stork had <i>waived</i> any condition precedent that would have otherwise existed. Indeed, it might be persuasively argued that Stork had even waived the breach of the implied term by Cameron.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A second (and alternative) approach is to consider the situation on the basis that the implied term placed upon Cameron was <i>not</i> a <i>condition precedent</i>. This is in fact the approach that we must now focus on, given our rejection of the first approach as set out briefly in the preceding paragraph. In the circumstances, therefore, we must proceed on the basis that <i>both</i> Cameron and Stork had breached their contract and consider the legal consequences of the respective breaches accordingly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This situation (where both parties are in breach of contract) has not, to the best of our knowledge, received much treatment in the case law. However, the following observations by Kerr\u00a0LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>State Trading Corporation of India Ltd v M Golodetz Ltd</i> [1989] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 277 at 286 are apposite:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The fact that in the present case both parties had committed breaches before one of them elected to treat the contract as repudiated appears to me to make no difference whatever; nor the fact that (assumedly) both had been breaches of condition. <i>If A is entitled to treat B as having wrongfully repudiated the contract between them and does so, then it does not avail B to point to A\u2019s past breaches of contract, whatever their nature.</i> A breach by A would only assist B if it was still continuing when A purported to treat B as having repudiated the contract <i>and</i> [this emphasis is in the original text] if the effect of A\u2019s subsisting breach was such as to preclude A from claiming that B had committed a repudiatory breach. In other words, B would have to show that A, being in breach of an obligation <i>in the nature of a condition precedent</i>, was therefore not entitled to rely on B\u2019s breach as a repudiation. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The observations just quoted are both logical and principled. Applying them to the facts before us, we have already held that the implied term of the contract which was breached by Cameron was <i>not</i> a condition precedent. Hence, this particular breach of contract by Cameron did <i>not</i>, in our view, preclude Cameron from claiming an indemnity from Stork for the latter\u2019s breach of contract in not conducting a proper dimensional inspection of the Riser Box. But this is not an end to the matter. Let us elaborate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the contractual obligation on the part of Stork to conduct a dimensional inspection of the Riser Box was not an absolute one. It only required Stork to perform this obligation with reasonable care. Such a contractual duty would of course be <i>coincident</i> with its duty of care in the <i>tortious</i> context. This is an important point because the fact that the concept of contributory negligence has <i>not</i> been introduced in the sphere of contract law <i>generally</i> is immaterial to the extent that the duty owed by Stork to Cameron was, as just stated, a <i>concurrent</i> one in contract and tort. The Singapore position in this regard is clear: the doctrine of <i>contributory negligence</i> is applicable where the defendant\u2019s liability in contract is the same as his or her liability in the tort of negligence independently of the existence of any contract (see the decision of this court in <i>Fong Maun Yee v Yoong Weng Ho Robert</i> <nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 297</nobr> (\u201c<i>Fong Maun Yee</i>\u201d), where the leading English decision in <i>Forsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta v Butcher</i> <nobr>[1989] AC 852</nobr> (\u201cthe <i>Vesta</i> case\u201d) was adopted and followed (the House of Lords did not, however, deal specifically with this particular point although the Court of Appeal and High Court did, with the Court of Appeal decision also being reported in the citation just given)). As an interesting aside, the Judge did in fact refer to both <i>Fong Maun Yee</i> and the <i>Vesta</i> case (see GD at [119]\u2013[121]), but this was in relation to the reliance by Cameron on the doctrine of contributory negligence with respect to its alleged liability to <i>the plaintiffs</i> (with whom it had, of course, a <i>contractual</i> relationship as well). Unfortunately, however, counsel concerned did <i>not</i> apply these cases to the issue of indemnity between <i>Cameron and Stork</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the <i>Vesta</i> case itself, Hobhouse\u00a0J (as he then was) helpfully set out (at first instance) the three categories which might arise in relation to the possible invocation of the defence of contributory negligence in contract, as follows (see <i>Forsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta v Butcher</i> [1986] 2\u00a0All\u00a0ER 488 at 508):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The question whether the 1945 Act [the UK Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, on which the Singapore Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap\u00a054, 2002\u00a0Ed) is in fact based] applies to claims brought in contract can arise in a number of classes of case. <i>Three categories</i> can conveniently be identified.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where the defendant\u2019s liability arises from some contractual provision which does not depend on negligence on the part of the defendant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where the defendant\u2019s liability arises from a contractual obligation which is expressed in terms of taking care (or its equivalent) but does not correspond to a common law duty to take care which would exist in the given case independently of contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where the defendant\u2019s liability in contract is the same as his liability in the tort of negligence independently of the existence of any contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">As already alluded to above, the House of Lords did not deal with the issue of contributory negligence as a defence in contract. However, both Hobhouse J (at first instance) and the Court of Appeal held (as we have also noted above) that the doctrine of contributory negligence was available as a defence in contract \u2013 but only in <i>category (3)</i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, as set out in the above quotation, which relates to a situation of <i>concurrent</i> liability in contract and tort.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Contributory negligence in contract \u2013 developments and devices</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the position in Singapore is (as we have already noted) presently that as set out in the <i>Vesta</i> case, the position with regard to the issue of contributory negligence in contract is still, however, in a state of development across many Commonwealth jurisdictions. A succinct account of developments across various jurisdictions may in fact be found in the UK Law Commission\u2019s Report entitled <i>Contributory Negligence as a Defence in Contract</i> (Law Com No\u00a0219, 1993) at paras\u00a02.7\u20132.19.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To take but a more specific sampling of various positions and developments in the sphere of the common law, the High Court of Australia held, in <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i> (1999) 161\u00a0ALR 155 (Callinan\u00a0J dissenting), that the defence of contributory negligence would not apply <i>even in</i> a situation of concurrent liability in contract and tort. This decision was not well received generally and it came as no surprise when various Australian state legislatures effected various amendments to the equivalent of the Singapore Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap\u00a054, 2002\u00a0Rev Ed) (see, for example, J\u00a0W\u00a0Carter &amp; D\u00a0J\u00a0Harland, <i>Contract Law in Australia</i> (Butterworths, 4th\u00a0Ed, 2002) at para\u00a02129 and N\u00a0C\u00a0Seddon &amp; M\u00a0P\u00a0Ellinghaus, <i>Cheshire &amp; Fifoot\u2019s Law of Contract</i> (LexisNexis Butterworths, 8th\u00a0Australian Ed, 2002) at para\u00a023.28). In contrast, the New Zealand position is the same as that which exists in Singapore and England: see the New Zealand High Court decision of <i>Rowe v Turner Hopkins &amp; Partners</i> <nobr>[1980] 2 NZLR 550</nobr> (reversed on appeal in <nobr>[1982] 1 NZLR 178</nobr>, but not on this point and where the New Zealand Court of Appeal left open for future consideration an even <i>broader</i> approach), which was in fact cited and applied in the <i>Vesta</i> case (though it might be noted that Cooke\u00a0P in the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision of <i>Mouat v Clark Boyce</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 NZLR 559</nobr> at 564 preferred the view that contributory negligence could apply in contract in its <i>widest sense</i> (which would encompass the first class of cases referred to in the <i>Vesta</i> case as well)). The position embodied in the <i>Vesta</i> case was in fact ultimately advocated by the UK Law Commission in their Report ([102] <i>supra</i>) and was in contrast to its earlier Working Paper (also entitled <i>Contributory Negligence as a Defence in Contract</i> (Working Paper No\u00a0114, 1990)) which advocated that contributory negligence be permitted as a defence in contract in its <i>widest</i> sense (see also <i>per</i> Cooke\u00a0P in <i>Mouat v Clark Boyce</i>). Indeed, the New Zealand Law Commission also proposed a similarly wide legislative reform (see <i>Apportionment of Civil Liability</i> (Report\u00a047, May 1998)).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also note that courts in other jurisdictions have sought to achieve the same effect as the introduction of contributory negligence in contract by resort to <i>other contractual devices</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One such device is that of \u201c<i>anticipatory mitigation</i>\u201d (see, for example, the oft-cited decision of Saunders\u00a0J in the Ontario High Court of Justice case of <i>Tompkins Hardware Ltd v North Western Flying Services Ltd</i> (1982) 139\u00a0DLR\u00a0(3d) 329 (\u201cthe <i>Tompkins Hardware</i> case\u201d), applied (most notably) in the (also oft-cited) Ontario High Court of Justice case of <i>Ribic v Weinstein</i> (1982) 140\u00a0DLR\u00a0(3d) 258 and described by Lacourci\u00e8re\u00a0JA, delivering the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Cosyns v Smith</i> (1983) 146\u00a0DLR\u00a0(3d) 622 at 628, as embodying an \u201cattractive conclusion\u201d). As Saunders\u00a0J put it in the <i>Tompkins Hardware</i> case (at 341), where the negligence of the plaintiff \u201ccreated the situation where the damage occurred\u201d, \u201cthere should \u2026 be apportionment whether the action be brought in contract or in tort\u201d. We do <i>not</i> think that the learned judge intended to impose a stringent condition to the effect that the plaintiff must be <i>wholly</i> responsible for the situation where the damage occurred and that his observation must be read in the light of the <i>actual facts</i> of the <i>Tompkins Hardware</i> case itself (see also the New Brunswick Court of Appeal decision of <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v H E Kane Agencies Ltd</i> (1985) 17\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 695 at 708 (reference to the plaintiff being the cause of his or her loss \u201cin part\u201d)). Nevertheless, this device of \u201canticipatory mitigation\u201d might run into another difficulty \u2013 that the concept of mitigation in the law of contract refers to a situation that occurs <i>after</i> the breach concerned (see also, for example, John Burrows, Jeremy Finn &amp; Stephen Todd, <i>Law of Contract in New Zealand</i> (LexisNexis, 2nd\u00a0Ed, 2002) at p\u00a0799). Notwithstanding the logical persuasiveness of this last-mentioned argument, we would not dismiss this device out of hand (which was in fact endorsed in S\u00a0M\u00a0Waddams, <i>The Law of Contracts</i> (Canada Law Book Inc, 4th\u00a0Ed, 1999) at para\u00a0773). It is, however, unnecessary for us to decide on this point in the light of our finding above that there is concurrent liability in contract and tort in the present proceedings and that the principle in <i>Fong Maun Yee</i> ([100] <i>supra</i>) applies. We therefore say no more about it in the context of the present proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another contractual device centres on the possible application of the principles of <i>remoteness of damage</i> that have their genesis in the seminal English Court of Exchequer decision of <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> (1854) 9\u00a0Exch 341; 156\u00a0ER 145. Indeed, most recently, the Singapore High Court decision of <i>CHS CPO GmbH v Vikas Goel</i> <nobr>[2005] 3 SLR 202</nobr> reaffirms the fact that the principles established in <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> continue to be the law in the Singapore context despite doubts expressed in the New Zealand context (see at [87], not following the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision of <i>McElroy Milne v Commercial Electronics Ltd</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 NZLR 39</nobr>). In so far as the present case is concerned, the argument would be to the effect that where the plaintiff has been guilty of contributory negligence, any damage caused as a result would be too remote as it would fall outside the scope of the first limb set out in <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>, which relates to \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d damage (and <i>cf</i> the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in <i>Doiron v Caisse Populaire d\u2019Inkerman Lt\u00e9e</i> (1985) 17\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 660 (\u201cthe <i>Doiron</i> case\u201d) at 680\u2013681 as well as the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Sayers v Harlow Urban District Council</i> <nobr>[1958] 1 WLR 623</nobr>, especially at 625). This, however, does raise a related issue as to whether or not such damage would also be too remote as it would <i>also</i> fall outside the <i>second</i> limb of <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> as well, which relates to \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cnon-natural\u201d damage (<i>cf</i> the <i>Doiron</i> case at 682). Here, <i>actual</i> knowledge must be brought home to the defendant in order that the damage might not be considered to be too remote. This is, generally speaking, also an interesting argument but, once again, it is unnecessary for us to decide on this point in the light of our finding above and we therefore also say no more about it in the context of the present proceedings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One further possible contractual device is to utilise the concept of the <i>implied term</i> to the effect that the plaintiff would exercise due care for his or her own interest (see Nick Seddon, \u201cContract Damages Where Both Parties Are at Fault\u201d (2000) 15\u00a0JCL 207 at 215\u2013216). Again, this is an argument that we need not deal with at the present time although it must be emphasised that a court will <i>not lightly</i> imply a term into a contract. There are of course two established categories of implied terms \u2013 \u201cterms implied in fact\u201d and \u201cterms implied in law\u201d, respectively. We have already dealt with the latter (and broader) category briefly above (see [89]\u2013[92]). In so far as the former category is concerned, the criteria, whilst different, are no less stringent. Indeed, there are two oft-cited tests in order to find \u201cterms implied in fact\u201d, which I have summarised in <i>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Private Ltd</i> ([89] <i>supra</i>), as follows (at [29]\u2013[32]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has always been acknowledged that particular terms might be implied into particular contracts. However, in order not to undermine the concept of freedom of contract itself, terms would be implied only rarely \u2013 in exceptional cases where, as one famous case put it, it was <i>necessary</i> to give \u201c<i>business efficacy</i>\u201d to the contract (see <i>per</i> Bowen\u00a0LJ (as then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision in <i>The Moorcock</i> (1889) 14\u00a0PD 64). In the words of Bowen\u00a0LJ himself (at 68):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Now, an implied warranty, or, as it is called, a covenant in law, as distinguished from an express contract or express warranty, really is in all cases founded on the presumed intention of the parties, and upon reason. The implication which the law draws from what must obviously have been the intention of the parties, the law draws with the object of giving efficacy to the transaction and preventing such a failure of consideration as cannot have been within the contemplation of either side; and I believe if one were to take all the cases, and there are many, of implied warranties or covenants in law, it will be found that in all of them the law is raising an implication from the presumed intention of the parties with the object of giving to the transaction such efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it should have. In business transactions such as this, what the law desires to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who are business men; not to impose on one side all the perils of the transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure, but to make each party promise in law as much, at all events, as it must have been in the contemplation of both parties that he should be responsible for in respect of those perils or chances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, Lord\u00a0Esher\u00a0MR adopted a similar approach, although it is Bowen\u00a0LJ\u2019s judgment that is most often cited. This is probably due to the fact that a close perusal of Lord\u00a0Esher\u00a0MR\u2019s judgment will reveal that the learned Master of the Rolls did not <i>explicitly</i> adopt the \u201cbusiness efficacy\u201d test as such. It might be usefully observed at this juncture that the third judge, Fry\u00a0LJ, agreed with both Bowen\u00a0LJ and Lord\u00a0Esher\u00a0MR (see [29] <i>supra</i> at 71).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was another test, which soon became equally famous. It was by MacKinnon\u00a0LJ in another English Court of Appeal decision. This was the famous \u201c<i>officious bystander</i>\u201d test which was propounded in <i>Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Limited</i> <nobr>[1939] 2 KB 206</nobr> at 227 (\u201c<i>Shirlaw</i>\u201d) (affirmed, <nobr>[1940] AC 701</nobr>), as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If I may quote from an essay which I wrote some years ago, I then said: \u201cPrima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common \u2018Oh, of course!\u2019\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">At least it is true, I think, that, if a term were never implied by a judge unless it could pass that test, he could not be held to be wrong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Interestingly, the essay referred to above was in fact a public lecture delivered at the London School of Economics in the University of London: see Sir\u00a0Frank MacKinnon, <i>Some Aspects of Commercial Law \u2013 A Lecture Delivered at the London School of Economics on 3\u00a0March 1926</i> (Oxford University Press, 1926) (and see, especially, p\u00a013).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both these tests are firmly established in the local case law (in addition to the cases cited below, see also, for example, <i>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Batshita International (Pte) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 741</nobr> at 745\u2013746, [13]\u2013[15] (affirmed in <i>Batshita International (Pte) Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 241</nobr>) and <i>Chai Chung Ching Chester v Diversey (Far East) Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1991] SLR 769</nobr> at 778, [34] (affirmed in <i>Diversey (Far East) Pte Ltd v Chai Chung Ching Chester</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 535</nobr>), with regard to the \u201cbusiness efficacy\u201d and \u201cofficious bystander\u201d tests, respectively.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yet another (even more fundamental) device is simply to argue that the breach of contract did <i>not cause</i> the damage concerned (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Quinn v Burch Bros (Builders) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1966] 2 QB 370</nobr>). Indeed, where it can be established that a <i>novus actus interveniens</i> has broken the chain of causation, the defendant will be freed from liability (see, for example, the (also) English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Beoco Ltd v Alfa Laval Co Ltd</i> <nobr>[1995] QB 137</nobr>). It should be noted, however, that this device almost invariably results in an \u201call or nothing\u201d result (though <i>cf</i> the English Court of Appeal in <i>Tennant Radiant Heat Ltd v Warrington Development Corporation</i> <nobr>[1988] 1 EGLR 41</nobr>, which was endorsed in English High Court decision of <i>W\u00a0Lamb Ltd v J\u00a0Jarvis &amp; Sons plc</i> (1998) 60\u00a0Con\u00a0LR 1; though <i>cf</i>, in turn, the <i>obiter</i> observations by the (also) English Court of Appeal in <i>Bank of Nova Scotia v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association (Bermuda) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1990] 1 QB 818</nobr> at 904). However, we find that this particular device is not applicable on the facts of the present proceedings and therefore say no more about it here.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rationale of fairness has been a powerful underlying legal impetus for the various attempts to introduce the doctrine in contract (or devices that would, in substance, achieve the same result). For example, La Forest\u00a0JA (as he then was), delivering the judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in the <i>Doiron</i> case, observed thus ([106] <i>supra</i> at 673):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">What the \u2026 authorities demonstrate to me is that the doctrine of apportionment of loss where contributory negligence arises in contract cases is here to stay. There are strong underlying policy reasons favouring this approach and the courts, using one technical device or another, will, I venture to think, continue to respond to these by applying the doctrine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having determined that the equivalent of our Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act did not apply to a situation involving a breach of contract, the learned judge was nevertheless of the view (at 677) that \u201cthere does not seem to be any inherent requirement in contract law dictating an absolutist doctrine of liability\u201d. La Forest\u00a0JA was of the view (at 679) that \u201c[a]s 19th century judges responded to the ethos of their times, so must we to ours\u201d and that \u201c[c]ontribution is now consistent with prevailing theories of both the law and the market-place\u201d; he then added, simply albeit significantly, thus (see <i>ibid</i>): \u201cAnd it meets our sense of fairness.\u201d While not advocating contribution as a mandatory rule as such, the learned judge appeared ultimately to adopt a test akin to the remoteness test in <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> (see [106] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 La Forest\u00a0JA also referred to the concept of legitimate expectations (at 682). This concept has in fact been endorsed in the Singapore context, in the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <i>Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</i> <nobr>[2000] 3 SLR 405</nobr>, for example, Yong Pung How\u00a0CJ observed in no uncertain terms (at [40]) that \u201cthe function of the court is to try as far as practical experience allows, to ensure that the reasonable expectations of honest men are not disappointed\u201d (see also the extrajudicial lecture by Lord Steyn, \u201cContract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men\u201d (1997) 113\u00a0LQR 433). However, whilst the concept of reasonable expectations is an important one, it has not, at this point in time at least, attained the status of a substantive legal doctrine in and of itself. In this regard, therefore, any argument in favour of contributory negligence in contract must be premised, in our view, on established and substantive doctrines such as those referred to above.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in the New Brunswick Court of Appeal decision of <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v H E Kane Agencies Ltd</i> ([105] <i>supra</i>), Stratton\u00a0JA, who delivered the judgment of the court, adopted an extremely broad, albeit (with respect) vague, approach as follows (at 708):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Whether one accepts the argument that at common law damages could be apportioned in actions in contract as well as in actions of tort and that the <i>Contributory Negligence Act</i> \u2026 should be applied by analogy, or adopts the theory of the reasonable expectations of the parties, or the notion of reliance that was either qualified or unreasonable, <i>or simply that in fairness and to do justice</i> the damages ought to be apportioned, I do not think that in the circumstances of this case the trial judge erred in concluding that the actions of the company president, Harold Kane, and of Charles Kane, its employee, contributed to the company\u2019s loss. Nor am I able to say that the apportionment of the degrees of fault of each party is wrong. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, developments in other jurisdictions are instructive and relevant inasmuch as they give legal food for thought in so far as development of the law in the Singapore context along the lines of legislation and/or case law are concerned. But there is no need to explore \u2013 let alone invoke \u2013 them in the present proceedings as the position in <i>Singapore</i>, as we have noted, is clear at the present time. It follows that established in the <i>Vesta</i> case (and see generally [100] above). And it is to the <i>application</i> of those principles to the facts of the present proceedings that our attention must now turn. We note, however, that in situations where (unlike the present) there is <i>no concurrent</i> liability in tort and contract, the invocation of one or more of the devices just mentioned may be important in order to ensure that justice and fairness is achieved if the Singapore legislature does not amend the law in the meantime. We should hasten to add that by utilising the terminology of \u201cdevices\u201d, we do not intend to imply any pejorative meaning. After all, these are perfectly valid legal doctrines in their own right, although they are not conventionally invoked (hence, the terminology utilised).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Our decision in the present proceedings</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Returning to the facts of the present case, the issue that arises (given the present legal position in the Singapore context as established in this court\u2019s decision in <i>Fong Maun Yee</i> ([100] <i>supra</i>)) is whether or not there was contributory negligence on the part of Cameron, given our finding above that Stork owed Cameron <i>concurrent</i> duties in <i>both</i> contract <i>and</i> tort. We have already noted that Cameron had not furnished Stork with the requisite dimensional drawings. We have also held that this was in fact a breach of an implied term (in law) by Cameron. In so far as the issue of contributory negligence is concerned, we do not even need to go so far. Indeed, the existence of a legal duty is not necessary for the purposes of establishing contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. For example, in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Lewis v Denye</i> <nobr>[1939] 1 KB 540</nobr>, du Parcq\u00a0LJ observed thus (at 554\u2013555):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In order to establish the defence of contributory negligence, the defendant must prove, first, that the plaintiff failed to take \u201cordinary care for himself,\u201d or, in other words, such care as a reasonable man would take for his own safety, and, secondly, that his failure to take care was a contributory cause of the accident. The doctrine of contributory negligence \u201ccannot be based upon a breach of duty to the negligent defendant.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, in the (also) English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) Ld</i> <nobr>[1949] 2 KB 291</nobr>, Denning\u00a0LJ (as he then was) observed as follows (at 324\u2013325):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">When a man steps into the road he owes a duty to himself to take care for his own safety, but he does not owe any duty to a motorist who is going at an excessive speed to avoid being run down. Nevertheless, if he does not keep a good lookout, he is guilty of contributory negligence. <i>The real question is not whether the plaintiff was neglecting some legal duty, but whether he was acting as a reasonable man and with reasonable care.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the failure by Cameron to furnish Stork with the requisite dimensional drawings did, having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances, in fact constitute <i>contributory negligence</i>. In this regard, the following observations in the following article by Ariel Porat, \u201cContributory Negligence in Contract Law: Toward a Principled Approach\u201d (1994) 28\u00a0UBC\u00a0L\u00a0Rev 141 at 153 might also be usefully noted:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Lack of information essential to contract performance is sometimes liable to result in a breach. If the aggrieved party possesses such information but fails to convey it to the party in breach, even knowing it to be essential to performance, it might be appropriate to reduce damages to the aggrieved party on account of contributory negligence. In extreme cases, when non-disclosure is either deliberate or fraudulent, the conduct of the aggrieved party should be viewed as justifying the full exoneration of the party in breach.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst there was no fraud or similar conduct on the part of Cameron, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, we find that there was contributory negligence on the part of Cameron to the extent of 50%.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this juncture, we need to clarify the amounts payable by both Cameron and Stork and, to this extent, the respective amounts awarded by the court below will need to be modified accordingly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It will be recalled that the Judge had held that</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Cameron and Stork were equally liable to the plaintiffs, and therefore ordered Stork to indemnify Cameron for 50% of the total damages. In other words, Stork was liable to indemnify Cameron in the sum of US$500,000 for the total amount of US$1m awarded to the plaintiffs with respect to the loss of the BOP stack, leaving aside the nominal damages payable in respect of the other pleaded heads of damage. With respect, we note that there has been some confusion inasmuch as there has been some (unintentional) conflation of two separate and distinct issues.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first concerns Cameron\u2019s and Stork\u2019s respective liability to the plaintiffs. Here, the Judge held that the former parties were equally liable to the latter. This would mean, in so far as the BOP stack was concerned, that, notwithstanding Cameron\u2019s <i>prima facie</i> liability for the full sum of US$1m awarded with regard to this particular item, Stork ought to share in that liability as well (to the extent of 50%). In other words, Cameron and Stork were liable in the sum of US$500,000 each <i>to the plaintiffs</i> (a holding which we endorse). Looked at in this light, the concept of \u201cindemnity\u201d as utilised by the Judge was, with the greatest of respect, liable to lead to some confusion inasmuch as it suggested that the concept applied to the relationship between <i>Cameron and Stork</i>. We do not in fact think that the Judge intended the concept to be utilised in that fashion. She was, in our view, utilising the concept of \u201cindemnity\u201d in a <i>broader</i> sense in so far as it referred to the respective liability of Cameron and Stork <i>to the plaintiffs</i>. Perhaps the more appropriate concept to utilise would be that of \u201ccontribution\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conceptual distinction between contribution and indemnity, in its true form, was discussed in <i>Driver v William Willett (Contractors) Ltd</i> [1969] 1\u00a0</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">All\u00a0ER 665, a case that was cited by Cameron. In that case, an employer and its consultants were found to be jointly liable for injury caused to an employee. The court found that the employer and the consultants were respectively liable to the employee for 40% and 60% of his loss respectively. The court then went on to consider whether the employer was entitled to recover its 40% liability to the employee as damages for breach of contract from the consultants. Rees\u00a0J clearly drew a distinction between apportionment and indemnity, opining (at 674):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 I apprehend that the question which I have to answer is as to whether the evidence established that the damage suffered by <i>the employers</i> as a result of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was caused by the consultants\u2019 breach of contract. The apportionment of responsibility for the accident as between tortfeasors, both held to be liable to an injured plaintiff, involves considerations of causative potency as well as blameworthiness.</span> <i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It does not necessarily decide the issue of damages for breach of a contract as between the two tortfeasors</span></i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">.</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding the Judge\u2019s determination that Stork was liable for 50% of the plaintiffs\u2019 losses, there remained the issue of how the concept of \u201cindemnity\u201d applies (in its <i>narrower</i> sense) to <i>the specific legal relationship between Cameron and Stork</i> (and which we alluded to briefly at the outset of this part of our judgment). In other words, would (as was in fact claimed by counsel for Cameron) Cameron be entitled to claim a <i>full</i> indemnity for US$500,000 <i>from Stork</i> on the basis that <i>Stork had breached its contractual obligations to Cameron</i>? If so, then Cameron would not have to pay any damages at all since <i>Stork</i> would then <i>wholly</i> bear the legal responsibility in so far as the amount of US$1m awarded to the plaintiffs with regard to the BOP stack was concerned. Given our finding that Stork had indeed breached its contractual duty to conduct a dimensional inspection of the Riser Box, this would appear to be the result at first blush. <i>However</i>, having regard to our finding of <i>contributory negligence</i> <i>in so far as the contract between Cameron and Stork is concerned (to the extent of 50%)</i>, we are of the view that Cameron is <i>not</i> entitled to a <i>full</i> indemnity from Stork. We therefore allow Cameron\u2019s appeal in part only on this particular issue, and order Stork to indemnify Cameron in the sum of US$250,000 instead. To the extent that <i>Stork</i> is <i>itself</i> liable for 50% of the damages of US$1m payable <i>to the plaintiffs</i> (<i>viz</i>, US$500,000), it would, <i>in toto</i>, have to indemnify (and we note, here, that the concept of indemnity is used in a very <i>general</i> sense, and not as a term of art) Cameron <i>in the (total) sum of US$750,000</i>. Perhaps the more <i>accurate</i> manner of putting it would be to state that Stork is liable to contribute US$500,000 to Cameron for its part in the damage caused <i>to the plaintiffs</i> <i>and</i> is also liable to indemnify Cameron in the sum of US$250,000 for breaching its contractual obligation which it owed to Cameron. If, of course, we had found no contributory negligence on the part of Cameron, then Stork would have had to indemnify Cameron in the sum of US$500,000. In other words, Cameron would not, in the final analysis, have been liable to pay any damages at all with regard to the loss of the BOP stack as Stork would have had to bear Cameron\u2019s share of the liability in this regard as well since it had breached its contractual obligation to Cameron. In the circumstances, however, we <i>did</i> in fact find that there had been contributory negligence on the part of Cameron. We reiterate that the doctrine of contributory negligence was applicable to the <i>contractual</i> relationship between Cameron and Stork simply because Stork owed <i>concurrent</i> duties in both contract <i>and</i> tort to Cameron. As we have observed, there might well be a case for <i>broadening</i> the law in this area by allowing contributory negligence to apply even where the duties in contract and tort are not identical. Of course, the <i>broadest</i> application would be to allow this doctrine to apply even where there is a <i>strict</i> <i>contractual</i> duty <i>only</i> (<i>ie</i>, a <i>category (1)</i> case as described at [101] above). That said, as we have also briefly alluded to above, there are <i>other contractual devices</i> that might serve as <i>possible alternatives</i> to the doctrine of contributory negligence. However, it is <i>unnecessary</i> to consider any of these broader applications and/or contractual devices in the present case. We would simply apply the previous decision of this court in <i>Fong Maun Yee</i> ([100] <i>supra</i>), which held that the doctrine of contributory negligence applies in a contractual context where the defendant owes the plaintiff <i>concurrent</i> duties in contract <i>and</i> tort.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we reiterate the need to distinguish clearly amongst the various legal relationships concerned. In particular, the respective liability of the defendants to the plaintiffs is (as we have endeavoured to point out) quite different from that between the defendants themselves. This latter relationship is contractual in nature and it would, in our view, conduce towards clarity if the concept of \u201cindemnity\u201d is confined to this particular relationship. We observe that counsel concerned could have been more helpful to the Judge in this regard as this would have avoided the slight legal wrinkle which we have now had to iron out. We turn now to consider the other issues arising in the instant case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Other issues</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to the remaining issues. They can be dealt with briefly. They were not the focus of counsel\u2019s argument on appeal. More importantly, we are in full agreement with the reasoning of the Judge with regard to these issues. Indeed, she dealt with them in a comprehensive and (if we may say so) admirable fashion. In our view, when justice has therefore been achieved at first instance in accordance with the relevant legal rules and principles, words from the appellate court ought, from the perspectives of logic, common sense and fairness, to be few.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Identity of the fractured slip joint</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">125<b><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i></b> The issue of the identity of the fractured slip joint was, in our view, a question of fact for the Judge and, based on existing legal principles well known to all concerned and which permit an appellate court to interfere with the findings of fact by a trial judge in limited circumstances only, we find no reason to interfere with her findings of fact. We found her analysis to be both thorough and persuasive and therefore do not find it necessary to add anything to it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Title to sue</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">126<b><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i></b> We also find the Judge\u2019s analysis and findings on the issue of title to sue with respect (in particular) to both JDL and MEP to be both cogent and fair, and have nothing to add.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The legal liability of Cameron to the plaintiffs</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The legal liability of Cameron to the plaintiffs was premised on contract as well as tort.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning briefly to arguments in the contractual sphere, we find the Judge\u2019s holding to the effect that Cameron had been in breach of the implied terms to utilise skill and care to be justified by the facts as well as the context of the case. We would only add that although the Judge appeared to characterise these implied terms as \u201cterms implied in fact\u201d, there was no reason in principle why the learned judge could not have characterised them as \u201cterms implied in law\u201d instead (see also generally the analysis at [89]\u2013[92] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as liability in tort was concerned, the Judge, correctly in our view, characterised the duty of care as being co-extensive with that which existed in contract. We also note that the learned judge had utilised the three-part test enunciated by the House of Lords in <i>Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman</i> <nobr>[1990] 2 AC 605.</nobr> This particular test is well established and has been applied in the Singapore context (see, for example, the Singapore Court of Appeal decisions of <i>Ikumene Singapore Pte Ltd v Leong Chee Leng</i> <nobr>[1993] 3 SLR 24</nobr>; <i>Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 505</nobr>; <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers v MCST Plan No\u00a01075</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 449</nobr>; and <i>United Project Consultants Pte Ltd v Leong Kwok Onn</i> <nobr>[2005] 4 SLR 214</nobr>). The law relating to the tortious duty of care in the context of recovery for pure economic loss is, however, a confused and confusing one. On a positive note, however, it is also gradually evolving and the legal position is by no means the same in all Commonwealth jurisdictions. It may well be the case that Singapore law might need to be refined at some future point in time in order to integrate the best from these other cases. This would ensure that there is rich legal soil from which the fruit of justice and fairness can emerge. However, this is not an appropriate occasion. Whichever test is adopted, it is clear, on the facts, that Cameron owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs and had breached it. The Judge\u2019s analysis and reasoning in this regard was thorough and persuasive and we have nothing useful to add. Indeed, it might even be argued that the present proceedings involved a straightforward situation of physical damage involving an equally straightforward application of the principles laid down in the seminal House of Lords decision of <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i> <nobr>[1932] AC 562.</nobr> However, we need not even go so far for, as we have already noted, even applying the narrower test with regard to the tortious duty of care in the context of recovery for pure economic loss, we would also hold that Cameron was indeed liable to the plaintiffs for the breach of a duty of care.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also agree with the Judge that the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, that the certificate of compliance (\u201cCOC\u201d) dated 23\u00a0December 1998 was itself a warranty, ought to be rejected, having regard to the circumstances of the case (see GD at [64]). Indeed, the context clearly demonstrates that there had been no intention to create legal relations and there was, therefore, no contractual relationship established in the first instance. We also note that the Judge considered whether or not the statements in the COC constituted negligent misstatements instead under the principle first enunciated in the seminal House of Lords decision of <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> <nobr>[1964] AC 465.</nobr> In this last-mentioned regard, we agree with her application of the law to the facts in the present proceedings (in particular, her holding that no reliance on the COC had been proved, the element of reliance being of course a crucial element in this particular sphere of the law of negligence).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The legal liability of Stork to the plaintiffs</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We agree with the findings of the Judge on the issue of the legal liability of Stork to the plaintiffs. It was clear that Stork was indeed in breach of a duty of care owed to the plaintiffs. We have nothing useful to add to the analysis and findings of the Judge in this particular regard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Exception clauses</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge held that Cameron could not rely upon the exception clauses concerned <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the plaintiffs. In particular, she held that these clauses had not been incorporated into the contract in question and that, in any event, the clauses themselves did not cover the situation that was the subject of the present proceedings. We agree with the Judge\u2019s analysis and reasons and have nothing useful to add, save to state that there was some suggestion that there might have been a possible course of dealings (see GD at [112]). However, this point was not pursued by Cameron. Not surprisingly, there is in fact no evidence in this particular regard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>The doctrine of</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">novus actus interveniens</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">133<b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> The reliance by Cameron on an alleged <i>novus actus interveniens</i> on the part of the plaintiffs is, in our view, without merit. In particular, Cameron alleged a failure on the part of the plaintiffs (principally, on the part of JHL and JSL) to properly inspect or maintain the Standby Slip Joint as well as to properly inspect the said slip joint prior to using it on 16\u00a0March 2001. However, we agree with the Judge that the plaintiffs were entitled to assume that Cameron had fulfilled its contractual obligations owed to them without having to carry out any inspections or maintenance. It seems to us that this is not only just and fair but also commonsensical. In any event, Cameron had not furnished the plaintiffs with the requisite drawings that would have enabled them to carry out inspections or maintenance, even assuming that there was a duty on the plaintiffs to do so in the first instance. Further, the essence of a <i>novus actus interveniens</i> required an act on the part of the plaintiffs whose nature was sufficient to break the chain of causation. We agree with the Judge that the alleged act (or omission, rather) fell short of constituting a <i>novus actus interveniens</i> on the part of the plaintiffs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>The doctrine of contributory negligence</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cameron also relied on the doctrine of contributory negligence with respect to its alleged liability to the plaintiffs. Although, as we have noted (at [114] and [115]), the existence of a legal duty is not necessary for the purposes of establishing contributory negligence, we are of the view that the plaintiffs were not guilty of not taking the requisite care. Indeed, as we have alluded to in the preceding paragraph, a reasonable person in the shoes of the plaintiffs would have assumed that Cameron would fulfil its contractual obligations without any further action on their (the plaintiffs\u2019) part.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">135\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we have already mentioned, the Judge dealt with the issues in the court below in a comprehensive and fair manner.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We differ somewhat in the reasoning with regard to two issues only. Of those two issues, we would modify the Judge\u2019s decision in part only with respect to one of them. In summary, in so far as the first issue is concerned, whilst we agree with the Judge that the documents in the Damages Bundle could not be admitted, we hold (in so far as the threshold issue with respect to the very introduction of the Documents is concerned) that this holding is based not so much on the fact (as the Judge found) that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that they had satisfied a positive burden placed on them to comply with the requisite provisions of the Evidence Act <i>per se</i> but, rather, because the defendants had in fact objected to the introduction of the Documents. At <i>that</i> point, the plaintiffs were <i>then</i> under a legal obligation to in fact satisfy the requisite provisions of the Evidence Act, which they did <i>not</i>. In addition (and here we agree with the holding of the Judge), <i>in any event</i>, the plaintiffs did <i>not</i> meet the legal hurdles posed by the doctrine of hearsay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">137\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the second issue is concerned, we agree with the Judge that both Cameron and Stork were <i>equally</i> liable to <i>the plaintiffs</i>. Where we differ, with respect, from her decision is the fact that insufficient consideration was given (in so far as the issue of an <i>indemnity</i> was concerned) to <i>the legal relationship</i> <i>between Cameron and Stork</i>. In the event, we hold that Stork was liable to indemnify Cameron in the sum of US$250,000 for breach of its contractual obligations which it owed to Cameron (in addition to its liability to pay the plaintiffs US$500,000 for the breach of the duty of care which it owed to them).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">138\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Returning to the dearth of argument in the court below, unfortunately, in an adversarial system, much depends upon the efforts of counsel concerned. Nevertheless, we ought, in fairness, point out that this last-mentioned issue has not been actively canvassed in the case law as well as textbooks and is, to that extent, a subtle one. However, we trust that it will be neither subtle nor esoteric after the clarification in the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">139\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances, we allow Cameron\u2019s appeal with regard to the issue of the indemnity claimed under its contract with Stork in part. In other words, in so far as the BOP stack is concerned, Stork is liable to indemnify Cameron in the sum of US$250,000. In addition, Stork remains liable in the sum of US$500,000, which represents its own liability to the plaintiffs with respect to this particular item and, to that extent, must contribute to any damages payable by Cameron to the plaintiffs to that extent. In all other respects, however, we affirm the decision of the Judge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">140\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the issue of costs is concerned, we find nothing wrong with the decision of the Judge (as set out in the costs judgment). However, in the light of our specific finding on the issue of indemnity as set out in the preceding paragraph, we would modify the Judge\u2019s order as to costs inasmuch as Cameron should be awarded half of its costs of the third party proceedings. In addition, Stork should indemnify Cameron to the extent of 25% of the costs (including disbursements) payable to the plaintiffs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">141\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the present proceedings are concerned, the plaintiffs are to pay the costs of the defendants in Civil Appeals Nos\u00a096 and 122 of 2005. The first defendant (Cameron) is to bear 25% of the costs of the plaintiffs and the second defendant (Stork) is to bear 75% of the costs of the plaintiffs in Civil Appeals Nos\u00a097, 98, 128 and 129 of 2005.

The respondents opened their first retail outlet with that name on 6 April 1997 at The Heeren, an upmarket shopping centre along Orchard Road. By the time of the trial, the respondents had opened a total of seven such outlets at various shopping centres all over the island, of which one was a franchised outlet. An important characteristic of the respondents` outlets is that all the goods sold in the outlets, ranging from Japanese snacks and other foodstuffs to cosmetics, fashion accessories, stationery, toiletries, common household products, plastic-ware and toys, are priced at a fixed price of $1.99.<br/><br/>The person behind the respondents is one Ms Nanz Chong, the Managing Director. She is a relatively well-known former-model-turned-entrepreneur. According to her, she first conceived the idea of a `one-price store` following her travel to Japan in the mid-nineties in the course of her work as a model when she noticed numerous stores there selling all items at one fixed price. She felt that this kind of a sales concept would catch on and be popular in Singapore. So for three years preceding the opening of the first store, she put in considerable effort sourcing for goods and preparing for the opening. The logo she chose for the shop consisted of the words `ONE.shop` written in black against a stark white background with the numbers `99` appearing in a larger, bold red-coloured font over the word `shop`.<br/><br/>Following the opening of the first ONE.99 outlet at The Hereen, the shop received immense publicity in the media, both in terms of news reports as well as feature articles. It seems to us clear that to a large extent this was due to Ms Chong`s own earlier fame as a fashion model. Another reason was obviously due  to the fact that the articles sold at the shop were at a relatively cheap price of $1.99[cent ]. A bargain shop like this at an upmarket location was obviously something the public would be curious about. The shop was variously referred to by the media as the `$1.99 Shop`, the `1.99 Shop` and the `$1.99 Store` .<br/><br/>Ms Chong attributed the success of the shop to two factors: pricing policy and good service by her staff. `Service with a smile` is the respondents` hallmark and the respondents sought to drive home the point that you can obtain good quality goods at an upmarket location without paying for the sky.<br/><br/>From the volume of business done, it was clear that the venture was a success. During the first 11 months of business, from April 1997 to February 1998, the sales turnover amounted to slightly more than $3.5m. In the year ending February 1999, the turnover almost doubled to $6.9m. For advertising in 1997, they spent $23,000 while it was $29,000 for 1998. Although in absolute terms these advertising figures are not very large, they are no doubt significant when one bears in mind that we are here concerned with goods priced at only $1.99.<br/><br/>Turning to the appellants, they were incorporated on 8 September 1998. They are almost a wholly owned subsidiary of Rubber Band Enterprises Pte Ltd (`Rubber Band`), as only 1% of the shares are owned by another party. Rubber Band was itself incorporated in 1992 and has a paid-up capital of $4m. It is a major player in the toy industry, being the licensee or agent for various popular overseas brands of toys including Disney from America, and Sanrio, a toy and gift company from Japan.<br/><br/>In September 1997, Rubber Band started selling Sanrio products at various department stores at $1.99. This move was prompted by the sales strategy of a competitor who was then selling a certain range of Sanrio products at a standard price of $2. To match that, they decided to go for the price of $1.99 and had appointed a manufacturer in Hong Kong to supply them that range of products. According to the appellants, three factors contributed to their choosing the price of $1.99. First, it was then very much the market norm to retail goods at prices ending with 99[cent ] such as $1.99, $2.99 or $9.99. In the case of the Sanrio products in question, $1.99 was the most appropriate price after taking costs and profit margins into account. Secondly, `99` is auspicious because it can be translated to mean `everlasting` or `perpetuity` in Mandarin. Thirdly, the price $1.99 was more competitive than $2, which was the retail price adopted by the appellants` competitor. At the time `100 Yen` shops were very popular in Japan and Rubber Band was encouraged by that.<br/><br/>In 1998, Rubber Band adopted another strategy of holding joint promotional sales of products at $1.99 with the Watson`s retail chain. Between February and October 1998, more than 40 such joint promotions were held at various Watson`s outlets, raking in a total of more than $1m in sales. With the success of the Watson`s promotions, Rubber Band was subsequently approached by major department stores to hold similar `$1.99` sales promotions. Thus a joint promotion was held at Takashimaya`s `Talking Hall` from 31 July to 19 August 1998 and the sales generated came up to some $150,000. Joint promotions were also held with Daimaru, at both Junction 8 and Liang Court Shopping Centres locations. At the sites of these promotions, various posters and placards contained the figure  `$1.99`, preceded by a clasped hand with its index finger pointing upwards. At the opposite end were several Japanese characters written vertically, which when translated meant `this is good`.<br/><br/>While promotional sales were successful, because of the low profit margin for retailers, few of them were willing to enter into long-term partnership with Rubber Band. Thus Rubber Band felt it could no longer just concentrate on distribution and wholesale. There was a need for it to actually go into retail. Furthermore, the continued holding of such ad hoc promotional sales with others posed a severe strain on its limited manpower. The appellants were, therefore, incorporated to function as the retail arm of Rubber Band. They decided to start with the $1.99 retail concept as it was something they had been doing with the various department stores since 1997, and for which they had ready products and suppliers.<br/><br/>The appellants also explained why their name bears the word `Lifestyle`. They said that from February 1997 Rubber Band had used the slogan `A leading <strong><i> Lifestyle </i></strong> creator` on posters to promote the toys and household products which they distributed. A director of Rubber Band, one Mr Ong Choon Seng, who coined the slogan, felt that since toys, household items and gifts would always be a part of our lifestyle, by bringing these products into the lives of Singaporeans, Rubber Band was thereby `creating a lifestyle`. As such, it was thought desirable to have the word `lifestyle` as part of the subsidiary`s name in order to give the subsidiary a common identity with the parent company. As it was also important that the name of the new company should be reflective and descriptive of the business of selling products at a fixed price of $1.99, the appellants` retail outlets were and are therefore called `Lifestyle 1.99`. The appellants said the `$` sign was omitted from the name as just `Lifestyle 1.99` was easier to pronounce. The clasped hand with the index finger pointing up was similarly discarded in favour of a simpler new logo which consisted of the word `<strong><i> Lifestyle </i></strong>` above the number `1.99`, all of which were printed in a distinctive white-coloured font against an oval-shaped cyan-coloured background.<br/><br/>However, not all the goods sold at each `Lifestyle 1.99` outlet were priced at $1.99. This was because in each outlet, there were `Premium Counters` where products were sold at prices other than $1.99, such as $3.99, $4.99 and the like. These premium products were generally products distributed by Rubber Band to other retailers but they cost more than $1.99. As a concession to the customers of `Lifestyle 1.99`, these products were offered to them at highly discounted prices. The appellants said that the number of `premium items` for sale in any outlet was highly insignificant when compared with the number of `$1.99` items and none of the premium items cost more than $10.<br/><br/>On or about 18 February 1999, the respondents` solicitors, M/s Drew &amp; Napier, sent a letter to the appellants stating that the respondents had acquired goodwill in the name `ONE.99` and demanded that the appellants cease the use of the name `Lifestyle 1.99`, as the latter is confusingly similar to the name `ONE.99`. The appellants did not comply. Thus the institution of this action by the respondents.<br/><br/><strong><i> The decision below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the hearing below, the learned judge granted an order restraining, inter alia, the appellants from passing off their business as and for the business of the respondents, and from misleading the public into thinking that the appellants were in some way connected or associated with the respondents.<br/><br/>The learned judge found that the name `ONE.99` is a fanciful one as it is pronounced as `One Point Nine Nine`, which has nothing to do with the price of the products sold at $1.99. He further found that in the light of the wide extent of media publicity concerning the ONE.99 Shop and the large sales turnover for the period of over one and a half years (until the incorporation of the appellants), the respondents had demonstrated that they had acquired goodwill in the name `ONE.99` and its variants `1.99 Shop` and `$1.99 Store`. He felt that part of the respondents` goodwill came from a combination of factors, namely, selling quality products at the fixed price of $1.99 in a trendy and upmarket setting. In his view, there must inevitably be confusion if both shops were referred to as the `One Point Nine Nine Shop`. He felt that the prefix `Lifestyle` to the appellants` outlets made no difference as the appeal of the name lay in `One Point Nine Nine`. The learned judge further thought that the appellants` choice of `1.99` as part of their name was influenced in part by the success of the respondents` ONE.99 shops.<br/><br/>On the question of damage, the learned judge found that there was sufficient evidence to show that many of Ms Chong`s customers had mistaken the appellants` shop for hers. A survey conducted by Asia Market Intelligence (S) Pte Ltd showed that 48% of the 300 persons sampled thought that `ONE.99` and `Lifestyle 1.99` were connected or associated with each other. While the learned judge recognised that evidence of confusion is not necessarily evidence of damage he held that `in the circumstances of this case ... there were, in all probability, instances of diversion of business, borne from confusion, and that, is clearly damage.`<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It is trite law that for a plaintiff to succeed in an action for passing-off three elements must be proved: (i) goodwill in a business, (ii) misrepresentation, namely, passing off one`s goods or services as the goods or services of another, and (iii) damage: see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc &amp; Ors</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1990] 1 All ER 873</font> per Lord Oliver at 880. The issues raised in this appeal touch on all three elements and they are:   </p>\n    <p>(a) whether the respondents had by 9 September 1998, the date on which the appellants commenced trading, acquired sufficient goodwill in their business in association with the use of the name `ONE.99`; </p>\n    <p>(b) whether the use by the appellants of the name `Lifestyle 1.99` was a misrepresentation to the public that they were in some way connected with the respondents or their business; and </p>\n    <p>(c) whether as a result, damage had been caused to the respondents.<br/><br/><strong><i> Goodwill </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>What is goodwill? We can do no better than cite the oft-quoted passage of Lord Macnaghten in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>IRC v Muller &amp; Co`s Margarine Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1901]  AC 217 at 223</font>-224:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Ordinarily goodwill is acquired by trading. It is inseparable from the business to which the goodwill relates. Again in the words of Lord Macnaughten at p 223:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Goodwill has no independent existence. It cannot subsist by itself. It must be attached to a business. Destroy the business and the goodwill perishes with it though elements remain, which may perhaps be gathered up and be revived again.`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>There is common ground between the parties that the respondents must show they had acquired goodwill on the date on which the first `Lifestyle 1.99` shop opened for business, namely, 9 September 1998 (the relevant date). On this issue, the appellants` bone of contention is that the learned judge did not correctly appreciate the term `goodwill` as he used the expression `goodwill in the name` throughout his judgment. The appellants submitted that this is a serious error as it wrongly assumes that the cause of action is based on the protection of a name. To substantiate this criticism, counsel for the appellants cited <strong><i> Wadlow on the Law of Passing Off </i></strong> (at p 45):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The right of property protected by the action for passing-off is the goodwill of the plaintiff`s business as a whole. Passing-off does not directly protect names, marks, get up or other indicia.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>However, having perused the judgment as a whole, it seems to us clear that the learned judge was conscious that `goodwill` relates to business even though he had in various places referred to `goodwill in the name`. We think what the learned judge wanted to do, perhaps not entirely accurately, was to use that phrase as a short form to encapsulate the idea of `goodwill in a business as represented by the name ONE.99`. This can be seen from the factors he considered in determining whether the respondents had acquired sufficient goodwill in the business to sustain a passing-off action.<br/><br/>As indicated earlier, during the period of one and a half years of trading before the appellants set up their first outlet, the respondents enjoyed a huge turnover in their business: $3.5m for the first 11 months and $6.9m for the next 12-month period. Bearing in mind that the price of each item was only $1.99, this would represent a very large number of customers who had patronised the respondents` shops. In our view that would be evidence of goodwill. Even the appellants have to admit, and to quote from their case, `the respondents` business turnover is relatively substantial which is indicative of the existence of at least some goodwill in the business.`<br/><br/>The huge customer base which the respondents had built up in that one and a half year period was no doubt due to a combination of factors: the advertising impact, the media coverage, both in terms of news report as well as special articles, the cheap but yet relative good quality goods sold therein and the friendly service rendered by their sales staff. As this court had ruled in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1998:2:550:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1998:2:550:\">  [1998] 2 SLR 550 </a>, advertising and media publication can help a business to acquire goodwill. The results of the survey conducted by Asia Market Intelligence which showed that some 48% of the 300 persons interviewed were aware or had heard of the ONE.99 Shop and at least 40% of the interviewees were aware of the shops` locations demonstrated that the business of ONE.99 was known fairly widely. This is quite understandable bearing in mind that at the time the respondents` outlets were the first and only shops selling goods at the fixed price of $1.99.<br/><br/>In the result we agree with the learned judge that the respondents had on the relevant date acquired goodwill in the business bearing the name `ONE.99`, which was a business of a retailer selling miscellaneous goods at a fixed price.<br/><br/><strong><i> Fancy or descriptive? </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now turn to the second element, the question of misrepresentation. What the respondents` assert to be the distinction of their business is in their name `ONE.99`. They say that the appellants by using the name `Lifestyle 1.99` are representing that the two businesses are related. In this connection, the question of whether the name `ONE.99` is fancy or descriptive is highly critical. It is on this aspect that the appellants argued very strenuously that the learned judge had gone wrong when he held that the name is a fancy one. They contended that the judge applied the wrong test in determining the question when he said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In my view, the fundamental test to be applied in determining whether a name is a descriptive or fancy name is to see what ostensible meaning the name conjures in the context of its business.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The law treats quite differently the name or mark of a business depending upon whether the name or mark is descriptive or `fancy`. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>British Vacuum Cleaner Co v New Vacuum Cleaner Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1907] 2 Ch 312</font> at 321, Parker J said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... I think a distinction must always be drawn between cases in which the word in question, the word which it is proposed to restrain the defendant from using is a word of ordinary use, descriptive of an article, and cases in which the word complained of more or less, partakes of the character of a `fancy word`, or primarily, does not relate to the article but to the person who makes the article.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>A name or mark which is prima facie descriptive will only be protected if it can be shown to have acquired a secondary meaning, namely, it has become distinctive of the plaintiff`s business. `Distinctive` is a term of art in the law of passing-off and bears a meaning at variance with that in everyday use. In relation to a name or mark, it denotes the goods of the plaintiffs to the exclusion of other traders. <strong><i> Wadlow on The Law of Passing Off </i></strong> (at pp 391-392) describes how a mark/name is to be categorised, and the consequences flowing therefrom, as follows:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>A fancy word is one which has no obvious relevance to the character or quality of the goods or business in relation to which it is used, such as <strong> Eureka</strong> for shirts, <strong> Clock</strong> for an hotel or <strong> June</strong> for toiletries. It is `of an arbitrary and fanciful nature` in that context. Whether a word is fancy or descriptive may depend on how it is used. <strong> Health</strong> may plausibly be called a fancy word in respect of fishing gear but not for cocoa. The significance of the difference is that distinctiveness is very much more easily acquired for fancy words, and it is inappropriate to speak of secondary meaning when the word has no primary meaning to displace. However, the decision to categorise a word as fancy or descriptive is only one part of the wider issue of whether there is a material representation to restrain. Inherent ability to distinguish is always a matter of degree with there being a continuous spectrum between the highly fanciful and the obviously descriptive. Wherever the name may fall on that range, what matters is whether the name is distinctive in fact.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We note that while the learned judge felt that `ONE.99` qualifies as a fancy name, he recognised `there is a connection between ONE.99 and the business of selling goods at $1.99.` But he added that the connection was not straightforward. The reason he came to that conclusion was because he thought there was `sufficient novelty and features in the idea for it to qualify as a fancy name.` He also noted that while numbers may `connect, indicate, and represent ideas, ... it is straining the language to say that they \"describe\".` The judge further said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The name `ONE Point Nine Nine` as is read and pronounced does not immediately lead one to think of the shop as a $1.99 Shop. The connection becomes obvious after a while and therein lies the sublety that makes it, in my view, a fancy name, ... The omission of the $ sign in both cases is thus significant. In the (respondents`) case it shears the descriptive character from the name.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>With respect to the learned judge we think the name `ONE.99` is quite clearly descriptive, bearing in mind the business that is carried out in the respondent`s outlets, namely, the selling of goods at $1.99`. He recognised it as much, though he said that it only becomes obvious `after a while`. Ms Chong tried to explain that she chose the name `ONE.99` because it was `magical`. We are unable to follow that. Furthermore, in court, she added that `99` also meant `everlasting` in Mandarin. This may well be so. But `ONE.99` or `1.99` must obviously have come from the fact that she intended to sell the things in her shop at the price of $1.99. We cannot accept that `ONE.99` was arbitrarily chosen. The link is clear. We also do not think that `ONE.99` or `1.99` will, in oral conversation, be referred to as `One point ninety-nine.` More likely than not, the `dot` will be omitted. Let us illustrate. If one were to buy an article at say $2.99, and if one were to be asked how much it costs, the answer that any person would normally give would be `two ninety-nine`, omitting the dot, as well as the $. It is wholly unreal to suggest that the `dot` would be pronounced.<br/><br/>In this regard, we think the case  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>McCain International Ltd v Country Fair Foods Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1981]  RPC 69</font> is quite instructive. There the plaintiffs had introduced potato chips cooked in an oven and called them `McCain Oven Chips`. The defendants sold `Country Fair Oven Chips` and `Birds Eye Oven Chips`. The Court of Appeal held that there was no arguable case of passing-off against the defendants and that the name `oven chips` was descriptive of the product; it was not a fancy name. The plaintiffs sought to argue that the two words were `an  ungrammatical aggregate of two English nouns and that it was nonsensical without an explanation.` This was how Templeman LJ dealt with the argument:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>But in my judgment the words `oven chips`, grammatical or not, constitute an expression which is an ingenious and apt description of the contents, namely, potato chips prepared for cooking in the oven; and although the consumer may not have been aware, and could not have been aware of what the expression meant until oven chips came on to the market, once they had come on the market he could recognise a name which is apt and appropriate to describe a produce rather than a manufacturer, the product being potato chips prepared for cooking in the oven. The fact that the name `oven chips` does not indicate that the chips may also be grilled is neither here nor there. The name does inform the consumer of what is inside the package so that he may know what he is purchasing.`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Horlick`s Malted Milk Co v Summerskill</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1916] 33 RPC 108</font>, the plaintiffs manufactured a food preparation which they sold as `Horlick`s Malted Milk`. The defendants sold a food preparation under the name `Headley`s Malted Milk`. The plaintiffs brought a passing off action and sought to restrain the defendants from using the words `Malted Milk`. The Court of Appeal, agreeing with Joyce J, held that those were descriptive words meaning milk to which malt had been added or applied and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to restrain the defendants from using the descriptive words to identify their products.<br/><br/>A case which shows that the court would treat words as descriptive notwithstanding deliberate alterations made to them so that as spelt there are no such words in the English language is  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ancona Printing Ltd v Kwik-Kopy Corp</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1973]  CPR (2d) 122</font>. In <strong><i> Ancona Printing </i></strong> the plaintiff for some 13 years carried on business of copying and duplicating documents under the style `Kopy Kwik Printing` and sought to restrain the defendants who were in the business of printing written material from using the name `Kwik-Kopy Printing`. Both were operating in the same area in Kitchener, Ontario. Notwithstanding evidence of confusion, the High Court refused to continue the ex parte injunction. While `Kopy Kwik` are not English words (presumably intended to be a fanciful expression of `copy` and `quick`), White J held that `Kopy-Kwik Printing` was a descriptive expression.<br/><br/>Reverting to our instant case, we have no doubt that once the public realise that the goods sold in the ONE.99 outlets are all fixed at a price of $1.99, it does not require much imagination to appreciate that the name `ONE.99` is intended to inform all consumers that the goods sold therein are so priced. It, therefore, is descriptive.<br/><br/><strong><i> Secondary meaning: distinctiveness </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Of course the fact that a name is descriptive does not mean that it could not become distinctive although it would be difficult. It would appear that the only case which held that a descriptive term had become distinctive of the plaintiffs is the early case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Frank Reddaway &amp; Co v George Banham &amp; Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1896]  AC 199</font> where the term was held to have acquired a secondary signification. There the plaintiffs succeeded in establishing that between 1879 and 1891 the term `camel-hair belting` had acquired a secondary meaning. Lord Herschell said (at p 213) that the term `did not convey to persons dealing in belting the idea that it was made  of camel`s hair, but that it was belting manufactured by the plaintiffs.` It seems to us that the court in <strong><i> Reddaway </i></strong>reached that conclusion due in no small part to the fact that there was a letter which on the face of it not only showed a dishonest intent on the part of the person who was proposing to use the term `camel`s hair belting` but also contained an admission that such a secondary or subsidiary meaning did exist.<br/><br/>In contrast, in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Cellular Clothing Co Ltd v Maxton and Murray</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1899]  AC 326</font>, the plaintiffs invented a fashion suitable for shirting and underwear woven in a particular manner and had marketed it for ten years under the name `cellular cloth`. The defendants sold cotton and woollen goods which they recently described as `cellular`. The House of Lords held that the word `cellular` was an ordinary English word which appropriately and conveniently described the cloth of which the goods sold by the plaintiffs were manufactured. Lord Halsbury said, at p 336:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>where you are dealing with a name which is properly descriptive of the article the burden is very great to shew that by reason of your using that name descriptive of the article you are selling, you are affecting to sell the goods of somebody else ... under ordinary circumstances it would be very difficult to establish ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Lord Shand, commenting on <strong><i> Reddaway </i></strong>, said at p 340:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Of that case I shall only say, that it no doubt shews it is possible where a descriptive name has been used to prove that so general, I should rather say so universal, has been the use of it as to give it a secondary meaning and so to confer on the person who has so used it a right to its exclusive use or, at all events, to such a use that others employing it must qualify their use by some distinguishing characteristic. But I confess I have always thought, and I still think, that it should be made almost impossible for any one to obtain the exclusive right to the use of a word or term which is in ordinary use in our language and which is descriptive only - and, indeed, were it not for the decision in <strong> Reddaway</strong>`s case, I should say this should be made altogether impossible.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>As would be apparent from the opinion of their Lordships quoted above, when a descriptive name is used, a very great burden is placed on a plaintiff to prove that the name has acquired a secondary meaning. All the more so where a descriptive name is put to an invented article (or as in the case here of a term to indicate a new sale concept at a fixed price of $1.99), the problem of proving secondary meaning will be further compounded and the reason for that is, and here we will quote Lord Davey in <strong><i> Cellular Clothing Co </i></strong> (at pp 343-344):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... that where a man produces or invents, if you please, a new article and attaches a descriptive name to it - a name which, as the article has not been produced before, has, of course, not been used in connection with the article - and secures for himself either the legal monopoly or a monopoly in fact of the sale of that article for a certain time, the evidence of persons who come forward and say that the name in question suggests to their minds and is associated by them with the plaintiff`s goods alone is of a very slender character; for the simple reason that the plaintiff was the only maker of the goods during the time that his monopoly lasted, and therefore there was nothing to compare with it, and anybody who wanted the goods had no shop to go to, or no merchant or manufacturer to resort to except the plaintiff.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>This opinion of Lord Davey expressed in <strong><i> Cellular Clothing Co </i></strong> was applied by Parker J in <strong><i> British Vacuum Cleaning Co Ltd </i></strong> (supra) where he held that no  secondary meaning was proved in respect of the descriptive words `vacuum cleaner`. This was how he further elucidated the point (at p 325):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I think that the evidence itself - what there is of it - really points to the fact that the public have understood `vacuum cleaner` and the `vacuum cleaning process` to be a description of a particular kind of cleaner and a particular process, a cleaner, namely, which operates by means of a nozzle applied to the furniture and the suction in the pipes caused by the vacuum created by the machine. As long as the plaintiff company was the only manufacturer who manufactured and dealt with and went from house to house with a machine of that sort, no doubt in the mind of the public there would be a connotation of the fact that the machine was the machine of the plaintiff company. But I do not think that primarily the words have ever been in the mind of the public anything else than descriptive words, and, if that be so, then it appears to me that the case falls for this purpose within what was said by Lord Davey, namely, that no great inference can be drawn from the fact that during the period when the patentee has had a monopoly, or the manufacturer has had a monopoly, either at law or in fact, words primarily descriptive of an article have become associated with the patentee or manufacturer. <strong> There is nothing, and there was nothing, as he said, for the public to contrast it with, so that it is impossible to say that the public understood by those words a machine dealt in or brought round by any one person or company as distinguished from any other person or company.</strong>` [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the light of the authorities above, it is clear that where the name of a business is descriptive and it is the first of such business, it is difficult to show distinctiveness in the sense we have indicated earlier. Furthermore, when descriptive words are used, a slight difference between the names would suffice to distinguish them. This is illustrated in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Window &amp; General Cleaners Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1946] 63 RPC 39</font> where both the plaintiffs and the defendants carried on the business of office cleaners, the former under the style `Office Cleaning Service` since 1930 and the latter `Westminster Office Cleaning` since 1933, which the defendants changed in 1942 to `Office Cleaning Association`. The plaintiffs sought to restrain the defendants from using the latter style on the ground that it was likely to cause confusion. The plaintiffs admitted that they had no monopoly in the two words `Office Cleaning` and that these two words had not acquired a secondary meaning so as to be distinctive of them. The High Court granted relief to the plaintiffs. This decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal which held that as the words here were clearly descriptive, and in the absence of fraud, a slight difference in the titles of the plaintiffs and the defendants would be a sufficient distinction. The Court of Appeal decision was upheld by the House of Lords. Lord Simmonds who delivered the leading judgment for the House said (at p 43):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It comes in the end, I think, to no more than this, that where a trader adopts words in common use for his trade name, some risk of confusion is inevitable. But that risk must be run unless the first user is allowed unfairly to monopolise the words. The court will accept comparatively small differences as sufficient to avert confusion.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Some other cases where the same principle was applied were <strong><i> British Vacuum Cleaner Co Ltd v New Vacuum Cleaner Co Ltd </i></strong> (supra), <strong><i> McCain International Ltd v Country Fair Foods </i></strong> (supra),  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Burberrys v JC Cording &amp; Co Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1909] 26 RPC 693</font> (concerning slip-on coats) and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Deane v Schofield</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1962]  RPC 179</font> (involving `The Under Six Club` and `The Over-Six Club`).<br/><br/>Reverting to the case in hand, and having considered the evidence, firstly, we do not think there was really any design on the part of the appellants to take an unfair advantage of the name `ONE.99` or `1.99`. As indicated before, the appellants` parent company had been engaging in ad hoc promotional sales of products at $1.99 from September 1997. Secondly, as the name `ONE.99` or `1.99` is in the circumstances descriptive, the measures which the appellants had taken to distinguish the two businesses, `Lifestyle 1.99` compared with `ONE.99 shop`, are adequate. The respondents cannot claim a monopoly to the concept of selling goods at a fixed price of $1.99 which would be the case if no others are allowed to use `1.99`. The additional word `Lifestyle` should suffice to differentiate. And when we take into account the fact that the colour scheme of their outlets, as well as their logo, are clearly different from those of the respondents, all the more so we do not think there could be any reasonable probability of deception.<br/><br/>On the respondents` part they relied on the Canadian case  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Joseph v Lee</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1984] 78 CPR (2d) 159</font> to argue that a name or mark in figures could acquire distinctiveness. There, the plaintiff was carrying on coin-operated games business as `501 Video`. Subsequently, the defendants commenced a similar business under the style `501 Arcade`. The defendants also selected free game cards of the same colour and conformation as free games cards issued by `501 Video`. An injunction against the defendants was issued by the County Court of Frontenne, Ontario. From the report, it seems to us that the learned judge did not draw any distinction between a fancy name and a descriptive name. He said that `501 Video` constituted `a sufficient descriptive term or trade name as to cause them to be distinguishing words`. None of the issues referred to in <strong><i> Office Cleaning Services </i></strong> were considered. It seems to us that the case could perhaps be justified on the ground that `501` was really fanciful, as it had nothing to do with coin-operated video games. Further, in <strong><i> Joseph v Lee </i></strong> there was clear evidence that the defendants there intended to deceive.<br/><br/>It is not in dispute that `figures` could be distinctive, as decided in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hymac Ltd v Priestman Brothers Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1978]  RPC 495</font> where the plaintiffs who were manufacturers of excavators made excavators known as the `580` series. This figure was derived from the capacity of the particular excavation bucket used on such machines which was five-eights of a cubic yard. The defendants also began to market an excavator using the figure `580` for identification. The defendants claimed that they were only using a number which had descriptive connotation and which anyone could use. The defendants could not show that `580` was derived from the capacity of their bucket. From the reasoning of Walton J what comes across is that he did not think that the figure `580` could be descriptive. We are fortified in this view by the following utterances he made:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... given a number and nothing else it is quite impossible for anybody to deduce if that number refers to weight, bucket capacity or indeed engine power`. [At p 497.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>even if it is known that the number refers to bucket capacity, that bucket capacity may be cubic yards, cubic metres, or litres. Even if that was known that is still not the end of the matter because the various manufacturers use various conventional multipliers. Insley use 1000, Menck use 100, Hitachi use 10 and Poclain use 10. There is absolutely  not that kind of consistency which enables one to say from the number what it is about and what it means at all. Even if one does know that it refers to bucket capacity one is just as wise as ever.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>whatever sensible multiplier you use you cannot get five-eighths from 580.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Once one realises that the interpretation of the number 580 requires the kind of key that it does require, a key to be supplied by the plaintiffs, one wonders, why 580 was used by the defendants at all. I have seen nothing in the case to cause me to cease to wonder at that.` [At p 498.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Of course <strong><i> Hymac </i></strong> was a case concerning the issue of an interlocutory injunction. As the court held that the plaintiff had shown there was a seriously arguable case for passing off and `conceivably fraud`, relief was granted.<br/><br/>The Scottish case  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>PC Products Ltd v Wilfred Doulton</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1957]  RPC 199</font> can also be distinguished on the ground that the mark was clearly fanciful. There the plaintiff manufactured a cleaning preparation known in the trade as `one thousand and one` and sold in bottles bearing a label on which were prominently displayed the figures `1001`. The defendant put on the market another cleaning preparation in bottles, also prominently displaying the figures `1001`. An injunction was granted against the defendant.<br/><br/><font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Slazenger &amp; Sons v Feltham &amp; Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1889] 6 RPC 531</font> should similarly be distinguished because the use of the words `The Demon` on a tennis racquet must clearly be fanciful.<br/><br/>Perhaps, to the perception of some, what the appellants had done amounted to riding on the favourable publicity generated by Ms Chong and her company on the new sales concept. While the law of passing off is adaptable to changing trading practices, there is no tort of unfair competition. The case  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1981] 1 All ER 213</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1981] 1 WLR 193</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1981]  RPC 429</font> provides a useful illustration. There, the plaintiffs launched a lemon drink (`Solo`) with a publicity blitz. The defendants then launched a lemon drink (`Pub Squash`) with a get up and advertising theme closely resembling those for Solo. The Privy Council upheld the decision of the court below which dismissed the plaintiffs` claim for injunction and damages. The Privy Council held that the defendants had sufficiently distinguished their goods from those of the plaintiffs to prevent any likely confusion from arising. While in the court below an argument based on unfair competition was raised, it was not raised before the Privy Council.<br/><br/>In the result, we do not think that the respondents have shown that there has been any misrepresentation. We noted the evidence relating to the survey results show that there were members of the public who thought the two businesses were related. But in the nature of things some such misconception would be inevitable when you have two businesses adopting a similar descriptive term as a part of their names. Given a little time the public will be able to distinguish, now that the two  businesses are operating side-by-side. Otherwise, it would amount to granting a monopoly to the person who happens to use that descriptive term first.<br/><br/>In the light of our views above on the second element to establish the tort of passing-off, we do not think it is necessary for us to consider the third element relating to damage.<br/><br/><strong><i> Judgment </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In the premises, we would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the court below and dismiss the respondents` claim.

The Comptroller of Income Tax (\u201cthe Comptroller\u201d) refused to allow the deduction and to treat the expenses as losses. The taxpayer appealed to the Income Tax Board of Review (\u201cthe ITBR\u201d) which upheld the decision of the Comptroller. The taxpayer then appealed to the High Court in District Court Appeal No\u00a014 of 2004 where Andrew Ang\u00a0J (\u201cthe judge\u201d) affirmed the ITBR\u2019s decision but disagreed with it on one of two issues.

It was agreed that expenses were not deductible under s\u00a014 of the Act if there was no business in existence at the time the said expenses were incurred. Under the first issue, the ITBR was of the view that the said expenses of the taxpayer were incurred before the commencement of the business of letting out the shopping mall in question as that business commenced only when the TOP was granted. In respect of the second issue, the ITBR held that the interest paid, being capital in nature, was specifically disallowed under s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Act.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge agreed with the ITBR on the pre-commencement issue but disagreed with its decision on the capital expenditure issue.

The Comptroller also submitted that there was no good reason why the costs order sought by the taxpayer should be made in this case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The decision of the Court of Appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Issue 1 \u2013 The pre-commencement issue</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge framed this issue in the following manner (see <nobr>[2005] 4 SLR 285</nobr> at [10]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Was the appellant carrying on business at the time it incurred the said expenses? If it was not, the expenses are not allowable, being pre-commencement expenses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In our view, in order to ascertain whether the taxpayer had commenced business, we have to enquire what that business was: <i>Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation</i> (1998) 84\u00a0FCR 541 at 557. Both the taxpayer and the Comptroller agreed that the taxpayer\u2019s business included the management of the shopping mall and the generating of rental income from letting out the various units therein. Their positions diverged on the issue of whether the business extended to matters that had occurred at any time before the grant of the TOP.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The taxpayer argued that its business extended to the acquisition of the land on which the shopping mall was subsequently built as well as the construction of the shopping mall. If that was the correct position, the taxpayer\u2019s business would have commenced from the time it committed itself financially. It accepted that a mere mental commitment to purchase the land was not sufficient. On 4\u00a0July 1992, it paid 25% of the price for the land and on 4\u00a0September 1992, it paid the balance. It was seeking to deduct only the expenses incurred after the superstructure works had commenced and not the costs of construction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The taxpayer sought to characterise its business by reference to the objects enumerated in its memorandum of association (see para\u00a02 of the Agreed Statement of Facts). Relying on the words of Pollock\u00a0MR in <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v Westleigh Estates Company, Limited</i> <nobr>[1924] 1 KB 390</nobr> at 409, it argued that if a company\u2019s objects were business objects and were in fact carried out, then the company should be regarded as carrying on business. Since its objects encompassed the purchase of land and the construction of the shopping mall, the very things that it proceeded to carry out, it submitted that its business must extend to such purchase and construction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the objects clause in a company\u2019s memorandum of association could provide some useful guide as to the nature of its business, it has to be noted that many companies have very broadly defined objects in a wide range of businesses in their memoranda. Indeed, some may seek to have invisible boundaries by having all-encompassing clauses such as \u201cand such other lawful businesses and activities as may be decided by the directors from time to time\u201d. It was therefore for good reason that Lord\u00a0Diplock in <i>American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue</i> <nobr>[1979] AC 676</nobr> at 683 observed that Pollock\u00a0MR\u2019s words in the case cited above should be read in the context of a company carrying out one of its principal objects and that not every isolated act authorised by its memorandum of association necessarily qualified as the carrying on of a business. Similarly, in <i>Mitsui-Soko International Pte Ltd v The Comptroller of Income Tax</i> (1998) MSTC 7,349 at 7,352\u20137,353 (\u201c<i>Mitsui-Soko</i>\u201d), Warren Khoo\u00a0J in the High Court cautioned against adopting Pollock\u00a0MR\u2019s words as a statement of a rule or principle because the practice of having widely worded memoranda of association often obfuscated the purpose for which a particular company was formed, and a literal application of Pollock\u00a0MR\u2019s <i>dictum</i> might result in almost every economic activity undertaken by a company as constituting the carrying on of business.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The inquiry should therefore focus on what a company actually carries on rather than what it professes to carry on in order to know what its true business is (<i>The</i> <i>Commissioners of Inland Revenue v The Hyndland Investment Company, Limited</i> (1929) 14\u00a0TC 694 at 699; <i>Mount Elizabeth (Pte) Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</i> <nobr>[1986] SLR 421</nobr>). The facts of each case should then be examined to determine whether the activities in issue are merely preparatory acts or whether they constitute the carrying on of that business. We agree that a commonsensical and pragmatic approach, as advocated in <i>Mitsui-Soko</i>, ought to be adopted. We also agree with the following observation made by the judge below ([8] <i>supra</i> at [18]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In tax cases where the issue was whether the taxpayer company was either investing or dealing in property, the courts have not been timorous to disregard objects which they considered to be self-serving and to look instead at the operations of the company to determine what its true business was. It should be no different where the enquiry is into the date of commencement of a company\u2019s business as such enquiry will bring in tow the question what the business of the company is. Each case will have to be examined on its facts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As found by the judge, the letting out of the shopping mall was the only regular activity and the primary source of the taxpayer\u2019s income. The business of the taxpayer was therefore the letting out of the shopping mall. Since this was the business of the taxpayer, it followed that its business could not have commenced before the TOP was granted for the shopping mall as it would not have been able to embark on its income-generating activity, which was the taking in of tenants. It was only upon the grant of the TOP that the shopping mall was capable of producing income and the taxpayer company was ready to begin its ordinary business operations. The purchase of the land and the construction works were preparatory steps taken towards the ultimate object of owning, managing and operating the business of letting out. Although this court said in <i>Pinetree Resort Pte Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</i> <nobr>[2000] 4 SLR 1</nobr> at [47] that in determining whether the nexus between the incurrence of an expense and the production of income in s\u00a014 is present, \u201cthe business has to be looked at <i>as a whole set of operations</i> directed toward producing income, in which case an expenditure which is not capital expenditure is usually considered as having been incurred in gaining or producing income\u201d [emphasis added], that statement was made in the context of a business which had already commenced and was producing income. It was not meant to be a statement on when a business could be said to have commenced.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Indian decision in <i>Commissioner of Income Tax, Gujarat I v Saurashtra Cement and Chemical Industries Ltd</i> <nobr>[1973] 91 ITR 170</nobr> does not assist the taxpayer as the facts there were exceptional, apart from the peculiarities of Indian revenue law pointed out by the judge below (at [41] of his judgment, that there was a distinction between \u201csetting up\u201d of a business and \u201ccommencement of business\u201d in Indian revenue law). In that case, the taxpayer was in the business of manufacturing and selling cement. The three activities in issue were the extraction of limestone, the manufacture of cement and the sale thereof. The parties there agreed that the extraction of limestone did not constitute a distinct and independent business of the taxpayer. The court there concluded that the business commenced when the company started to quarry limestone and not at the later time when it commenced the manufacture of cement. It was held that all three activities constituted the business of the taxpayer and that the business could not be carried out without any one of them. The extraction of limestone, although not forming the core of the business, was a regular or continuous exercise in the day-to-day operations and was such an indivisible or intrinsic part of the business that it could be said that the business commenced with the extraction of limestone. In the present appeal, the taxpayer\u2019s purchase and development of the land was a one-off activity and, as we have indicated, its business could not have commenced before it was in a position to let out the various spaces available in the shopping mall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge\u2019s decision certainly did not imply that a business could never commence unless it turned in profits. If it were otherwise, s\u00a037(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act would be rendered otiose. Indeed, it is common for many a business to be making losses in the initial stages of its operations. However, this is different from a business which produces no income because it is not yet in a position to generate any. For a business to commence in a situation like the present case, the taxpayer must have established an income-generating asset or income-earning structure. In this case, that would be the shopping mall upon the grant of the TOP. The taxpayer could not invoke s\u00a037(2)(<i>a</i>) because it was unable to show that the expenses constituted a loss incurred in \u201cany trade, business, profession or vocation\u201d. It was unable to do that as it did not have in place at the material time the business of letting out of the shopping mall and therefore could not come within the terms of s\u00a014(1).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We therefore agree with the judge\u2019s decision on the pre-commencement issue and, like him, would hold that the expenses in issue were not deductible under s\u00a014 of the Act. On this ground alone, the appeal ought to be dismissed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Issue 2 - The capital expenditure issue</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this case, there was no dispute that the loans taken out were applied to the purchase of the land and that such loans were capital expenditure. The issue was whether the interest incurred on such loans was deductible. Applying ss\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>) and 15(1)(<i>c</i>) to the facts of this case, the Comptroller argued that interest on the loans before the grant of the TOP was of a capital nature or was \u201cin respect of \u2026 any sum employed \u2026 as capital\u201d and should therefore be disallowed as a deduction. The taxpayer contended that interest was inherently of a revenue nature and that the interest incurred was not caught by the prohibition in s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this capital expenditure issue, the judge was of the view that s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) was worded differently from its equivalent in the UK tax legislation and that case law on the latter, which held that the nature of interest depended on the nature of the underlying loan, was therefore inapplicable here. He reasoned as follows ([8] <i>supra</i> at [54] to [58]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the UK, the provision corresponding to our s\u00a015(1)(c) prescribes that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[N]o sum shall be deducted in respect of \u2026 any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In <i>The European Investment Trust Co Ltd v Jackson (Inspector of Taxes)</i> (1932) 18\u00a0TC 1 (\u201c<i>European Investment Trust</i>\u201d), the Court of Appeal in England apparently decided that whether or not interest was of a revenue or capital nature depended on whether the loan itself (which gave rise to the interest) was employed as capital in the business. This view was widely criticised and subsequently abrogated by legislation. In <i>Beauchamp (Inspector of Taxes) v F W Woolworth plc</i> <nobr>[1988] STC 714</nobr> (\u201c<i>Woolworth</i>\u201d), the English Court of Appeal had occasion to consider its \u00a0\u00a0 earlier decision in the <i>European Investment Trust</i> case. Nourse\u00a0LJ who delivered the judgment of the court described it as \u201ca very curious case\u201d. He then went on to say (at 717\u2013718):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Having read and re-read the report of <i>The European Investment Trust Co Ltd v</i> <i>Jackson</i> several times, I have come to a clear conclusion that it can only be explained on the footing that it was conceded throughout that the status of the interest as a deductible item was governed by the status of the advances, and that that concession was made because it was assumed that the words \u2018in respect of\u2019 were the equivalent of \u2018in connection with\u2019 or the like. Perhaps the words of the 1842 Act had been forgotten. If that assumption is made, I can well see that it can be said that the interest on the advances would be sums in respect of the advances and thus no more deductible than the advances themselves. However, a concession on that point is not the equivalent of a binding decision. Indeed, it is no decision at all. So I think that we are free to disregard that case so far as it related to interest, although its authority would no doubt be unimpeachable in regard to the advances themselves.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Although the decision of the Court of Appeal in the <i>Woolworth</i> case was reversed by the House of Lords, there is nothing in the House of Lords\u2019 judgment delivered by Lord\u00a0Templeman which detracts from the Court of Appeal\u2019s criticism of this aspect of the <i>European Investment Trust</i> case ([54] <i>supra</i>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So much then as to how the UK provision was construed in the <i>European Investment Trust</i> case. Should the Singapore provision be interpreted likewise? Although counsel for the appellant argued cogently why it ought not be likewise construed, he may have been a little generous in conceding that the language of the Singapore provision is close to its UK counterpart. As noted, the UK provision prescribes that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[N]o sum shall be deducted in respect of \u2026 any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In other words, \u201cno sum \u2026 in respect of any sum employed as capital \u2026\u201d is to be deducted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As framed, it is possible to construe the \u201csum\u201d first referred to as separate and distinct from the second. On this basis, it did no violence to the language of the UK provision for the <i>European Investment Trust</i> case ([54] <i>supra</i>) to construe the first sum as being referable to interest while the second referred to the principal amount on which the interest accrued.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Singapore provision is differently worded. It states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[N]o deduction shall be allowed in respect of \u2026 any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The provision makes no mention of any sum other than the sum employed or intended to be employed as capital. Whereas the words \u201cin respect of\u201d in the UK provision could be read to mean \u201cin connection with\u201d without doing violence to the statutory provision, the same words \u201cin connection with\u201d could not, in my view, comfortably substitute for \u201cin respect of\u201d in the Singapore provision. It would immediately invite the question \u201cDeduction of what?\u201d To my mind, the words \u201cin respect of\u201d in the Singapore provision is the equivalent of \u201cfor\u201d or \u201con account of\u201d. Thus, what is prohibited is the deduction of the sum employed or intended to be employed as capital.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is inconceivable that the legislature would provide in unambiguous terms in s\u00a014(1)(a) for the deduction of \u201cinterest upon any money borrowed \u2026 where \u2026 the interest was payable on capital employed in acquiring the income\u201d and then in the very next section prescribe in s\u00a015(1)(c) that interest on any sum employed as capital is not deductible. Neither was this the position taken by Revenue before the decision in <i>Wharf Properties Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Hong Kong)</i> [[1997]] STC\u00a0351 (\u201c<i>Wharf</i>\u201d).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge then went on to consider <i>Wharf</i> (a Hong Kong tax case which went before the Privy Council) and the High Court of Australia\u2019s decision in <i>Steele v DFC of T</i> 99 ATC 4242 (\u201c<i>Steele</i>\u201d). He concluded that <i>Steele</i>, which held by a 4:1 majority that interest outgoings were not of a capital nature, accorded more with the conventional and well-known distinction between revenue and capital expenditure and was to be preferred to the reasoning in <i>Wharf</i>. In <i>Wharf</i>, the issue before the Privy Council was whether interest on loans, taken out for the purchase of a train depot to redevelop it as a commercial complex, was deductible for tax purposes. The judge reasoned in the following manner before arriving at his conclusion that s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) was never intended to apply to interest on loans ([8] <i>supra</i> at [58] to [70]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 The relevant provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap\u00a0112) (Hong Kong) are as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a016(1)(a) provides that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 there shall be deducted all outgoings and expenses to the extent to which they are incurred during the basis period for that year of assessment by such person in the production of profits \u2026 including \u2013</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 sums payable \u2026 by way of interest upon any money borrowed by him for the purpose of producing such profits \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a017 then contains a list of expenditures for which no deduction is allowed. It includes:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 any expenditure of a capital nature.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Privy Council held that the interest was of a capital nature and, therefore, not an allowable deduction to the taxpayer. Apparently, as a result of this decision, the Revenue in Singapore changed their interpretation of s\u00a015(1)(c) despite the fact that s\u00a017(c) of the Hong Kong legislation is in terms much wider than s\u00a015(1)(c), disallowing, as it does, deduction for \u201cany expenditure of a capital nature\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further support for the appellant\u2019s construction of s\u00a015(1)(c) may be found in the history of the Singapore legislation. The Singapore Income Tax Ordinance was introduced in 1948, some 16 years after the <i>European Investment Trust</i> case ([54] <i>supra</i>). In his report to the Governors of the Malayan Union and Singapore in 1947, the draftsman, R\u00a0B\u00a0Heasman, a tax expert from the UK, had this to say about the draft legislation (in which our present s\u00a014 was cl\u00a011):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Part\u00a0IV \u2013 Ascertainment of Income</b> \u2013 Clause\u00a011 gives authority in general terms for the deduction of all outgoings and expenses wholly and exclusively incurred in earning the income. Certain deductions are mentioned specifically, e.g<i>.,</i> interest on borrowed money used in the business; rent payable by a trader in respect of land and buildings occupied by him for business purposes; bad and doubtful debts; contributions under the Widows &amp; Orphans\u2019 Funds; and contributions to pension, provident or similar funds approved by the Commissioner.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Note the simple formulation to describe the coverage of s\u00a014(1)(a): \u201cinterest on borrowed money used in the business\u201d. Counsel for the appellant submitted that that is what s\u00a014(1)(a) was intended to cover and how it should be read. If so, then specific provision was already made in the Singapore Income Tax Ordinance from its inception to overcome the effect of the decision in the <i>European Investment Trust</i>. That this was the intention is reinforced when it is remembered that at that time s\u00a015 was subject to the express provisions of s\u00a014. Thus an item of interest expense qualifying for deduction under s\u00a014 could not be disallowed by the general provisions of s\u00a015(1)(c) (\u201c\u2026 any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital\u201d). The <i>European Investment Trust</i> case, therefore, was inapplicable to Singapore as long ago as 1948.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to 1979, s\u00a015(1) commenced with the words \u201csubject to the provisions of this Act\u201d. However, the relationship between the two sections was regarded as one where the specific disallowances in s\u00a015(1) would override the general deduction provision of s\u00a014(1), but that if an item of expenditure passed the general positive test in s\u00a014(1), it would not be disqualified under a general disallowance under s\u00a015(1), especially s\u00a015(1)(b). As counsel for the appellant pointed out, this made sense as the legislature could not have intended that an item of expenditure which qualified under the general test in s\u00a014(1) should be disqualified under what was the reverse of the same test in s\u00a015(1)(b).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Malaysian Federal Court in <i>Director-General of Inland Revenue v Rakyat Berjaya Sdn Bhd</i> <nobr>[1984] 1 MLJ 248</nobr> endorsed this view of the relationship between the equivalent Malaysian sections (the Malaysian and Singapore income tax legislation both originating from the same colonial model):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Section\u00a039(1)(b) disallows \u201cany disbursements or expenses not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purpose of producing the gross income.\u201d If we substitute the words \u201cfor the purpose of\u201d for the word \u201cin\u201d the wording would then be the same as that of \u201cthe wholly and exclusively\u201d test in section\u00a033(1).

As was stated in <i>Craies on Statute Law</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th\u00a0Ed, 1971) at p. 378, quoting the Privy Council in the case of <i>Barker v Edger</i> <nobr>[1898] AC 748</nobr> at 754:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">When the legislature has given its attention to a separate subject, and made provision for it, the presumption is that a subsequent general enactment is not intended to interfere with the special provision <i>unless it manifests that intention very clearly</i>.

A new paragraph was added to s\u00a015(1) to disallow expenses in respect of a motor car which was not a business service passenger vehicle (or \u201cQ-plate\u201d car). The words \u201cSubject to\u201d in s\u00a015(1) were replaced by \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d. In order to preserve the deductibility of some of the specific items under s\u00a014(1) which would otherwise obviously run foul of the general disallowances in s\u00a015(1), exceptions were carved out of some of the paragraphs in s\u00a015(1).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was never envisaged that a specific deduction for interest on borrowed capital (provided for in s\u00a014(1)(a)) was required to be saved from the general words of s\u00a015(1)(b) or (c) because the accepted view was that the interest mentioned in s\u00a014(1)(a) was of a revenue and not capital nature. I would go further to say that on the construction which I have placed on the words in s\u00a015(1)(c), what is disallowed is a deduction in respect of the loan or advance and not the interest thereon. Accordingly, no saving words were required to be carved out of s\u00a015(1)(c).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the appellant\u2019s contention that the opening words \u201cSubject to\u201d were replaced by \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d to confer primacy on the disallowance for non Q-plate cars appears to be borne out by the Explanatory Memorandum to the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill (No\u00a09 of 1979) and the Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Reports (30\u00a0March 1979) that sets out the speech of the Minister for Finance at the Second Reading of the Bill.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The entire explanation in the Explanatory Memorandum on the clause amending s\u00a015(1) reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Clause\u00a05 amends section\u00a015 of the Act to disallow deduction of expenses incurred in respect of a motor vehicle which is not registered as a business service passenger vehicle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Minister\u2019s speech is similarly confined to an exposition of the \u201canomalous situation\u201d being targeted:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A sole proprietor or a partner of a professional firm can register his car as a private vehicle, use it in connection with his business, and claim tax deduction for expenses under section\u00a014 of the Income tax Act without having to pay the double road tax and Area Licence Fees applicable to business vehicles. To rectify this anomaly, clause\u00a05 of the Bill seeks to amend section\u00a015 of the Act to restrict the deduction for expenses only to motor cars which are registered as business service passenger vehicles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the appellant therefore submits that the legislature did not intend that the general disallowance provisions of s\u00a015(1)(c) were a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 limit or interference with the specific allowance under s\u00a014(1)(a). I accept that but more because, in my view, s\u00a015(1)(c) was never intended to apply \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to interest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the basis of this construction of s\u00a015(1)(c), the <i>Wharf</i> case would have no application in Singapore. \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the greatest respect to the judge, we do not think the different sentence structures adopted in our s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) and in the UK equivalent were meant to convey different meanings. In our view, the two provisions were effectively stating the same thing. The word \u201cdeduction\u201d in our s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) appears to us to refer to the same thing as the first \u201csum\u201d in the UK provision. The phrase \u201cin respect of\u201d has been said to be the widest of any expressions intended to convey some connection between two related subject matters (<i>Nowegijick v The Queen</i> 83\u00a0DTC 5041 at 5045). A plain reading of s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) does not compel us to exclude interest expenditure from its scope. The said provision applies to all capital expenditure. Interest in respect of a capital purpose is capital expenditure and is therefore incurred as a \u201csum employed or intended to be employed as capital\u201d within the meaning of s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reading s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) in the way we have indicated above need not result in a conflict with s\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>). For the provisions to conflict, it would have to be assumed that s\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>) allows the deductibility of all interest, including interest in respect of sums employed as capital, which is what s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) would prohibit if it does apply to interest. However, s\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>) allows the deductibility of interest payable on a loan only if it was \u201cpayable on capital employed in acquiring the income\u201d. Where a taxpayer has borrowed money for investment and incurred interest on the loan, the investment must produce income for the interest expense to be deductible under the Act (<i>Andermatt Investments Pte Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 451</nobr> at 460, [27] (\u201c<i>Andermatt</i>\u201d); <i>JD Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</i> <nobr>[2006] 1 SLR 484</nobr> at [48] (\u201c<i>JD Ltd</i>\u201d)). If the loan is applied towards an accretion of capital, the interest incurred thereon is not a deductible item. This means, in the context of this appeal, that only the interest incurred after the grant of the TOP qualifies for deduction under s\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>). The operative provision that excludes interest on loans taken out for the acquisition of capital is therefore s\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>) and there is no need to resort to s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Is s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) therefore redundant? It may be said that ss\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>) and 15(1)(<i>c</i>) approach the issue of interest expenditure from different angles and mirror each other in effect. However, s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>) still operates to preserve the exception (to the capital expenditure rule) embodied in s\u00a014(1)(<i>h</i>) (which permits capital expenditure in respect of mines or other sources of mineral deposits of a wasting nature to be deducted according to the rules made under s\u00a07), thereby ensuring that s\u00a014(1)(<i>h</i>) does not lose all effect after s\u00a014 was made subordinate to s\u00a015 by the legislative changes to the Act in 1979 (see [64] of the judge\u2019s judgment quoted above for the said changes).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as reliance was placed on the Australian decision of <i>Steele</i> ([19] <i>supra</i>), we note that the Australian tax position has already been shown to be different from ours in that the former requires a weaker link between deductible expenses and the source of income (see <i>Andermatt</i> and <i>JD Ltd</i>). We also note that the three judges (Gleeson\u00a0CJ, Gaudron and Gummow\u00a0JJ) in <i>Steele</i> who made the remarks at [29] of that case quoted by the judge here ([8] <i>supra</i> at [72]), also said (at [27] and [33]) that the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure was not a critical one in Australian tax law:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 An example of the difference between the British and Australian systems is provided by the <i>European Investment Trust Co Ltd v Jackson</i>, a case decided eight years before Dixon\u00a0J\u2019s observation, where Finlay\u00a0J said that in the British system it was \u201cthoroughly well established by a long line of cases that [interest] is not deductible if it is in truth the interest on capital\u201d. In that case, a distinction was drawn between a sum expended in order to earn profits, which formed a valid deduction in arriving at the profits, and a sum expended to obtain capital. That has never been the critical distinction in Australia.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As was explained in <i>Australia National Hotels v FC of T</i>, interest is ordinarily a recurrent or periodic payment which secures, not an enduring advantage, but, rather, the use of the borrowed money during the term of the loan. According to the criteria noted by Dixon\u00a0J in <i>Sun Newspapers Ltd and Associated Newspapers Ltd v FC of T</i> it is therefore ordinarily a revenue item. This is not to deny the possibility that there may be particular circumstances where it is proper to regard the purpose of the interest payments as something other than the raising or maintenance of the borrowing and thus, potentially, of a capital nature. However, in the usual case, of which the present is an example, where interest is a recurrent payment to secure the use for a limited time of loan funds, then it is proper to regard the interest as a revenue item, and its character is not altered by reason of the fact that the borrowed funds are used to purchase a capital asset. \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026 In particular, the distinction between acquiring a capital asset and holding it as an income-producing investment, which may be related to the concept of calculating the profits of a business activity, is not one upon which the Australian legislation turns.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Interest is derivative in nature. It owes its existence to a loan. Whether it is a capital or a revenue expense depends on the purpose for which the loan is employed. If the loan is used for developing a capital asset, the interest payable on that loan is not deductible for tax purposes. If the loan is employed in acquiring income, the interest thereon becomes deductible under s\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>). We therefore agree with the following statements made by the Privy Council in <i>Wharf</i> ((1997)\u00a0MSTC 11,025 at 11,028 and 11,029):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Thus, while the question of whether money is intended to be used for a capital or revenue purpose is inconclusive as to whether its receipt is a revenue receipt or an addition to the company\u2019s capital, the purpose of the loan during the period for which the interest payment was made is critical to whether it counts as a capital or revenue expense.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Each payment of interest must be considered in relation to the purpose of the loan during the period for which the interest is paid. Once the asset has been acquired or created and is producing income, the interest is part of the cost of generating that income and therefore a revenue expense.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Accordingly, we respectfully disagree with the judge that the interest incurred is inherently revenue in nature. As the loans in question were used to purchase and develop a capital asset in this case, the interest incurred thereon could not qualify as a deductible under s\u00a014(1)(<i>a</i>) as it was a capital expense. It would naturally also be disallowed under s\u00a015(1)(<i>c</i>). We would therefore uphold the decision of the ITBR on this second issue as well.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Costs</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated earlier, should we uphold the decision of the judge, the taxpayer urged us to order that each party bear its own costs because the Comptroller had succeeded on only one of the two grounds of appeal before the judge and since this was a test case. In the light of our decision above, the first basis for this submission has disappeared. On the second basis, this was a test case only in the sense that the taxpayer had decided to challenge established legal norms. The pre-commencement issue could hardly be said to be a novel point of law and the factual situation of the taxpayer was certainly not unique.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We saw no reason why costs should not follow the event in this appeal. We therefore dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s appeal with costs. The deposit for the appeal is to be paid out to the Comptroller as part of his costs.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The appellants, Kea Holdings Pte Ltd (`Kea Holdings`) and Kea Resources Pte Ltd (`Kea Resources`) had brought 16 claims against Gan, pertaining, inter alia, to alleged breach of fiduciary duties owed to Kea Resources by Gan during his time as a managing director of Kea Resources. Gan counterclaimed against Kea Resources for annual wage supplements, various guaranteed bonuses and CPF contributions. The trial judge allowed five of the claims, but dismissed the remainder. He awarded the appellants S$101,536, US$60,000 and Rmb660,000, plus interest on these sums and half their costs. He also allowed the counterclaim and awarded Gan S$42,166.67 and CPF contributions on this amount, plus interest and half his costs to be taxed on the Subordinate Courts scale.<br/><br/><strong><i> Background facts </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Kea Holdings are a holding company. The second appellants, Kea Resources, are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kea Holdings, and are in the business of shipbuilding and the sale and purchase of vessels. Gan joined Kea Resources on 15 July 1993 as a general manager and subsequently became the managing director, holding this position up till 21 November 1998. While in this post, he became a shareholder and director of Sinindo Pacific Pte Ltd (`Sinindo`) together with an Indonesian businessman, Teddy Salim Liem (`Teddy Salim`).<br/><br/>On 12 February 1999, the appellants commenced proceedings against Gan comprising 16 claims relating to alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, breach of confidence and fraudulent misrepresentation. The trial judge decided in their favour on five claims. The appellants initially brought this appeal on seven of the claims that had been decided against them. However, the appellants subsequently proceeded on only four of the seven claims during the course of the appeal. These claims are:   </p>\n    <p>(a) claim arising from purchases by Sinindo Pacific Pte Ltd (Sinindo); </p>\n    <p>(b) claim in respect of three barges `Pacific 4`, `Pacific 5` and `Pacific 7`; </p>\n    <p>(c) claim arising from the sale of the `Regal 8` to Kea Maritime; and </p>\n    <p>(d) claim arising from the sale of the `Orient VI`.<br/><br/>As was pointed out by the trial judge, each claim was founded on its own facts and circumstances. As such, it would be convenient to deal with each claim on its own.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong> Claim arising from purchases by Sinindo Pacific Pte Ltd</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Sometime in May 1995, whilst Gan was the managing director of Kea Resources, he became a majority shareholder and director of Sinindo. The other shareholder and director was one Teddy Salim Liem (`Teddy Salim`). The respondent claimed that he had disclosed his involvement in Sinindo to the  appellants. However, they said that he only informed them that he was lending his name to Teddy Salim to form a company.<br/><br/>Between mid-1995 and mid-1996, Gan caused Sinindo to purchase five vessels from a company in China, China Jiangsu Machinery &amp; Equipment Import &amp; Export Corporation (`SUMEC`). The appellants claimed that, in doing that, Gan diverted business away from Kea Resources, and caused Kea Resources to suffer a loss of S$1,266,559, which represents profits they would have earned if they had sold the five vessels to Sinindo.<br/><br/>The trial judge held that in his capacity as director of Sinindo, Gan`s duty was to ensure that Sinindo bought the vessels from the best available source. He owed no duty to direct Sinindo`s business to Kea Resources. Kea Resources thus could not assert that, because Gan was also a director of Kea Resources, he should have placed the orders with Kea Resources. The judge therefore felt that nothing turned on the scope of Gan`s disclosure of his involvement with Sinindo to the appellants.<br/><br/>The trial judge further noted that Gan could not make any decisions to buy vessels for Sinindo without consulting Teddy Salim. Teddy Salim had not said in evidence that there was any agreement or understanding between him and Kea Resources that his companies would buy all their vessels from Kea Resources. There was no diversion of business from Kea Resources because there was no basis to suppose that the business would have gone to Kea Resources but for Gan`s intervention. The claim therefore failed.<br/><br/>On appeal, the appellants` main contention was that Gan had accepted a secret commission from SUMEC in return for his procuring Sinindo to purchase the vessels from SUMEC. The appellants tendered evidence purportedly relating to Gan`s receipt of the commission on the purchase of one of these vessels, `SP 2705`, by Sinindo. By doing this, the appellants said that he had placed his own interests above that of Kea Resources and had breached his fiduciary duties to Kea Resources.<br/><br/>Although the issue of the secret commission was not pleaded originally by the appellants, the argument was raised in the court below. In particular, the appellants tendered certain documents which formed the chief evidence in support of this allegation. The first document was a credit advice from the National Commercial Bank Ltd, Hong Kong, to Fuchuen Machinery &amp; Equipment (`Fuchuen`) stating that the sum of US$780,303.40 had been remitted to Fuchuen`s account from DBS Finance Ltd, who are Sinindo`s bankers. On this document was a handwritten note stating the name of the vessel, the price of the vessel (US$606,000) and that US$173,303.40 had been credited into Gan`s account (A/c No 163118). The other relevant documents were a letter written in Chinese and its accompanying English translation certifying that, after that sum was remitted to their account, Fuchuen remitted the amount of US$173,303.40 to the respondent`s Citibank account No 163118. Gan, however, denied that the sum of US$173,303.40 had been deposited into his account, though he admitted that he had a Citibank account bearing the number 163118. When asked if he knew why Fuchuen would write the letter if no money had been remitted to him, he said  he did not know. Gan refused to give discovery of his Citibank account on the basis that some of the assets in the account belonged to his relatives.<br/><br/>The trial judge did not make any finding as to whether Gan had indeed received the sum of US$173,303.40. Instead, as stated above, the decision was based on two reasons. First, that Gan had no duty to direct Sinindo`s business to Kea Resources and secondly, the fact that there was no diversion of business in this case as it had not been shown that Gan`s intervention had led to the series of events.<br/><br/>Now, the documents purportedly evidencing the fact that Gan had received a secret commission from SUMEC for procuring Sinindo to purchase the vessels, in particular, `SP 2705`, from SUMEC, were made by Fuchuen. The appellants explained that this was due to the fact that Fuchuen was the provider of letter of credit facilities for buyer companies like SUMEC. However, it was clear that the maker of these documents was not called upon by the appellants to give evidence. Instead, the appellants produced a witness, one Mr Yu Tian Lu, who was the manager of Zhejiang Machinery &amp; Equipment Import &amp; Export Corporation (ZMEC), as the representative of Fuchuen. He claimed to be authorised to give evidence on Fuchuen`s behalf by virtue of a letter from Fuchuen authorising him to be their witness.<br/><br/>In the circumstances, the documents purporting to evidence the payment of the secret commission by SUMEC to Gan amount to hearsay and are inadmissible as evidence. Counsel for the appellants pointed out to us that the authenticity of the documents had been admitted by Gan. However, such an agreement does not mean that Gan could not dispute the truth of the statements. It is this aspect of the documents that the hearsay principles apply to. The information in the documents were assertions of the fact that Gan had received a secret commission for the sale of `SP 2705`. In our view, this is a case where it would be highly unsafe to rely on the contents of these documents to prove the facts contained therein as the maker was not present in court. Counsel for Gan had no opportunity to cross-examine the maker and test the veracity of the assertions in the documents.<br/><br/>The presence of Mr Yu Tian Lu as Fuchuen`s representative and the fact that he may have had authorisation from Fuchuen to give evidence could not detract from the fact that the statements were hearsay. In any event, he did not claim to have any first-hand knowledge of the transaction between SUMEC, Fuchuen and Gan and said that he personally had nothing to do with Fuchuen himself. Furthermore, he did not even give any evidence, as the representative of Fuchuen, that Fuchuen had paid the secret commission to Gan. We also noted that apart from the letter of authorisation, there was apparently no other evidence that Mr Yu was indeed authorised to give evidence on behalf of Fuchuen. Quite apart from those concerns, no one from SUMEC was called to give evidence on the payment of the secret commission as well. That would have been the clearest evidence that Gan had indeed entered into such a transaction. Instead, the only reference to these documents was made by Mr Goh Siew Hua, the Group Accountant of Kea Holdings. However, he clearly had no first-hand or personal knowledge of whether the secret commission was in fact paid to Gan.<br/><br/>As for Gan`s refusal under cross-examination to produce details of his Citibank account into which the secret commission had purportedly been paid, we  did not think that his behaviour was sufficient for the court to draw an adverse inference that he had indeed received the money. He consistently denied having received the secret commission and said that he did not know why Fuchuen would have written the letter certifying that they had paid the sum of US$173,303.40 to him. While it may have been the case that producing the details would have put an end once and for all to the issue of whether the money had been paid into his account, it was nevertheless still the obligation of the appellants, as the plaintiffs, to prove their case against Gan. As the documents purportedly evidencing the payment of the secret commission should have been excluded as hearsay, the appellants had no other evidence to establish their claim that Gan had received a secret commission from SUMEC in respect of the purchase of `SP 2705` by Sinindo. In our judgment therefore, the appellants had not successfully proved that Fuchuen had paid a secret commission, on behalf of SUMEC, to Gan.<br/><br/>On this basis, we reject the appellants` claim that Gan had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties vis-.-vis Kea Resources. The appellants submitted that if Gan had received the secret commission, he would have been in a situation whereby his interests and that of Kea Resources would clash. In connection with this, the appellants cited  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1972] 2 All ER 162</font> to counter Gan`s argument that Sinindo would not have purchased the vessels from Kea Resources anyway. The appellants said that, applying <strong><i> Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley </i></strong>, Gan would nonetheless still be liable to Kea Resources for damages arising out of his breach of duty.<br/><br/><strong><i> In Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley </i></strong>, the defendant, Cooley was the managing director of the plaintiff company. The company was interested in obtaining certain contracts from the Eastern Gas Board but the Board was not satisfied with its set-up and refused to award the contract to it. The Gas Board then approached Cooley personally and invited him to be their project manager. Cooley resigned from the company and accepted the Gas Board`s position. The company brought an action against Cooley for account of profits. Cooley argued that he had not breached the duty because the Gas Board would not have awarded the plaintiffs the contracts in any event. This argument failed. Roskill J (at p 175) said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... It is said: `Well, even if there were that conflict of duty and interest, nonetheless, this was a contract with a third party in which the plaintiffs never could have had any interest because they would have never got it. That argument has been forcefully put before me by counsel for the defendant.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The remarkable position then arises that if one applies the equitable doctrine on which the plaintiffs rely to oblige the defendant to account, they will receive a benefit which on Mr Smetton`s evidence at least it is unlikely that they would ever have got for themselves had the defendant complied with his duty to them. On the other hand, if the defendant is not required to account he will have made a large profit as a result of having deliberately put himself into a position in which his duty to the plaintiffs who were employing him and his personal interest conflicted ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>If one looks at the way the cases have gone over the centuries it is plain that the question whether or not the benefit would have been obtained but for the breach of trust has always been treated as irrelevant ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellants also relied on  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hytech Builders Pte Ltd v Tan Eng Leong &amp; Anor</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1995:2:795:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1995:2:795:\">  [1995] 2 SLR 795 </a>. In this case, the plaintiff company claimed declarations  that the defendants were trustees of profits made by the second defendants, a company substantially owned and controlled by the first defendants, from a construction contract known as `Contract 220`, and for an account of profits. The first defendant was a director of the plaintiff company at all times. Contract 220 had been awarded by tender to `Kung Sing`, a Taiwanese company, the second defendants, and `HLS`, a Singapore company. Kung Sing had originally approached the plaintiff company with a view to a joint tender for the project. However, the plaintiff company did not qualify to tender for the project, so the board of directors had decided to tender for the contract in the name of a joint venture company, Sinbelco, in which the plaintiff company held a 50% stake, and which did qualify to tender. The plaintiff company`s board of directors had appointed the plaintiff to manage the tender project, but the first defendant instead tendered for the project using the second defendant`s name.<br/><br/>Warren LH Khoo J allowed the plaintiff`s claim. He held that as a director of the plaintiffs, the first defendant owed a fiduciary duty to them not to divert the business opportunity for his own profit. He acted in breach of that duty when he procured the second defendants to tender for the contract. This was so even though the first defendants did not qualify to tender for the project.<br/><br/>Also relevant is s 157 of the Companies Act (Cap 50), which is a statutory statement of a director`s duties under Singapore law. The provision states:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">As to the duty and liability of officers.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">157</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(1)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">A director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office.An officer or agent of a company shall not make improper use of any information acquired by virtue of his position as an officer or agent of the company to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself or for any other person or to cause detriment to the company.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(2)</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(3)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">An officer or agent who commits a breach of any of the provisions of this section shall be -</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(a)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">liable to the company for any profit made by him or for any damage suffered by the company as a result of the breach of any of those provisions; and</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(b)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(4)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">This section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other written law or rule of law relating to the duty or liability of directors or officers of a company.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">(5)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">In this section -</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">`officer` includes a person who at any time has been an officer of the company;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\">`agent` includes a banker, solicitor or auditor of the company and any person who at any time has been a banker, solicitor or auditor of the company.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Under s 157(4), the duties under s 157(1) are specifically stated not to be in derogation of any other rule of law relating to the duty or liability of directors or officers of a company, including the common law and equitable rules. There are two principles of conduct of relevance to the present case. First, that a director must act in what he honestly considers to be the company`s interest, and not in the interests of some other person or body. Secondly, the equitable rule that a fiduciary must not place himself in a position where his duty to the company and his personal interests may conflict.<br/><br/>In this case, the appellants alleged that Gan should have channelled the sale of the barges from SUMEC to Sinindo through Kea Resources so that Kea Resources could have earned a profit on them. The trial judge held that there was no such duty on him to do this. His duty was to obtain the best prices for Sinindo.<br/><br/>We agreed with this conclusion. We have decided that the appellants had not proved their allegation that Gan had received a secret commission relating to Sinindo`s purchase of `SP 2705` from SUMEC. As such, no conflict of interests arose between his personal benefit and that of Kea Resources. The facts of this case were different from the cases of <strong><i> Cooley </i></strong> and <strong><i> Hytech </i></strong> relied on by the appellants. In those cases, the defendants had acquired information as directors of the plaintiff companies and had earned a personal profit from the information. The court therefore ordered that the directors had to account for the profits made. The situation was different in this case. Here, the appellants failed to show that Gan had earned a secret commission from the sale of the vessel. The claim was thus correctly dismissed by the trial judge.<br/><br/><strong><i> Claim in respect of the barges `Pacific 4`, `Pacific 5` and `Pacific 7` </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Some time prior to 1996, before Gan joined Kea Resources, Kea Resources had ordered three barges from ZMEC. Gan subsequently suggested to the Chairman of Kea Resources, Mr Kea Meng Cheng, that the orders for the barges be cancelled because there were no buyers for the barges and also to avoid paying the export duty of 5% which would be imposed on the purchase. Mr Kea Meng Cheng agreed and the orders were cancelled on 22 August 1996, which led to Kea Resources forfeiting the deposits paid on each barge totalling US$77,610.<br/><br/>In the court below, the appellants alleged that Gan had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to Kea Resources because he knew that Sinindo was looking for barges at about the same time as the orders were cancelled, yet he recommended the cancellation. In this sense, this particular head of claim was connected to the issue above relating to the alleged diversion of business from the appellants to SUMEC. The appellants thus claimed the forfeited deposit from Gan.<br/><br/>The trial judge stated that the gravamen of the complaint was that Gan had acted improperly by causing Sinindo to buy three barges from SUMEC when Kea Resources had three barges available and awaiting collection from ZMEC. However, Gan had a duty to see that the orders placed by Sinindo were in the best interests of Sinindo. Gan owed no duty to Kea Resources to place the orders with them. The trial judge went on to say that in any event, there was no evidence that  the barges from ZMEC and those ordered by Sinindo from SUMEC were interchangeable. Also, the trial judge added at [para ] 20 of his judgment that:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... even if the defendant breached his fiduciary duty to Kea Resources in 1995 when Sinindo placed the orders with SUMEC, there is a leap in logic to conclude that he is accountable for the lost deposit payments following the cancellation of the orders from ZMEC in 1996, because Kea Resources did not order the three barges with the knowledge that Sinindo would be on the market for barges, and did not cancel the orders because Sinindo did not buy those barges from it.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellants submitted that in fact the three barges ordered from ZMEC were all of the same length, ie 270 feet, as those which were ordered from SUMEC. They said that the length of the vessel is the most important dimension in relation to a barge, whereas the width and height are of less importance to the purchaser. The vessels should therefore be treated as interchangeable. Further, they asserted that Kea Resources could have offered Sinindo similar terms for the three barges as Sinindo had paid to SUMEC.<br/><br/>Gan, on the other hand, contended that there was no evidence that the barges were identical, or interchangeable. The only available information was that the barges were of the same length, which is not the same as saying that they were interchangeable. Further, the appellants failed to prove that Gan was in control of Sinindo such that only he could have caused Sinindo to purchase vessels from SUMEC rather than from Kea Resources. It was Teddy Salim who was in fact controlling Sinindo.<br/><br/>Clearly, Gan was obliged both by his statutory duty under s 157(1) of the Companies Act and the general equitable principles governing the duties of fiduciaries to act in the best interests of Kea Resources. As stated above, this also encompasses a duty not to place himself in a position where his duty to Kea Resources and his own interests are in conflict. However, this does not mean that Gan was precluded from holding directorships in two companies. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Boulting v Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1963] 2 QB 606</font>, Upjohn LJ, as he then was, said in reference to the relationship between the `no conflict of interests` rule and directors who hold posts in more than one company that:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Directors ... may sometimes be placed in a position that, though their interest and duty conflict, they can properly and honestly give their services to both sides and serve two masters to the great advantage of both. If the person entitled to the benefit of the rule is content with that position and understands what are his rights in the matter, there is no reason why he should not relax the rule. ... To sum up the position, it is clear that the person entitled to the benefit of this positive rule is the person who is protected by it, but he, and he alone, can in proper circumstances relax it ... It cannot be used as a shield by the person owing the duty</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In other words, as long as the fact of this is disclosed to the company and approved, the holding of cross-directorships is not <strong><i> per se </i></strong> a breach of duty. In this case, the appellants knew that Gan was a director of Sinindo. However, this does not mean that Gan could then subordinate the interests of Kea Resources to Sinindo in a situation where their interests were in conflict.<br/><br/>In determining whether Gan had acted in breach of his duties to Kea Resources, we note that, although the facts of this claim were related to the claim above for diversion of business, the thrust of the claim was somewhat different. In this case, the complaint was that Gan did not tell Kea Resources that there was a willing buyer for the three barges in question in the form of Sinindo.<br/><br/>While we agree with the trial judge that Gan was under no duty to ensure that all orders from Sinindo should be placed with either one of the appellants, it is our view that the crucial fact in respect of this claim was Gan`s material misrepresentation which led to the forfeit of the deposit for the barges. This case was unlike the situation above where Gan made a decision not to procure Sinindo to purchase the vessels from the appellants. Here, Gan had misled the appellants, in particular Kea Resources, into believing that there was no buyer in the market when in fact Sinindo was interested in purchasing similar vessels. By doing so, he was not acting in the best interests of Kea Resources. As such, it was a breach of Gan`s duty to Kea Resources to act honestly in discharge of his duties as required by s 157 of the Companies Act. The forfeiture of the deposit was a real and proximate loss to Kea Resources caused by the respondent`s breach of duty and we order that Gan compensate Kea Resources for the loss of the deposits amounting to US$77,610.<br/><br/><strong><i> Claim arising from the sale of the `Regal 8` to Kea Maritime </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In November 1995, the vessel `Regal 8` was sold by Kea Maritime Pte Ltd (`Kea Maritime`), a company which is part of the same group as the appellants but was not a party to this action, to Trisakti Utama Shipping Pte Ltd (`Trisakti Utama`), another company in which Teddy Salim was involved. Gan was the managing director of Kea Maritime and owned 20% of its shares, with Kea Holdings owning the other 80%. However, the appellants were interested in the sale because Kea Resources had paid for the construction of the vessel. Payment for the vessel by Trisakti Utama was to be in 48 instalments and title was to be transferred upon the completion of the payments.<br/><br/>The vessel developed mechanical difficulties after it was delivered to Trisakti Utama. A dispute arose over whether the difficulties were caused by equipment failure or by improper maintenance. On 13 February 1997, the vessel sailed back to Singapore, and Kea Resources eventually incurred $338,493.29 for repairs. At that time, the instalment payments were in arrears. Kea Resources took the position that the agreement was terminated from that date, reasserted possession over the vessel, and forfeited the instalment payments made.<br/><br/>In the court below, the appellants had claimed the repair costs from Gan on the basis that he had failed in his fiduciary duties to Kea Resources to ensure that the vesel was properly maintained by the purchaser, and that he had taken the vessel back without the consent of Kea Resources. This claim was dismissed by the trial judge and there was no appeal against this decision.<br/><br/>However, the appellants also brought a related claim in respect of the sale of the `Regal 8` which was also dismissed by the trial judge, which the appellants appealed against. The allegation was that Gan procured two sale agreements of the vessel between Kea Maritime as seller and Trisakti Utama as buyer, which stated  different sale prices. The agreement in Kea Maritime`s possession showed the price to be $1.2m, while the agreement in Trisakti Utama`s possession showed the price as $1.3m. Teddy Salim confirmed in evidence that the contract that he signed on behalf of Trisakti Utama was for $1.3m and that the agreement for the lower sum was a forgery.<br/><br/>The trial judge made a finding of fact that the defendant had dishonestly caused there to be two agreements with the intention of retaining the difference of $100,000. However, his scheme did not bear fruit because Trisakti Utama did not complete paying the instalment payments. The undisputed facts were that the instalments were in arrears when the vessel sailed back to Singapore and was subsequently repaired, chartered out, then resold by Kea Resources. Kea Resources had proceeded with the claim on the basis that $1.3m had been paid for the vessel, but this was wrong, and there was therefore no basis for the claim. In any event, any loss in the sale price would be a loss to the sellers, Kea Maritime. Any claim for the $100,000 should therefore have been made by Kea Maritime and not Kea Resources.<br/><br/>The appellants submitted that the trial judge was wrong to assume that the respondent would be enriched by $100,000 only upon full payment of the purchase price by Trisakti Utama. They asserted that the genuine sale agreement stipulating the $1.3m purchase price provided for a $100,000 deposit to be paid. This sum represented Gan`s secret `commission`. The appellants stated that:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>When `Regal 8` was repossessed by the second appellants [Kea Resources] and all instalments forfeited by the second appellants, they suffered a loss of S$100,000 being the deposit which they would otherwise have forfeited if not for the respondent`s fraudulent misrepresentation that the price of `Regal 8` was S$1.2m instead of $1.3m. Had the respondent not dishonestly misled the second appellants, the S$100,000 deposit would have gone into the second appellants` account.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Although there is no evidence that the respondent had himself taken the sum of $100,000, the second appellants submit that following the case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society v Borders</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1941] 2 All ER 205</font>, it is sufficient to find that a tort of deceit had been committed by the respondent so long as the second appellants can show that they have suffered a loss. The second appellants have shown at para 175 above that they could not collect and forfeit the said sum due to the respondent`s fraudulent misrepresentation.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In addition, the appellants said that the trial judge was wrong to think that the claim should have been brought by Kea Maritime, and not by Kea Resources. This is because Kea Maritime would pay any sums collected from the sale of the `Regal 8` to Kea Resources without any deductions. Kea Resources were thus the `ultimate beneficiary` under the contract of sale. In this respect, they rely on the English case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ross v Caunters (a firm)</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1980]  Ch 297</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1979] 3 All ER 580</font>, a case involving solicitor`s negligence. In their view, that case is authority for the proposition that an action could be maintained against Gan because he was in sufficient `proximity` with Kea Resources, which were the real beneficiaries of the sale contract.<br/><br/>Like the trial judge, we did not disagree with the appellants that Gan had made a false representation of the price offered by Trisakti Utama for the vessel to Kea Maritime through his apparent forgeries of the two different contracts with the intention that Kea Maritime would act upon his fraudulent act. However, the elements of the tort of deceit, as set out in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society v Borders</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1941] 2 All ER 205</font>, require more than this. The tort of deceit consists of the wilful making of a false statement with the intent that the plaintiff shall act in reliance upon it and with the result that he does so act and suffers damage in consequence. This damage must be proved by the plaintiff;  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1979]  QB 333</font>.<br/><br/>It is in relation to the final requirement that the appellants` case failed. Neither Kea Resources nor Kea Maritime had actually suffered damage as a result of Gan`s actions. The appellants` basic point appeared to be that, since the deposit of $100,000 was not received by Kea Maritime, they were entitled to claim it from Gan. The difficulty with this was that there was no evidence that the $100,000 was ever paid to him or anyone else.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is trite law that the person against whom a tort has been committed must prove that he has suffered actual damage. This proposition was encapsulated by Lord Diplock in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Albacruz (Cargo Owners) v Albazero (Owners)</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1977]  AC 774</font> where he said the following:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The general rule in English law today as to the measure of damages recoverable for the invasion of a legal right, whether by breach of a contract or by commission of a tort, is that damages are compensatory. Their function is to put the person whose right has been invaded in the same position as if it had been respected so far as the award of a sum of money can do so. Such an award can readily do so in the case of mercantile contracts, since the purpose of the parties in entering into them is to make a money profit. So where the wrong for which suit is brought is the breach of a mercantile contract the measure of damages for the breach is generally the financial loss that the plaintiff has sustained by reason of the defendant`s failure to perform the contract according to its terms.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Thus, even if the appellants successfully proved that Gan had made the fraudulent misrepresentation, they failed to show that neither Kea Resources nor Kea Maritime suffered any loss, or that Gan gained a profit as a result, due to the fact that the transaction fell through for other reasons. There was nothing for Gan to compensate. Under the circumstances, any claim against him must fail and we dismiss the appeal on this issue.<br/><br/><strong><i> Claim arising from the sale of the `Orient VI` </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The facts from which this claim arose were somewhat similar to that of the sale of the `Regal 8`. The sale was between Kea Maritime as vendors and PT Ersihan Satya Pratama (`Ersihan`), a company controlled by Teddy Salim, as purchasers. Kea Resources had claimed that they were the owners of the `Orient VI`, and this was admitted by Gan.<br/><br/>Again, there were two sale agreements, one for $685,000 which was in the possession of Ersihan and another for $650,000 in the possession of Kea Maritime. Teddy Salim acknowledged that the correct price was $685,000, that it was paid by Ersihan, and that his signature on the $650,000 was a forgery.<br/><br/>The trial judge accepted Teddy Salim`s evidence that he had handed a cash cheque of $35,000 to Gan as part of the purchase price. This sum was not paid over to Kea Maritime. In this last respect, the evidence differed from the `Regal 8` claim. However, he dismissed this claim on the basis that, although Kea Resources were the owners of the vessel, they were not the vendors. Kea Maritime were the vendors and as such the party entitled to receive payment from the purchasers. The $35,000 was therefore due to Kea Maritime, but who were not the claimants. The trial judge observed that in the sale of an asset the owner is not ipso facto entitled to the proceeds of sale if it is not also the vendor. Where the vendor and the owner are separate parties, prima facie, the vendor is the party entitled to the proceeds. The owner may have a claim to the proceeds, e.g. if the vendor was selling as its agent, but there must be a basis for a claim beyond its ownership. Kea Resources had not established that in its claim.<br/><br/>The appellants argued that the trial judge erred in his view that Kea Resources could not bring the claim. They said that Kea Resources had established a basis for the claim beyond their ownership of the vessel:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The second appellants [Kea Resources] have more than one basis beyond ownership. Other than the fact that the second appellants were the owner, the second appellants were also the `ultimate beneficiary` in the sale of `Orient VI`. The loss of S$35,000 was therefore a loss to and suffered by the second appellants and not Kea Maritime. The trial judge had therefore erred by failing to take into account such evidence.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The second basis is the duty owed by the respondent to the second appellants. Such duty stems from the close and proximate relationship between the respondent and as Managing Director of the second appellants. The respondent as managing director of the second appellants owed it a duty not to cause it to suffer loss. It is foreseeable by any reasonable man that the respondent, being in such a proximate relationship with the second appellants, would foresee that the second appellants would suffer loss as a result of his fraudulent scheme.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The facts of this claim were different from the claim in respect of the `Regal 8` in that, in this case, the trial judge accepted that Gan had been paid $35,000 for the sale, which had not been paid over to Kea Maritime. On appeal, Gan also did not seriously dispute this finding. Kea Maritime was clearly entitled to bring an action for recovery of the $35,000. The difficulty faced by the appellants, however, was that Kea Maritime were not a party to this action. The trial judge accepted that Kea Resources were the owners of the vessel, but held that this was not enough - something `beyond ownership` was required.<br/><br/>As stated above, the elements of the tort of deceit are the wilful making of a false statement with the intent that the plaintiff shall act in reliance upon it and with the result that he does so act and suffers damage in consequence: <strong><i> Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society v Borders </i></strong>. It seems to us that the question of who the seller was in determining who the proper party to the suit should be is therefore not as crucial as the trial judge opined. We are unable to agree with the trial judge`s analysis of this issue. The facts show that Gan must  have made the fraudulent misrepresentation of the selling price to Kea Maritime as well as Kea Resources. This is because there was a very close relationship between Kea Resources on the one hand, who expended the money and resources to build the vessels and Kea Maritime on the other, who sold these vessels.<br/><br/>The re-re-amended statement of claim gives details of the relationship between Kea Maritime and Kea Resources and these two transactions. The relevant portion of para 32 of the re-re-amended statement of claim reads:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>32 On or about 15 November 1995, the defendant caused and/or procured the second plaintiffs [Kea Resources] to sell a vessel named `Regal 8` through M/s Kea Maritime Pte Ltd to Trisakti Utama at the price of S$1,200,000 plus 5% per annum contractual interest charges. The agreement provided that the payment for the vessel `Regal 8` was to be by way of 48 monthly instalments of S$30,000 inclusive of 5% per annum contractual interest charges, totalling S$1,440,000  </p>\n        <p>Particulars  </p>\n        <p>(a) M/s Kea Maritime Pte Ltd is a company formed on 28 September 1993 to carry on the business of selling vessels on an instalment basis where ownership of the vessels would be transferred to the buyer only upon full payment. This is different from the second plaintiffs` business which is the outright sale of vessels to buyers;  </p>\n        <p>(b) The defendant [Gan] holds 20% of the shares in M/s Kea Maritime Pte Ltd whilst the balance 80% of the shares is held by the first plaintiffs;  </p>\n        <p>...  </p>\n        <p>(d) The costs of construction of all vessels in China including the vessel `Regal 8` were borne by the second plaintiffs;  </p>\n        <p>(e) All other expenses, costs, disbursements for all vessels including the vessel `Regal 8` were also borne by the second plaintiffs;  </p>\n        <p>(f) The defendant, as a director and managing director of both the Second plaintiffs and M/s Kea Maritime Pte Ltd, knew or ought reasonably to know that all payments in connection with or related to the vessel `Regal 8` were or would be made by the second plaintiffs;  </p>\n        <p>...</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Further, it is stated that Kea Maritime would be the legal owner of the vessels until the payment of the instalments was completed by the respective buyers. The amount of proceeds received by Kea Maritime would then be transferred to Kea Resources.<br/><br/>These circumstances show that Gan`s fraudulent misrepresentation must therefore also have been made to Kea Resources. He intended that they would act upon it by entering into the transaction, which they did, and they suffered damage as a result, viz the difference in the selling price that Ersihan paid and the amount of sale proceeds that they actually received. In our view, the trial judge erred in holding that the appellants had to prove something beyond ownership in order to be entitled to claim the proceeds. The facts showed that the elements of the tort that Kea Resources claimed had been perpetuated on them by Gan had been made  out. Thus, they were entitled to bring the claim for the $35,000. We thus allow the appeal on this issue.<br/><br/><strong><i> Conclusion </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Out of the four issues on appeal, we allow the appeal on the second and fourth claims and dismiss the appeals relating to the first and third claims. Gan is thus ordered to pay over the sums of US$77,610 and $35,000 to the appellants. As the appellants are only partially successful, and in particular, lost the first issue which was by far the most hotly-contested claim, we award them one-third the costs in the appeal. We make the usual consequential order for the security deposit to be returned to the appellants or their solicitors.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n    <p>Order accordingly.<br/><br/></p>\n  </body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It relates to the construction of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe ROC\u201d) which provides for a regime of automatic discontinuance of an action in a certain specified circumstance. The appeal raises the question as to whether a statement of claim, which was filed and served out of time, should be regarded as a \u201cstep or proceeding\u201d within the meaning of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) so as to preclude the application of the rule.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another issue which the appeal raises is whether the court, on the facts of the case and in exercise of its discretion, should extend time to regularise the statement of claim which was filed and served out of time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The facts</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 24\u00a0December 2000, a casualty occurred while the vessel, <i>Melati</i>, was on its voyage from Batam, Indonesia to Huangpu and Shanghai, China. Goods carried on board had to be salvaged. The shipowners, the defendants in the present action, declared general average. The cargo owners, who are the plaintiffs in the action, provided a general average bond and a salvage guarantee to the shipowners.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 5\u00a0March 2002, the plaintiffs commenced <i>in rem</i> proceedings against the vessel <i>Melati</i>. The writ was served and the defendants entered appearance on 20\u00a0March 2002. However, no further step was taken by the plaintiffs until 18\u00a0March 2003 when a statement of claim was served on the defendants who duly objected to the service on the ground that it was served out of time and without the leave of the court. They took the view that the service could, therefore, be disregarded.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Obviously appreciating that the statement of claim served on 18\u00a0March 2003 might well be defective, the plaintiffs applied, on 4\u00a0April 2003, for an extension of time to serve the statement of claim. In the alternative, the plaintiffs applied for the action to be reinstated pursuant to O\u00a021 r\u00a02(8) of the ROC. On 24\u00a0April 2003, the assistant registrar refused the plaintiffs\u2019 application for an extension of time to serve the statement of claim and ordered that the statement of claim filed on 18\u00a0March 2003 be struck out.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs appealed to the judge in chambers. Belinda Ang Saw Ean\u00a0J held that although the statement of claim was filed and served out of time and without leave, and thus was an irregular step, it was nevertheless a \u201cstep\u201d for the purposes of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6). Ang\u00a0J regularised the irregular step by extending the time for service of the statement of claim. She also ordered that the statement of claim filed and served on 18\u00a0March 2003 was to stand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The delay in filing and serving the statement of claim on the part of the plaintiffs was caused by their decision to await the outcome of the salvors\u2019 arbitration which was then in progress in London. The plaintiffs wanted to be able to quantify the indemnity sought by them against the defendants when filing the statement of claim. While Ang\u00a0J noted that this decision of the plaintiffs to wait might not have been justifiable, she felt that this failure in filing and serving the statement of claim within the period prescribed in O\u00a018 r\u00a01 of the ROC was only an irregularity, which was curable since it did not cause the defendants any real prejudice. Ang\u00a0J explained at [16] and [17] of her judgment (reported at <nobr>[2003] 4 SLR 575</nobr>):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The only prejudice raised by the defendants is that the defendants \u2026 would be deprived of a limitation defence under the Hague Rules. This is a circular form of argument. The defendants only have a limitation defence if the application to extend time is refused or if the action has been discontinued and consequently reinstatement is sought in either event. \u2026 On 18\u00a0March 2003, it made no difference at all to the defendants whether or not the statement of claim was served out of time and without leave since any which way the defence of time bar was not available.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The grant of an order to cure the irregularity cannot be viewed as prejudicial to the defendants\u2019 interests. They still have the full opportunity to defend the action. On the other hand, a refusal of the time extension would for the plaintiffs mean an end to the action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ang\u00a0J also added that this was not a case where there was a wholesale disregard of the rules of court. There had been no breach of any court order. Being dissatisfied with her decision, the defendants have appealed to us.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants argued that the object of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) is to ensure that every action instituted in court is conducted expeditiously and efficiently. This aim must be borne in mind when the court construes the meaning of the expression \u201cstep or proceeding\u201d in O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6). In this light, an irregular step, such as a statement of claim filed and served out of time, should not and cannot be regarded as a \u201cstep or proceeding\u201d within the meaning of the rule. In any event, in the circumstances of this case, particularly having regard to the long delay, the judge should not have regularised the position by granting an extension of time to enable the plaintiffs to serve the statement of claim out of time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The meaning of \u201cstep or proceeding\u201d</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We agree with counsel for the defendants that the object of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) is to ensure that actions instituted in court should be proceeded with expeditiously and not be allowed to become dormant. Nevertheless, how the expression \u201cstep or proceeding\u201d in the rule should be construed must necessarily be viewed in the light of the other rules in the ROC.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the previous rules of court, an action could be left hanging for a long time especially where both the plaintiff and the defendant were, for their own respective reasons, happy to let the action remain dormant. All that the plaintiff needed to do to bring a dormant action to life would be to give notice to the defendant that the plaintiff intended to prosecute the action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Order\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) brought a dramatic change to all that. It was first introduced in 1996 and subsequently amended in 1999. It places the onus on the plaintiff to ensure that the action is not allowed to become dormant for more than a year. Under the scheme, the Registry need not allocate scarce manpower to police the management of cases. The plaintiff should monitor his action closely, failing which he runs the risk of the action being deemed discontinued.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The starting point in the consideration of how the expression \u201cstep or proceeding\u201d should be construed, is O\u00a018 r\u00a01 which provides that the plaintiff shall serve his statement of claim within 14 days of appearance having been entered by the defendant. Order\u00a018 r\u00a021 provides that all pleadings must be filed with the Registry. Clearly, from both these rules, the statement of claim must also be filed within the said 14 days. It seems to us that O\u00a018 r\u00a01 emphasises service because while filing and serving need not be on the same day, service must still be effected within 14 days of appearance having been entered.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next, O\u00a019 r\u00a01 provides that where the plaintiff fails to so serve his statement of claim, the defendant may apply to court to have the action dismissed. However, the defendant is not compelled to make the application. The option is his. No such application was made by the defendants in the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While there is nothing in the ROC which provides that a step or proceeding which ought to be taken within a prescribed time may not be taken thereafter, quite clearly the proper procedure would have been for that party to apply to court for an extension of time to take that step or proceeding pursuant to O\u00a03 r\u00a04. The question that arises is whether a step taken out of time, and without leave, is a nullity or is only an irregularity. Counsel for the defendants did not contend that the filing of the statement of claim and its service on the defendants on 18\u00a0March 2003 were nullities. We think he is correct to regard the statement of claim served on the defendants as an irregularity and this is explicitly recognised in O\u00a02 r\u00a01(1) which reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where</span></i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings or <i>at any stage in the course of</i> or in connection with <i>any proceedings</i>, there <i>has, by reason of anything done or left undone, been a failure to comply with the requirements of these Rules</i>, whether <i>in respect of time</i>, place, manner, form or content or in any other respect, <i>the failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings</i>, any step taken in the proceedings, or any document, judgment or order therein. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The failure as regards the statement of claim, filed and served by the plaintiffs on the defendants on 18\u00a0March 2003, was in respect of time. Thus, pursuant to O\u00a02 r\u00a01(1), the step taken by the plaintiffs is accordingly only an irregularity, not a nullity.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is common ground between the parties that what we are concerned with is whether the irregular filing and/or service of the statement of claim on 18\u00a0March 2003 is a \u201cstep\u201d within the meaning of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6). Neither O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6), nor any other rule in the ROC, defines this term. Some of the difficulties relating to the words \u201cstep\u201d and \u201cproceeding\u201d are raised in the article entitled \u201cAutomatic Discontinuance under Order\u00a021 Rule\u00a02 \u2013 First Dormant, Then Dead \u2026\u201d by Ms\u00a0Lim Hui Min, published at (2001) 13 SAcLJ 150. While there may be difficulties in determining whether some acts would constitute \u201csteps\u201d or \u201cproceedings\u201d within the meaning of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6), there can be no doubt that the filing of a statement of claim with the Registry is a \u201cstep\u201d as it is clearly an act to move the action forward towards resolution.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The thrust of the defendants\u2019 argument here is that an irregular step should not be regarded as a \u201cstep\u201d within the meaning of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6). In this connection, references were made by counsel for the defendants to various policy statements made by the Minister for Law and the Chief Justice (in non-judicial contexts) in relation to the object of the scheme under the rule. The defendants averred that the court should not readily accept arguments which would have the effect of diluting the draconian effect of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6). It was submitted that O\u00a02 r\u00a01 does not elevate an irregular \u201cstep\u201d to the level of a proper and regular step.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this juncture, it may be expedient to look at the manner in which the ROC deal with an irregularity. Order\u00a02 r\u00a01(2) reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Subject to paragraph\u00a0(3), <i>the Court may</i>, on the ground that there has been such a failure as is mentioned in paragraph\u00a0(1), and on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks just, <i>set aside</i> either wholly or in part the proceedings in which the failure occurred, <i>any step taken in those proceedings</i> or any document, judgment or order therein or <i>exercise its powers under these Rules to allow such amendments (if any) to be made and to make such order (if any) dealing with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The combined effect of O\u00a02 r\u00a01(1) and r\u00a01(2) is that a step or proceeding, though taken out of time, is to be treated as regular unless set aside. There is effectively a presumption of validity in favour of the irregular step. As was held in <i>Metroinvest Ansalt v Commercial Union Assurance Co Ltd</i> <nobr>[1985] 1 WLR 513</nobr> (\u201c<i>Metroinvest Ansalt</i>\u201d), an irregular order or proceeding continues to operate until it is successfully set aside. The initiative to have the irregular step set aside must be taken by the other party. Until that is done, and an order to the contrary is made by the court, the step or proceeding taken is valid. Thus, it follows that with the statement of claim being filed and served by the plaintiffs on the defendants on 18\u00a0March 2003, the period of one year prescribed by O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) ceased to run as from that date. While it is true that the period 20\u00a0March 2002 to 18\u00a0March 2003 is just two days short of a year, the fact remains that the prescribed condition is not satisfied and so O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) is not triggered. For the reasons alluded to later, an irregular step, unless and until it is set aside, is nevertheless a \u201cstep\u201d for the purposes of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before we turn to address the next issue, we ought to touch on another point canvassed by the parties. It would be recalled that O\u00a018 r\u00a01 lays down that service of the statement of claim must be effected within 14 days of appearance having been entered by the defendant. Order\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) refers to \u201cany step or proceeding in the action \u2026 that appears from records maintained by the Court\u201d. In a fact situation like the present, where the filing and service of the statement of claim both occurred on the same day, it does not really matter whether it is the filing or the service of the statement of claim which is the \u201cstep\u201d for the purposes of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6). However, where the \u201cfiling\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d were not carried out on the same day, the consequences could be different, depending on whether it was the \u201cfiling\u201d or \u201cservice\u201d which constituted a step for the purposes of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the defendants argued that the \u201cfiling\u201d of a statement of claim could not be a \u201cstep\u201d within the meaning of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6). This was because a filing of the statement of claim <i>per se</i>, without service on the other party, would not move the case forward. And if \u201cfiling\u201d alone sufficed to constitute a \u201cstep\u201d, then the plaintiff could simply file without serving it on the defendant, thus buying himself another 12 months to procrastinate. Thus, the object of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) could all too easily be circumvented.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, there is the judgment of Prakash\u00a0J in <i>Moguntia-Est Epices SA v Sea-Hawk Freight Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2003] 4 SLR 429</nobr>, where she appears to have held that it was the \u201cfiling\u201d and not the \u201cservice\u201d which ought to be reckoned with. This was because the \u201cservice\u201d of a writ (or in the present case, of a statement of claim) would not be \u201crecorded in the court\u2019s record\u201d and O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) expressly provided that the \u201cstep\u201d for the purposes of the rule should appear from the \u201crecords maintained by the Court\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While we appreciate the force of the argument of the defendants, we cannot ignore the explicit words of O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) that the \u201cstep\u201d must be one which appears from the records maintained by the court. Thus, we endorse the views expressed by Prakash\u00a0J in <i>Moguntia-Est Epices</i>.\u00a0 Moreover, we think the argument that this interpretation would give rise to abuse is probably a little exaggerated. In our opinion, the cause for concern is more apparent than real. Take the example given by counsel for the defendants, of a plaintiff who, having filed his statement of claim, delayed serving it. In this situation, if the defendant were vigilant, as he should be, he would, upon the expiry of the 12-month period, have taken up with the plaintiff that the action had already been deemed discontinued under O\u00a021 r\u00a02(6) since he would have been unaware of the mere filing of the statement of claim. At that point, everything would have come to light and the plaintiff would have had to apply to court to obtain leave to serve the statement of claim out of time and he would have had to adequately explain why the pleading was not served at the time it was filed. If it appeared to the court that the filing without service was just a ploy to buy more time, the court would be entitled to refuse leave to serve the pleading out of time and to also strike out the pleadings already filed. The court has sufficient arsenal to deal with a party who abuses its process. We seriously doubt there would be many litigants who would deliberately take such a risk and put the court\u2019s patience to the test.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Exercise of discretion to regularise the service</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have, in [19] above, quoted O\u00a02 r\u00a01(2) which sets out the power of the court to deal with an irregular step. The rule does not prescribe the parameters as to how, or the circumstances under which, the discretion should be exercised. When the English equivalent of our O\u00a02 r\u00a01 was first introduced in England, Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR said in <i>Harkness v Bell\u2019s Asbestos and Engineering Ltd</i> <nobr>[1967] 2 QB 729</nobr> at 735:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This new rule does away with the old distinction between nullities and irregularities. Every omission or mistake in practice or procedure is henceforward to be regarded as an irregularity which the court can and should rectify so long as it can do so without injustice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Metroinvest Anstalt</i>, Cumming-Bruce\u00a0LJ, in commenting on how the court should exercise its powers under O\u00a02 r\u00a01 (2), said (at 521) :</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I would say that in most cases the way in which the court exercises its powers under Ord\u00a02 r\u00a01(2) is likely to depend upon whether it appears that the opposite party has suffered prejudice as a direct consequence of the particular irregularity, that is to say, the particular failure to comply with the rules. But I would construe Ord\u00a02 r\u00a01(2) as being so framed as to give the court the widest possible power in order to do justice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This view of Cumming-Bruce\u00a0LJ was endorsed by a later Court of Appeal decision in <i>The Goldean Mariner</i> [1990] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 215. Of course, we should remind ourselves of the caution uttered by Lloyd\u00a0LJ in <i>The Goldean Mariner</i> (at 219) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]hough prejudice is always a factor to be taken into account, absence of prejudice is by no means conclusive in favour of the plaintiffs: see <i>Leal v Dunlop Bio-Processes</i>, where Lord Justice Stephenson said that though the defendants had suffered no prejudice, nevertheless the mistake was not an irregularity fit to be cured under O\u00a02, r\u00a01; see also <i>Metroinvest Ansalt v Commercial Union Assurance Co Ltd,</i> <nobr>[1985] 1 WLR 513</nobr> at p\u00a0521, where Lord Justice Cumming-Bruce said that the discretion to set aside proceedings is not confined to cases where the defendant has suffered prejudice, although that will usually be so.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>The Goldean Mariner,</i> some of the defendants were served with copies of the writ which were intended for different defendants, although each of the defendants so served was in fact named as a defendant. The English Court of Appeal, reversing the first instance judge, treated the defective service as an irregularity and did not set it aside. With respect to another defendant who was served with only a form of acknowledgment of service, again, the court (on this point by majority) refused to set aside the service. The rationale for the court\u2019s decision was that there was no real prejudice to the defendants.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ang\u00a0J quite rightly indicated that the issue here revolved round the question of whether the time for service of the statement of claim should be extended. She recognised that in each case, the tension was between the efficient administration of justice on the one hand and the effect the granting of relief would have on the parties on the other hand, but always bearing in mind that the paramount consideration was to ensure that justice was done between the parties. In coming to her conclusion that the plaintiffs were not sleeping on their claim, the judge alluded to the following circumstances (at [12]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The plaintiffs filed on 26\u00a0May 2003 an affidavit deposed by Matthew Robinson, a case handler with W K Webster Co Ltd who are claims recovery agents for the plaintiffs, to explain why it took the plaintiffs 11 months to serve the statement of claim. Mr\u00a0Robinson explained that it was not unusual for parties to agree to solve the salvage claim before the main cargo claim. A protective writ was issued since the defendants refused their request to extend suit time. The salvage claim took some time to resolve. The salvors had problems getting up their claim. The salvors took their first step towards arbitration in October 2002. The arbitration fixed for hearing on 3\u00a0February 2003 was adjourned by consent to 7\u00a0February 2003. Eventually, the arbitration in London involving the bills of lading in this action was settled amongst the defendants as shipowners, salvors and the plaintiffs as cargo interests on 17\u00a0February 2003. After that, instructions were given to the lawyers in Singapore to prepare the statement of claim. It was served without thinking of obtaining leave of court or consent of the defendants under O\u00a03 r\u00a04(3).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we have cited, in [7] above, Ang\u00a0J also did not think that the irregular service caused any prejudice to the defendants. On the other hand, she felt that to refuse relief in the present case would be a disproportionately harsh response to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to file and serve the statement of claim in a timely manner, as the plaintiffs would be forever precluded from pursuing their claim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants took issue with the judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs always had the intention to pursue their claim. They questioned how it could reasonably be found that there was such an intention where the other party did nothing for almost one whole year. What we find to be significant is the fact that, as soon as the arbitration proceedings were finally concluded in London, the plaintiffs forthwith filed and served their statement of claim. This corroborated their assertion that they were waiting for the final quantification so that the appropriate sum could be included in the statement of claim. Of course, they need not have waited. The fact is that, rightly or wrongly, they did. So, we do not accept the defendants\u2019 argument that the judge was wrong to have found that the plaintiffs had, at all times, the intention to pursue the action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants next contended that the approach adopted by the judge is out of sync with the modern thinking on court administration. They relied, in particular, on the following passage of Lord Woolf\u00a0MR in <i>Arbuthnot Latham Bank Ltd v Trafalgar Holdings Ltd</i> [1998] 2\u00a0All ER 181 at 191:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In <i>Birkett v James</i> [<nobr>[1978] AC 297</nobr>] the consequence to other litigants and to the courts of inordinate delay was not a consideration which was in issue. From now on it is going to be a consideration of increasing significance. Litigants and their legal advisers, must therefore recognise that any delay which occurs from now on will be assessed not only from the point of view of the prejudice caused to the particular litigants whose case it is, but also in relation to the effect it can have on other litigants who are wishing to have their cases heard and the prejudice which is caused to the due administration of civil justice. The existing rules do contain time limits which are designed to achieve the disposal of litigation within a reasonable time scale.\u00a0 Those rules should be observed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They submitted that the court, in exercising its discretion to extend time, should look beyond the issue as to whether the other party would suffer any prejudice as a result of any extension to be granted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no one test or criterion which can be decisive in answering the question of whether an extension of time should be granted. It will always be a balancing exercise involving a consideration of all relevant factors such as the nature of the act which was not fulfilled, the reason for the failure, the prejudice which an extension will cause and any other extenuating circumstances. If observing timelines is all important, from which there can be no deviation, the rules of court would not have provided for the possibility of the court granting an extension of time. In <i>The Mortgage Corporation Ltd v Sandoes</i> (1996) 141\u00a0SJ LB 30, the English Court of Appeal recognised the principle that the plaintiff should not ordinarily be denied an adjudication of his claim on its merits merely because of a procedural default, unless the default causes prejudice to the opposing party for which an award of costs is not adequate to compensate that party. However, it also recognised that this rule should not be applied rigidly. Otherwise, it would mean that a well-to-do plaintiff could flout the rules with impunity. Thus, the ultimate decision would depend on all the circumstances of the case. The facts must be sufficient to persuade the court that granting indulgence in favour of the party in default would not be out of place.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants submitted that, in this case, there was a very blatant disregard by the plaintiffs of the timelines. They emphasised that they did not, in any way, induce the plaintiffs into not complying with the ROC. The fault was entirely that of the plaintiffs and the defendants could not be said to be seeking a tactical advantage from the failure of the plaintiffs to comply with the timelines.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While it cannot be denied that the plaintiffs were late by almost 11 and a half months in filing and serving the statement of claim, we also share Ang\u00a0J\u2019s view that the delay was not because the plaintiffs had no serious intention to pursue the action. The plaintiffs and the defendants were both, together with the salvors, actively involved in the arbitration proceedings in London to determine the amount due to the salvors which, in turn, would have a direct bearing on what the plaintiffs were entitled to claim against the defendants. Even if the plaintiffs were to have filed a holding statement of claim in time in order to comply with the rules, it would probably not have been expedient for the action to proceed further before the arbitration was concluded. Thus, there would, in any case, have been a delay in bringing the action to trial. Of course, the correct thing which the plaintiffs should have done would have been to file an application to court to ask for an extension of time to file the statement of claim, before the time expired. They did not do that.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even under the present rule of case management, it does not follow that every non-compliance should necessarily lead to the striking out of a claim or a defence. As indicated before, the entire circumstances must be carefully considered, including the nature of the step that should have been taken but was not, the reason for the non-compliance, the likelihood of prejudice to the other party, its effect on the due administration of justice and any other extenuating circumstances. A plaintiff should, except for sufficient grounds, have his claim adjudicated upon by the court on its merits and not be defeated by some non-compliance with procedural requirements. On the other hand, the situation involving the filing of a notice of appeal out of time should be distinguished: see <i>The Tokai Maru</i> <nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 105</nobr> at [20] and [23]. Where a notice of appeal is involved, there is already an adjudication by the court and if a losing party is dissatisfied, he should file his notice of appeal within the prescribed time. The paramount consideration there is the need for finality.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For all the aforesaid reasons, we do not think the judge was in error in exercising her discretion to grant an extension of time and to regularise an otherwise defective service.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the premises, we would dismiss the appeal with costs and with the usual consequential orders.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n

      </i>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These are two appeals which raised before us an identical issue, namely, whether each of the two separate actions instituted in Singapore by the respondent, UCO Bank (\u201cUCO\u201d), against two shipowners, the appellants in the two appeals, for their wrongful delivery of cargo without the production of the relevant bills of lading (B/L), should be stayed on the ground that there is an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the B/Ls in favour of India.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Except in one respect which we need not go into, the facts surrounding the two actions are similar.\u00a0 Accordingly, the parties have argued before us on the basis that the ruling in Civil Appeal 55/2003 will apply to Civil Appeal 53/2003.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The background</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UCO is an Indian bank carrying on business here through a local branch.\u00a0 One of its customers was SOM International Pte Ltd (\u201cSOM\u201d), a Singapore incorporated company.\u00a0 SOM was controlled by Mr Som Nath Sood (\u201cSood\u201d).\u00a0 SOM arranged for cargoes to be shipped from various East Malaysian ports to the Port of Kandla in India.\u00a0 One set of cargo was loaded on board the <i>\u201cAsean Pioneer\u201d</i> owned by Golden Shore Transportation Pte Ltd (\u201cGolden Shore\u201d), the appellants in CA 55/2003.\u00a0 The appropriate B/Ls were issued for the shipment (\u201coriginal bills\u201d).\u00a0 Each\u00a0 B/L expressly stated on the front page that it is governed by the law of Singapore and the consignee is \u201cto the order of UCO Bank\u201d.\u00a0 The parties to be notified were SOM and UCO.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to the application of SOM, letters of credit were issued by UCO to the sellers of the cargo.\u00a0 UCO eventually became the holders of the B/Ls.\u00a0 However, around the same time, SOM procured the issuance of a second set of B/Ls (\u201cswitched bills\u201d) by promising to the shipowner, Golden Shore, that the original bills would be returned to them.\u00a0 In the switched bills, SOM was named as the shipper, instead of SOM\u2019s suppliers.\u00a0 However, the original bills, which were held by UCO, were never returned to Golden Shore as promised by SOM.\u00a0 SOM never paid UCO to obtain the original bills.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present action of UCO against Golden Shore is based entirely on the original bills which are still in their possession.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The switched bills were transferred by SOM to buyers in India.\u00a0 The vessel, <i>Asean Pioneer,</i> arrived at its destination on 15 January 2001 and the cargo was, between 15 and 25 January 2001, delivered to Indian receivers upon presentation of the switched bills.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After some six months, Golden Shore asked for the return of the original bills but UCO refused.\u00a0 UCO did not at any time, prior to this request for the return of the original bills, enquire about the shipment or ask for the delivery of the cargo.\u00a0 At the same time, UCO repeatedly asked SOM for repayment of the loan.\u00a0 On 20 December 2001, UCO, as holders of the B/L, instituted the present action.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 11 January 2002, Golden Shore applied to have the action stayed on the ground that clause 17 of the B/L, which is an exclusive jurisdiction clause, required that any dispute between the parties has to be adjudicated upon at the port of delivery.\u00a0 The application first came before the Assistant Registrar, who ordered a stay.\u00a0 On appeal, the judge-in-chambers (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), reversed that order and refused a stay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Decision below</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before the High Court, two main issues arose for consideration.\u00a0 The first was whether clause 17 is, in fact, an exclusive jurisdiction clause.\u00a0 The second was, if the answer to the first issue was in the affirmative, whether there are exceptional circumstances indicating \u201cstrong cause\u201d, such that the court should exercise its discretion in UCO\u2019s favour and assist them in breaching the exclusive jurisdiction clause.\u00a0 The Judge answered both issues in the affirmative and refused to order a stay of the present proceeding.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Jurisdictional Clause</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, the same two issues were canvassed and we shall deal with each in turn.\u00a0 As the question on the scope of clause 17 is one of construction, it is necessary that we set it out in full in order that its effect could be appreciated:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Claims.\u00a0 Any claims that may arise hereunder must be made at the port of delivery <i>for determination</i> and settlement at that port only.\u00a0 The Carrier\u2019s liability in case of loss or damage to goods for which they are responsible within the limits of this Bill of Lading to be calculated on and in no case to exceed the net invoice cost and disbursement or pro rata on that basis in the event of partial loss or damage.\u00a0 Unless <i>notice of loss or damage</i> and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the Carrier or their agents at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, or if, the loss or damage be not apparent, within three days, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the Carrier of the goods as described in the Bill of Lading.\u00a0 In any event, the Carrier shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless <i>suit</i> is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In no circumstances shall liability exceed the actual loss or damage sustained, the carrier shall not be liable for any consequential or special damages and shall have the option of replacing any lost or damaged goods.\u00a0 Any sum paid to or recovered by Customs Authorities under any Bond for exportation given by the shippers or owners of goods shall not be considered to form part of any actual loss or damage sustained by or in connection with such goods for which the carrier is or shall be liable.\u00a0 If the ship comes into collision with another ship as a result of the negligence of the other ship or object and any act, neglect or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the Carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship, the owners of the goods carried hereunder will indemnify the Carrier against all loss or liability to the other or non-carrying ship or object or the owners in so far as such loss or liability represents loss of, or damage to, any <i>claim</i> whatsoever of the owners of said goods, paid or payable by the other non-carrying ship or object or her owners to the owners of said goods and set off, recouped or recovered by the other or non-carrying ship or object or her\u00a0 owners as part of their claim against the carrying ship or Carrier.\u00a0 At any port where, in accordance with Customs regulations, the goods have to be landed into the charge of the Customs or other Authorities no <i>claims</i> for shortage or damage will be considered by the Carrier, beyond that noted by the Authorities at the time of receiving the goods into their charge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage, the Carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.\u00a0 The carrier shall not be liable to pay any compensation if the nature or the value of the goods has been wilfully mistated.\u00a0 The above includes <i>claims</i> in the nature of General Average.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This clause in its entirety shall also apply in any cause of loss sustained as a result of mis-delivery, non-delivery, wrongful delivery or delivery to any person whomsoever not entitled to the goods.\u00a0 (Emphasis added).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that this clause is unlike some other jurisdiction clauses which we see in other cases.\u00a0 As an example, in <i>The Jian He</i> [2000] 1 SLR, a case which featured very prominently in the arguments of both parties, the jurisdiction clause read:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cJurisdiction:\u00a0 This Bill of Lading is governed by the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 All disputes arising under or in connection with this Bill \u2026 shall be determined by the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China and any action against the carrier shall be brought before the Maritime Court in Guangzhou or Shanghai or Tianjin or Qingdao or Dalian where the principal place of business of the relevant company is situated.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It cannot be denied that this clause in <i>The Jian He</i> is more explicit and there it was not really in dispute that the clause was an exclusive jurisdictional clause.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, in <i>The Asian Plutus</i> <nobr>[1990] SLR 543</nobr>, the jurisdiction clause was also very explicit and it read:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThe contract evidenced by or contained in this bill of lading shall be governed by Japanese law, except as may be otherwise provided for herein and any action against the carrier thereunder shall be brought before the Tokyo District Court in Japan.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, it does not therefore follow that, just because the clause here is worded differently, it could not be such an exclusive jurisdiction clause.\u00a0 It is still necessary to construe the clause in its entirety to determine its real import.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Contentions of UCO</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main argument of UCO is that, looking at the clause as a whole, what it provides for is the place for \u201cthe notification and making of a claim for the purposes of the owner\u2019s consideration and settlement.\u201d\u00a0 In this regard, UCO relied on the opening words of the clause \u201cclaims \u2026 must be made at the port of delivery for determination and settlement at that port only.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UCO also relied upon the word \u201csuit\u201d which appear later in the same paragraph of clause 17 to contend that the word \u201cclaim\u201d in the opening sentence of that clause could not have been intended to mean \u201csuit\u201d.\u00a0 They\u00a0 submitted that it is a canon of construction that where different words are used in a document, they could not be construed to mean the same thing; a \u201csuit\u201d would connote a legal process and a \u201cclaim\u201d does not necessarily connote that.\u00a0 It is entirely in line with common sense and practicality for a claim to be notified at the port of delivery.\u00a0 UCO argued that it is altogether another thing to say that just because a claim must be made at the port of delivery, an action must also be instituted at the same place.\u00a0 One does not necessarily follow from the other.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, UCO argued that if indeed \u201cclaim\u201d means \u201csuit\u201d and if we were to substitute the word \u201csuit\u201d for the word \u201cclaim\u201d in the clause, it will not make sense in some places.\u00a0 UCO took, <i>inter alia</i>, the example of the phrase \u201cno claims for shortage or damage will be considered by the carrier\u201d and argue that if the word \u201cclaims\u201d were to be substituted by \u201csuits\u201d, the phrase would not make sense.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UCO also referred to clause 6 to argue that clause 17 does not relate to the institution of proceedings. Clause 6 provides that \u201c\u2026 claims for services by other vessels belonging to the carrier, wherever rendered, may be adjudicated upon in the Singapore Court whose decisions shall bind the owners of the goods \u2026\u201d\u00a0 In contrast, clause 17 does not mention courts or adjudication.\u00a0 Thus, clause 17 could not be a jurisdiction clause.\u00a0 \u201cClaims\u201d means nothing more than notification of loss or damage and the entire clause deals with notification and consideration of claims.\u00a0 It has nothing to do with the institution of legal proceedings.\u00a0 In any event if there is any ambiguity as to the scope of clause 17, the <i>contra proferentum rule</i> should apply.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Arguments of Shipowners</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Golden Shore adopted the interpretation accepted by the judge below, that the word \u201cclaims\u201d in the first sentence of clause 17 includes \u201csuits\u201d.\u00a0 But they explained that not every reference to \u201cclaim\u201d in clause 17 would necessarily include a suit; much would depend on the context.\u00a0 Golden Shore referred to the sentence \u201cno claims for shortage or damage will be considered by the carrier.\u201d\u00a0 The word \u201cclaims\u201d in that context could not mean \u201csuits\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Golden Shore argued that sufficient regard must be given to the two key words in the first sentence of clause 17: \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201cdetermination\u201d. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d means \u201cadjudication\u201d.\u00a0 That sentence required all suits under the B/L to be determined at the port of delivery only.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The authorities</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Golden Shore relied upon the case of <i>Maharani Woollen Mills Co v Anchor Line</i> [1927] 29 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 169 <i>(\u201cMaharani\u201d</i>) in support of its construction of clause 17.\u00a0 There the clause in question provided that \u201cAll claims arising shall be determined at the port of destination according to British laws.\u201d\u00a0 The goods were carried from Liverpool to Bombay.\u00a0 The plaintiff brought an action in England.\u00a0 But the shipowners asserted that the action must be instituted in Bombay and sought a stay.\u00a0 The High Court ordered a stay, which order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\u00a0 Scrutton LJ, the illustrious shipping law judge, in a short judgment, construed this clause to mean that \u201cdisputes as to the condition of the goods and the damage done to them shall be settled where the goods \u2026 are.\u201d\u00a0 He said that he did not see any difficulty with the jurisdiction clause and it was reasonable to hold the plaintiff to his contractual term.\u00a0 He construed the word \u201cclaims\u201d to include \u201cdisputes\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast, UCO relied upon the Malaysian case of <i>The Sinar Mas</i> <nobr>[1982] 1 MLJ 279</nobr> for the construction of clause 17.\u00a0 There the clause was very similar to the present clause 17 and it read: \u201cClaims. Any claims that may arise hereunder must be made at the port of delivery for determination and settlement at that port only \u2026\u201d\u00a0 The High Court construed this clause to have nothing to do with jurisdiction and its reasoning was as follows:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cIn <i>Shorter Oxford Dictionary</i>, \u201cclaims\u201d means a demand for something as due; an assertion of a right to something.\u00a0 In my view, a claim in the context of Clause 17 does not amount to a litigation which, according to the same dictionary, means the action of carrying on a suit in law or equity; legal proceedings; and disputation.\u00a0 Having regard to the judgments in <i>The Fehmarn</i> and <i>The Adolf Warski</i>, I think there is a distinction between \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201cdisputes\u201d.\u00a0 Clause 17 does not envisage any dispute on litigation.\u00a0 It is confined to \u201cclaims\u201d pure and simple as, for example, where a consignee wishes to claim for the goods under the Bill of Lading, then it must be done only in Kuching, which is the port of delivery.\u00a0 I am, therefore, of the view that Clause 17 is not a jurisdiction clause or even a forum clause.\u00a0 The court should not import extra words into Clause 17 so as to give it new meaning with regard to the intention of the contracting parties.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As pointed out by the Judge, the court in <i>The Sinar Mas</i> did not give consideration to the word \u201cdetermination\u201d in that clause.\u00a0 Furthermore, it is not clear why the court in <i>The Sinar Mas</i> relied upon <i>The Fehmarn</i> [1958] 1 All ER 333 and <i>The Adolf Warski</i> [1976] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 107.\u00a0 In <i>The Fehmarn,</i> the relevant condition was:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cAll claims and disputes arising under and in connexion with the bills of exchange shall be judged in the USSR.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The dispute was in relation to short delivery and contamination.\u00a0 The Court of Appeal there did not examine the two words \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201cdisputes\u201d.\u00a0 What can be said about that clause is that the parties there had expressly used both terms.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, in <i>The Adolf Warski</i>, Brandon J was in no sense construing the two words \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201cdispute\u201d.\u00a0 The case concerned two jurisdiction clauses in two different bills of lading.\u00a0 The first provided that \u201cAny claim \u2026 shall at the option of the carriers be settled direct with the carriers in Poland according to the Polich law to the exclusion of proceedings in the courts of any other country\u201d.\u00a0 The second provided that \u201cany dispute \u2026 to be decided in Poland according to Polish law except as provided elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0 There was no doubt that these two clauses were jurisdiction clauses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are unable to see how these two cases, <i>The</i> <i>Fehmarn</i> and <i>The Adolf Warski</i>, were germane to the interpretation of the jurisdiction clause in <i>The Sinar Mas</i>.\u00a0 While it is clear that the word \u201cclaim\u201d and the word \u201cdispute\u201d are different, what each word means must depend on its context.\u00a0 For example, in the clause \u201cany claim \u2026 shall \u2026 be settled direct with the carriers in Poland according to the Polish law to the exclusion of proceedings in the courts of any other country\u201d in <i>The Adolf Warski</i>, the word \u201cclaim\u201d would surely include \u201cdispute\u201d.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would observe that the result reached in <i>The Sinar Mas</i> would also\u00a0 have been the same even if the court were to have held that the clause was an exclusive jurisdiction clause.\u00a0 This is because, as the judge there noted, the clause could not be invoked in the circumstances of the case.\u00a0 The contention there was that the action should have been filed in the Kuching High Court instead of the Kuala Lumpur High Court.\u00a0 The judge effectively ruled there was no difference.\u00a0 He said (at 279):-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThe carriage by sea was from Penang to Kuching.\u00a0 Both ports are in Malaysia \u2026 The High Courts in Borneo and States of Malaya have similar jurisdiction and adopt the same admiralty practice.\u00a0 I am inclined to the view that a jurisdiction or forum clause does not apply to a litigation commenced in another court of similar jurisdiction and situated in the same country as the court envisaged by the parties to the contract.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another case which has been referred to by the parties is <i>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 253</nobr>, a decision of this Court.\u00a0 We do not think this case is helpful either.\u00a0 There two adjacent clauses in an insurance policy read: \u201cClaims are payable in India or Singapore in US dollars\u201d and \u201cIn the event of loss or damages which may involve a claim under this insurance, immediate notice thereof and application for survey should be given to: (agents in India)\u201d\u00a0 The court rejected the suggestion that the first clause amounted to a jurisdiction clause. \u00a0 The wording there is clearly different from that in the first sentence of our clause 17.\u00a0 Moreover, in relation to an insurance claim, notification to the insurer is a standard feature to enable the insurer to conduct investigations.\u00a0 While we recognise that it is just as important for a carrier to conduct investigation into a claim for loss or damage to cargo, there is no compelling reason why the carrier must be notified at the port of delivery.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another case Golden Shore relied upon is <i>The Media</i> [1931] 41 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 80, where the clause read:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cAll claims arising under this bill of lading shall be determined at the port of destination of the goods according to British law, or, at the shipowners\u2019 option, they shall be determined in the UK, and to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of any other country.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There was no dispute in the case that that was an exclusive jurisdiction clause, with only one exception, that the shipowner would have the option to have any dispute determined in the UK.\u00a0 What is of interest about the clause is that its first half is similar to the first sentence of clause 17 in the present case.\u00a0 However, we recognise the last limb of the clause in <i>The Media</i> removed any possible doubt that it was a jurisdiction clause.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Our opinion</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Though the clauses in <i>Maharani</i> and <i>The Media</i> are not identical with clause 17, as there is no reference in clause 17 itself to governing law, or the exclusion of the jurisdiction of another country, they are similar in significant respects.\u00a0 In both <i>Maharani</i> and <i>The Media</i>, the word \u201cclaims\u201d was effectively held to encompass \u201csuits\u201d or \u201cdisputes\u201d.\u00a0 A \u201cclaim\u201d means a demand for something as due or an assertion of a right to something.\u00a0 A claim can be manifested in various forms.\u00a0 It can take the form of a letter or an action.\u00a0 There is no reason why a claim in the form of an action or suit could not come within the meaning of the first sentence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another word of importance in the first sentence is \u201cdetermination\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 To suggest that the sentence only imports the concepts of\u00a0 \u201cnotification\u201d and \u201cinvestigation\u201d is to ignore the plain words there and give no sense at all to it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning to the argument on the last sentence of the first paragraph of clause 17 where the word \u201csuit\u201d appeared, we would say it reinforces the view that the scope of the first sentence is much wider than just \u201cnotification\u201d and \u201cinvestigation\u201d.\u00a0 At this juncture, it may be instructive to see what the second and third sentences in the paragraph say.\u00a0 The second sentence puts a cap as to the carrier\u2019s liability for loss or damage.\u00a0 The third sentence deems the goods delivered in proper condition unless notification was given at the time of delivery or within three days (if the loss or damage be not apparent).\u00a0 We should think that with this sentence there would have been no need to have the first sentence if all that the first sentence means is to give \u201cnotification\u201d.\u00a0 The fourth sentence (which is also the last sentence) of the paragraph prescribes a limitation period of one year.\u00a0 As the Judge rightly found, the word \u201csuit\u201d was more appropriate in the context of that last sentence.\u00a0 Indeed the second, third and fourth sentences were adopted from clause 6 of the Hague Rules.\u00a0 The three sentences either cap or qualify the liability of the carrier.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for clause 6 of the B/L, while it is true that there there is an express reference to adjudication by the Singapore courts, what is of interest to note is that the clause also uses the word \u201cclaims\u201d and in the context the word \u201cclaims\u201d would encompass \u201cactions\u201d or \u201cdisputes\u201d, precisely the sort of meaning which UCO sought to place on the word \u201cclaims\u201d in clause 17.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, we agree with the trial judge that the word \u201cclaims\u201d in the first sentence should be construed to include \u201csuits\u201d, and in our opinion even \u201cdisputes\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 A claim which is not met becomes a dispute which would require determination.\u00a0 We would reiterate that if the first sentence is only meant to provide for notification, as contended by UCO, why have it at all when the third sentence clearly provides for notification.\u00a0 Moreover, that contention would have disregarded the word \u201cdetermination\u201d.\u00a0 Accordingly, we hold that the first sentence is an exclusive jurisdiction clause.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Whether a stay should be ordered</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is settled law that where a party seeks to bring an action in a Singapore court in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause, he must show exceptional circumstances amounting to \u201cstrong cause\u201d why the court should exercise its discretion in his favour and assist him in breaching his promise to bring the action in the contractual forum: see <i>The Jian He</i> <nobr>[2000] 1 SLR 8</nobr>.\u00a0 The burden to show such strong cause obviously rests with the plaintiff, because <i>prima facie</i> he should be held to his contractual commitment.\u00a0 The factors which a court will take into account in determining whether there is a \u201cstrong cause\u201d were elaborated in <i>The El Amria</i> [1981] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 119 and adopted by this court in <i>Amerco Timbers Pte Ltd v Chatworth Timber Corp Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1977] 2 MLJ 181</nobr>.\u00a0 They are:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0 In what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated or more readily available, and the effect of that on the relative convenience and expense of trial as between the Singapore and foreign courts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0 Whether the law of the foreign court applies and, if so, whether it differs from Singapore law in any material respects.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0 With what country either party is connected and, if so, how closely.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0 Whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural advantages.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0 Whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign court because they would:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(i)\u00a0 be deprived of security for their claim;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(ii)\u00a0 be unable to enforce any judgment obtained;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(iii)\u00a0 be faced with a time-bar not applicable here;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0 or</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(iv)\u00a0 for political, racial, religious or other reasons</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be unlikely to get a fair trial.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0 The burden here is more than just establishing that Singapore is the more convenient forum to hear the case.\u00a0 The principles applicable to a case involving an exclusive jurisdiction clause are different from those applicable to determining <i>forum non conveniens</i>: see <i>Citi-March Ltd v Neptune Orient Lines Ltd</i> [1997] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 72 at 76 per Colman J.\u00a0 As this Court noted in <i>The Vishva Apurva</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 175</nobr> at 182:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cIn a case involving an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the discretion of the court should not be exercised just by balancing the conveniences.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this case, the factors which the judge took into account in coming to his conclusion that there is strong cause for refusing a stay are \u2013</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><font size=\"5\">(i)\u00a0 that both parties were more closely connected with Singapore;</font></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(ii) that Singapore law is the governing law under the B/L;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(iii)\u00a0 that in respect of the main issue as to whether UCO had consented or acquiesced in the switching of the B/L such as to preclude them from relying on the original bills, the evidence is primarily to be found in Singapore; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(iv)\u00a0 that Golden Shore did not genuinely desire trial in India</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We should add that another factor which the judge had considered, but ruled that it is neutral, is the fact that the action has become time-barred in India.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Golden Shore, in reliance on, <i>inter alia</i>, <i>British Aerospace v Dee Howard</i> [1993] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 368, <i>Import Export Metro Ltd v Compania Sud Americana de Vapores</i> [2003] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 405 and <i>Ace v Zurich Insurance</i> [2001] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 618, argued that many of the factors considered by the judge relating to matters of convenience should not carry much weight as they are not exceptional; indeed they were all foreseeable.\u00a0 Here, counsel for Golden Shore relied upon the words of Rix LJ in <i>Ace</i> (at 630):-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cIf a party agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of a state, it does not easily lie in its mouth to complain that it is inconvenient to conduct its litigation there \u2026\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Golden Shore also submitted that there was no basis for the judge to hold that it has no genuine desire for a trial in India.\u00a0 It has raised several defences to UCO\u2019s claim among which is the defence that UCO consented or acquiesced to the switching of the original bills.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Our analysis</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As far as the first and second factors mentioned in \u00b635 above are concerned, namely, that the parties are more connected with Singapore and the governing law of the B/L was Singapore law, while these two factors would favour a trial in Singapore, we recognise that they are not exceptional matters.\u00a0 Accordingly, the weight to be given to these two factors would have to be limited as they were known to the parties at the time of the contract and notwithstanding such knowledge, they had nevertheless provided in the B/L that the contractual forum should be India.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the third factor, it is on balance true that the evidence relating to the main defence of consent is to be found more in Singapore.\u00a0 We note that physically two witnesses will be in India.\u00a0 One is Mr S Srinivasan, UCO\u2019s then Manager for Credit Sanction, who is now there.\u00a0 But UCO have undertaken to bring him to Singapore for the trial.\u00a0 So Mr Srinivasan must effectively be treated as being in Singapore.\u00a0 The other is the Managing Director of SOM, Sood, who is now residing in India.\u00a0\u00a0 He dealt with UCO.\u00a0 Golden Shore submitted that if the trial were to be held in Singapore, they would not be able to compel Sood to attend the trial here.\u00a0 But his evidence may still be obtainable in India pursuant to Order 39 of the Rules of Court.\u00a0 Of course, the Judge did not think much of the importance of Sood, as Golden Shore is not even able to indicate what evidence Sood will be able to give.\u00a0 It is not known whether Sood will be saying that UCO knew and consented to the switch.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the other witnesses of UCO, they will be in Singapore.\u00a0 So will the bank documents relating to the transaction.\u00a0 While evidence as to the market price of the cargo will be in India, there should not be any great difficulty in obtaining such evidence.\u00a0 Thus, the factor relating to witnesses and other evidence would favour a trial in Singapore.\u00a0 But for the same reasons as for the first two factors, the weight to be given to this factor would not be as great as if this were a <i>forum non conveniens</i> case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning to the fourth factor, whether Golden Shore genuinely desire a trial in India, there are a few matters we need to consider.\u00a0 Golden Shore have raised a number of defences but the only one which merits any consideration at all is that of consent/acquiescence.\u00a0 On this, Golden Shore relied on two circumstances.\u00a0 First is the delay by UCO in seeking delivery of the goods and its total absence of inquiry with regard thereto.\u00a0 Second, is the fact that UCO negotiated the switched bills.\u00a0 As the details relating to the cargo on the original bills and the switched bills are identical, Golden Shore contended that UCO would thus have known of the switch or, in the alternative, it confirms that UCO had consented to the same.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Like the Judge, we are unable to see why it would be reasonable to infer consent or knowledge on UCO\u2019s part just because there was some delay in UCO making a claim or inquiries relating to the cargo.\u00a0 In fact UCO was told that there was delay because of an earthquake at the port of destination.\u00a0 Moreover, UCO was negotiating with SOM.\u00a0 As mentioned before, there is no indication as to what Sood would say on the matter.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing on which it can reasonably be inferred that UCO consented to the switch.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither has it been alleged that Golden Shore had checked with UCO before issuing the switched bills, bearing in mind that the original bills were stated \u201cto the order of UCO\u201d and UCO was also\u00a0 the notify party on the original bills.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the negotiation by UCO of the switched bills, here again there was nothing to indicate to UCO that the switched bills related to the same cargo as the original bills.\u00a0 The \u201cshipper\u201d stated on the switched bills was different from that on the original bills even though the cargo described was the same in the generic sense.\u00a0 No reasonable banker would think that the switched bills related to the \u201csame\u201d cargo as it would have been unimaginable that a carrier would issue another B/L for the same cargo without withdrawing the earlier B/L.\u00a0 Thus, the entire defence of consent/acquiescence is highly speculative.\u00a0 Even if it could be shown that the bank officers were careless in scrutinizing the switched bills, that could in no way suggest consent, which requires actual knowledge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is on these four factors that the Judge ruled that a strong cause has been established that the case should be allowed to proceed in Singapore. In refusing to order a stay, the Judge was exercising a discretion and in order for this court to upset that determination it must be shown that the Judge had erred on principles or had reached a conclusion which is plainly wrong.\u00a0 On all the four factors above, they, in varying degrees, favour the continuation of the case in Singapore.\u00a0 There is, therefore, no basis for us to hold that the Judge was wrong in coming to the conclusion that strong cause\u00a0 has\u00a0 been\u00a0 shown and a stay should be refused.\u00a0 In refusing a stay the Judge was exercising a discretion, and there is no way in which we can say that he was plainly wrong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Time-bar</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Considerable arguments were advanced by the parties, particularly by Golden Shore, on the facts that the defence of time-bar has accrued in India.\u00a0 If on other grounds a plaintiff, having reviewed the situation, thinks that he is entitled to bring an action in a forum other than the contractual forum and does not institute a protective action in the contractual forum, giving rise to a time-bar defence from arising, this factor should not be taken against the plaintiff.\u00a0 Here, we would quote the words of Colman J in <i>Citi-March</i> (at 75) for the rationale:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201c \u2026 if, notwithstanding the foreign jurisdiction clause, there are factors \u2026 in the interests of justice and all the parties, provide strong cause for treating the English Courts as the appropriate forum, the plaintiff\u2019s omission to protect time in the contractual forum will not condemn him to a stay of the English action.\u00a0 In such a case his self-induced prejudice, or putting it obversely, the defendants\u2019 accrued defence, is merely a consequence of the plaintiff having given effect by his own conduct to the principles which underly the exercise by the Court of its own discretion.\u00a0 For the Court to take into account against a plaintiff a time bar arising in such circumstances would involve an inconsistency of approach which cannot be justified in principle.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Amerco,</i> where the situation is similar to the present and where the action was time-barred in Indonesia, the accrual of this defence in favour of the defendant was not taken into account in refusing a stay.\u00a0 Indeed, in that case, where there was an indication that under Indonesian law it was not open to the defendant to waive the time-bar, the court said that it would either attach no weight to this factor or, adopting the views of Brandon J in <i>The Adolf Warski</i>, refuse a stay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverting to the present case, there is also an indication that under Indian law, the limitation cannot be waived, even though Mr Toh for Golden Shore said that his clients would be willing to waive the point.\u00a0 The Indian law allows the court a discretion to extend the limitation period by three months and nothing more and this extended three month period\u00a0 had long expired.\u00a0 Applying the approach of this Court in <i>Amerco</i> to the fact-situation here, the application for a stay would also have to be refused.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now we would like to turn to the argument of Golden Shore that as the Judge had found that UCO had acted unreasonably in failing to institute a protective writ in India, the factor of time-bar should work in their favour.\u00a0 It should not be treated to be a neutral point as the Judge did.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is no doubt true that UCO could have instituted a protective writ in India to prevent limitation from setting in. \u00a0 But even if UCO had done so, it would not have helped to determine whether in all the circumstances, a strong cause had been established that the case should be allowed to continue in Singapore.\u00a0 As we have held that by the other factors UCO had shown a strong cause, their failure to institute a protective writ in India is inconsequential.\u00a0 It is in this sense that the court in <i>The Jian He</i> had held that the failure of the plaintiffs to institute an action in China to be a neutral point.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>The Jian He</i>, where time-bar had also set in in the contractual forum, the court having reviewed the cases of <i>Citi-March v\u00a0 Neptune</i> (supra), <i>The MC Pearl</i> [1997] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 566 and <i>The K H Enterprise</i> [1994] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 593, made the following general proposition (at 21):-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cthe mere fact that the action would be time-barred in China is not of itself a sufficient ground for the court to exercise its discretion in favour of a plaintiff.\u00a0 It is really a neutral point, as refusing a stay would deprive the defendants of their accrued rights and granting a stay would defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 claim altogether.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court then went on to consider how a plaintiff could turn the factor in his favour (at 21):-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThe plaintiffs must justify their conduct in allowing limitation to arise in the contractual forum.\u00a0 They must show that they did not act unreasonably in failing to commence proceedings within time in the contractual forum, such as, by issuing a protective writ: see also <i>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd</i> <nobr>[1987] AC 460</nobr> and <i>The El Amria</i> [1981] 2 Lloyds Rep 119.\u00a0 They must explain fully and fairly to the court why they allowed time to lapse in the contractual forum: <i>The Bergen</i> [1997] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 710.\u00a0 Therefore, the factor of time-bar in the contractual forum is a two-edged sword, depending very much on the reasons given\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court next considered whether the plaintiffs in <i>The Jian He</i> had shown that they had acted reasonably in not taking out a protective writ in the contractual forum.\u00a0 It came to the view that the plaintiffs had not shown that and therefore the time-bar factor remained a neutral factor, i.e., it could not assist the plaintiffs to show strong cause.\u00a0 Here we would like to make a clarification on the reference in <i>The Jian He</i> to the factor of time-bar in the contractual forum being a two-edged sword.\u00a0 That perhaps is not an entirely happy description.\u00a0 In a case where the plaintiff could satisfactorily explain why he did not institute a protective writ in the contractual forum, this factor would assist the plaintiff in establishing strong cause.\u00a0 But if he could not, this factor would not assist him.\u00a0 However, this did not mean that the plaintiff could not rely on other factors to show strong cause.\u00a0 As for the defendant, where the plaintiff could not explain the failure to institute a protective writ within time in the contractual forum, the \u201cbenefit\u201d to the defendant would be that the plaintiff could not rely on it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the end of the day, it is the overall justice of the case that is going to be decisive.\u00a0 In the words of Colman J in <i>Citi-March</i> (at 77):-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cAt the end of the day the Court must consider whether in the interests of justice it is more appropriate to permit a plaintiff to proceed in England, although he has omitted to preserve time in the contractual forum, and although England is not clearly the more appropriate forum\u00a0 than to deprive him of all opportunity of pursuing his claim in any forum.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a sense this observation of Colman J went further than the facts of the present case necessitate because here, as we have determined earlier, Singapore is the more appropriate forum for the case.\u00a0 We shall leave this aspect of the matter to another case on another day.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Judgment</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, we would agree with the Judge that strong cause had been shown that both the actions (in respect of which Civil Appeal 53/2002 and Civil Appeal 55/2003 arose) should continue in Singapore.\u00a0 Accordingly, the two appeals are dismissed with costs.\u00a0 The security for costs in relation to both appeals, together with any accrued interest, shall be released to the respondents, to account of costs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There shall only be one set of costs for the respondents, except with regard to

(\u201cElectec\u201d) and M-Systems Flash Disk Pioneers Ltd (\u201cM-Systems\u201d) and the appellant in Civil Appeal No\u00a069 of 2005, Ritronics Components (S\u2019pore) Pte Ltd (\u201cRitronics\u201d), appealed against Lai Kew Chai\u00a0J\u2019s decision (reported at <nobr>[2005] 3 SLR 389</nobr>) that they had infringed Singapore patent No\u00a087504 (WO 01/61692), which was granted to the respondent, Trek Technology (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cTrek\u201d), and were therefore liable in damages for the infringement. We dismissed the appeal and now give the reasons for our decision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 21\u00a0February 2000, Trek filed an application for a Singapore patent (the \u201cpatent\u201d) with respect to a portable data storage device. Trek claimed that the patent protected its product, \u201cThumbDrive\u201d, which was unveiled at an international exhibition in Germany a week after the application for the patent was submitted in Singapore. The ThumbDrive device took the computer world by storm. Only about the size of a human thumb, it can be plugged directly into any universal serial bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) of a personal computer. With no moving parts, it functions as a disk drive and has a capacity exceeding that of other mass storage devices.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The patent was granted on 16\u00a0April 2002. Since then, patents have been granted in, <i>inter alia</i>, the UK, New Zealand and South Africa.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before long, other companies started to produce devices that were similar to the ThumbDrive device. An Israeli company, M-Systems, sold such devices under the names \u201cDiskOnKey\u201d and \u201cDiskey\u201d. Electec is the exclusive Singapore importer of Diskey while Global is the exclusive Singapore distributor of the said product.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another company, Ritronics, also started to manufacture and sell storage devices similar to the ThumbDrive device. Its devices are known as \u201cSlimDisk\u201d and \u201cBioSlimDisk\u201d. These devices were launched or made available in Singapore before July 2002.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trek filed two actions to protect its patent. In Suit No\u00a0609 of 2002, it sued M-Systems, Global and Electec with respect to the devices known as \u201cDiskOnKey\u201d and \u201cDiskey\u201d. For convenience, M-Systems, Global and Electec will be referred to as \u201cM-Systems\u201d in the rest of this judgment. In response, M-Systems filed a counterclaim for the revocation of the patent on the ground that it is invalid. In the second action, Suit No\u00a0672 of 2002, Trek sued Ritronics with respect to the latter\u2019s devices, namely \u201cSlimDisk\u201d and \u201cBioSlimDisk\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its actions against M-Systems and Ritronics, Trek sought damages for infringement of its patent as well as injunctions to stop the appellants from making, selling or disposing of any product that infringed its patent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trek was not the only company that sued to protect its turf in the battle for sales of these thumb-sized data storage devices. M-Systems instituted Suit No\u00a0604 of 2002 against Trek for threatened patent infringement. By an Order of Court dated 14\u00a0October 2002, Trek\u2019s two actions against M-Systems and Ritronics and M-System\u2019s suit against Trek were consolidated.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The trial judge\u2019s decision</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before the hearing of the consolidated actions, Trek applied to amend its patent to clarify the definition of its invention, a procedure allowed by s\u00a083 of the Patents Act (Cap\u00a0221, 2002\u00a0Rev Ed). The application was granted by Lai\u00a0J.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In his judgment on 12\u00a0May 2005, Lai\u00a0J held that Trek\u2019s patent was valid in both its amended and unamended forms and that M-Systems and Ritronics, whose devices infringed Claims\u00a01, 5 and 7 of the patent, were liable in damages for the said infringement of Trek\u2019s patent. In view of his findings, M-Systems and Ritronics failed in their claim with respect to groundless threat of infringement.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issues in both appeals which will be considered in this judgment are whether the ThumbDrive device is within the ambit of the patent, whether the amendments proposed by Trek to the patent were properly allowed during the trial and whether Trek\u2019s patent is invalid for lack of novelty and inventiveness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Whether the ThumbDrive device is within the ambit of the patent</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants asserted that the ThumbDrive device was not protected by the patent. Ritronics alleged that \u201cthe fundamental error of the Judge was that he did not look at the patent document only but read into the patent features in the [ThumbDrive device]\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be borne in mind that when Trek applied for the patent on 21\u00a0February 2000, it had already invented the ThumbDrive device, which was unveiled at an international exhibition one week later. Trek\u2019s counsel, Mr\u00a0Davinder Singh\u00a0SC, thus pointed out that it is most unlikely that, having invented the ThumbDrive device, Trek would fail to describe its essential features in a patent application that was intended to protect its rights in relation to this device.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The language of a patent is deemed to have been addressed by the inventor not to a panel of equity draftsmen but to the man skilled in the art (<i>per</i> Dillon\u00a0LJ in <i>Strix Limited v Otter Controls Limited</i> <nobr>[1991] FSR 354</nobr> at 357). Indeed, in <i>Catnic Components Limited v Hill &amp; Smith Limited</i> <nobr>[1982] RPC 183</nobr> at 243, Lord\u00a0Diplock aptly observed that the words of a patent \u201cshould be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge\u201d. We agree that the purposive approach is preferred as it balances the rights of the patentee and those of third parties. More recently, in <i>Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] RPC 9</nobr> at [48], the House of Lords endorsed the <i>Catnic</i> purposive approach as consonant with the Protocol on the Interpretation of Art\u00a069 of the European Patent Convention, which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a patent should be interpreted \u201cas defining a position \u2026 which combines a fair protection for the patentee with a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The original claims by Trek under its patent, which are to be purposively interpreted, are as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Claim\u00a01</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A portable data storage device comprising a coupling device for coupling to a computer serial bus, an interface device coupled to the coupling device, a memory control device and a non-volatile solid-state memory device; the memory control device being coupled between the interface device and the memory device to control the flow of data from the memory device to the coupling device.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Claim\u00a02</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A device according to claim\u00a01, wherein the non-volatile solid-state memory device is a read/write memory device.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Claim\u00a03</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A device according to claim\u00a02, wherein the read/write memory device is a flash memory device.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Claim\u00a04</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A device according to claim\u00a02 or claim 3, wherein the memory control device controls the flow of data to and from the memory device.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Claim\u00a05</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A device according to any of claims\u00a02 to 4, further comprising a manually operated switch movable between a first position in which writing of data to the memory device is enabled, and a second position in which writing of data to the memory device is prevented.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Claim\u00a06</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the memory control device comprises a micro-controller.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Claim\u00a07</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the coupling device comprises a universal serial bus coupling device and the interface device comprises a USB driver.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><u>Claim\u00a08</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the coupling device comprises an IEEE 1394 (Firewire) protocol coupling device and the interface device is a Firewire protocol driver.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is evident that the features of the ThumbDrive device are adequately covered in the claims. For a start, the patent teaches the concept of a portable data storage device which functions as an alternative to a conventional magnetic disc or a CD-ROM but is more convenient because it is more compact than the alternative mediums of storage of data. The patent outlines the disadvantages of the conventional prior art as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Conventional data storage devices generally fall into two categories. The first is electronic, solid-state memory devices such as read only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM). These memory devices are generally fitted within the computer. <i>They are not intended to be removable or portable so that they may be used on different computers, for example, to permit the transfer of data from one computer to another computer.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The second type of device is surface based data storage devices in which data is stored, typically, on the surface of a disk or tape. Examples of surface storage devices are magnetic disks and CD ROMs. Such data storage devices require a mechanical drive mechanism to be installed in or coupled to the computer to permit the data on the storage device to be read by the computer. In addition, such memory devices are limited by the surface area of the storage device, and the <i>combination of the storage device and the drive mechanism for reading data from the storage device is generally bulky and/or delicate due to the moving parts that are required within the drive mechanism and/or storage device.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The patent next describes the inside of the device (referred to as \u201cdevice\u00a010\u201d) as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">An advantage of the device 10 \u2026 is that it provides a portable data storage device for a computer which does not require a mechanical operated reading/writing device. In addition, the device 10 has no moving parts. <i>This enables [the] data storage device 10 to be more compact than conventional portable data storage devices.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus far, the patent has described what the ThumbDrive device is capable of doing. Realising that the ThumbDrive device scores highly because it may be directly plugged to and unplugged from a USB socket in the computer, the appellants tried to distance the patent from this device by claiming that the patent does not disclose such direct plugging and unplugging. They suggested that a skilled reader of the patent would assume that a cable would be required to connect the patented device to the computer. In view of this, whether the patent discloses a device that requires a captive or detached cable became an important issue.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants\u2019 expert witness, Mr\u00a0Shimon Shmueli, acknowledged that the patent disclosed a storage device with a USB coupling device and driver but he asserted that the coupling device in the patent was not in the form of an integrated USB \u201cA\u201d plug without an intervening cable. His rationale for this was that USB specifications refer to only two types of connections, namely a captive or a detachable cable and, as such, the patent must be taken to have disclosed either a captive or detachable cable. This is incorrect because by the time Trek applied for its patent, there was a device in the market known as \u201cAladdin\u201d, a security key for the protection of confidential data stored in a computer, which is connected to a USB socket without a captive or detachable cable.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trek\u2019s expert witness, Mr\u00a0John Hyde, testified that a skilled person will understand that Trek\u2019s patent discloses a portable memory device having an integrated USB plug for direct connection to the USB socket on a computer without an intervening cable. He added that as the patent also highlights the portability, compactness and durability of the device, the attributes of the ThumbDrive device have been clearly disclosed in the patent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is rather telling that the appellants\u2019 expert witness, Mr Shmueli, conceded during cross-examination as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Q.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Show us where in the specifications or claim ... any reference to a cable between D12 and the connector, let alone a captive cable.

This is not to say that an expert\u2019s view on what a skilled reader would think is totally irrelevant. In our view, the trial judge bore this in mind and rightly accepted that the patent discloses a unitary data storage device with an integrated USB plug to enable direct connection to the USB points of computers without the need for a captive or detachable cable. That being the case, the appellants\u2019 argument that the ThumbDrive is not a device protected by the patent is clearly unacceptable.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Whether the application to amend the patent should have been allowed</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants\u2019 assertion that Trek should not have been allowed to amend its patent during the trial will next be considered.

In the days before claims it was understandable. The patent was either valid or invalid, and to identify the need to disclaim part of the invention was to admit invalidity. To sue on a patent known to be invalid was seen to be wrong and unfair. When an application to disclaim was made, the patentee was put on terms that it would not start further infringement proceedings until the application to disclaim had been disposed of. With the advent of claims, and later provision for relief for infringement of a patent only partially valid, albeit on terms which would normally include amendment \u2026 and on condition that the specification had been framed in good faith and with reasonable skill and knowledge, the rationale for this approach becomes less clear.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We agree that the modern context in which patents are registered must be taken into account when considering whether amendments should be allowed. The present practice in Singapore is that skilled examiners examine and scrutinise patent applications and if there is a negative patent examination report, it is in the patent file at the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and is open for public inspection. Lai\u00a0J was thus entitled to say at [67] of his judgment that as examination reports are available for public inspection, adverse parties are able to evaluate the validity and strength of patents which have been filed and they are \u201cless likely to be surprised (and consequently prejudiced) by subsequent amendments which may be sought by the patentee, even if this takes place in the course of patent litigation\u201d. As there is little scope for abuse when patent applications for patents are filed nowadays, we agree that a more lenient approach towards amendments is now called for.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We noted that the appellants complained that the amendments were not clear. More specifically, they thought the phrase \u201cmore compact than a conventional magnetic disk or CD-ROM storage device\u201d was not concise enough. In the context in which these words appear, there is no doubt as to what they mean. After all, as the trial judge pointed out, the appellants\u2019 expert, Mr\u00a0Shmueli, had no difficulty using the words \u201ccompact\u201d and \u201cconventional\u201d in relation to the appellants\u2019 devices. The appellants\u2019 other complaint was that Claim\u00a01A was ambiguous but the evidence suggests that Claim\u00a01A is dependent on Claim\u00a01 and is thus supported by the patent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the argument that there was undue delay in applying for an amendment of a patent, this was not substantiated. Lai\u00a0J pointed out that the appellants had continued to introduce more and more prior art into the litigation and by doing so, they had shifted the targets constantly. There had been no bad faith or reprehensible conduct on Trek\u2019s part. As such, the question of barring the amendments on the ground of Trek\u2019s delay did not arise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there were sufficient references in the existing specification to support the amendments.

We saw no reason to interfere with his decision on the issue of infringement and will proceed to consider the appellants\u2019 defences.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appellants\u2019 defences</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a013(1) of the Patents Act provides that a patentable invention is one that is new, involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial application. As has been mentioned, the appellants asserted that Trek\u2019s patent is invalid because it is not new or novel and not inventive.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Novelty</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a014 of the Patents Act provides that an invention shall be taken to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art. The state of the art comprises all matter (whether a product, a process, information about either or anything else) which has, at any time before the priority date of that invention, been made available to the public, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, by written or oral description, by use or in any way. Needless to say, disparate pieces of prior art cannot be combined unless a document directs the reader to do so. In considering what a person of competent but average technical skill and who lacks imagination would make out of the prior art, the oft-cited words of Sachs\u00a0LJ in <i>The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company v The Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company Limited</i> <nobr>[1972] RPC 457</nobr> at 486 are worth reiterating:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">To anticipate the patentee\u2019s claim the prior publication must contain clear and unmistakeable directions to do what the patentee claims to have invented \u2026 A signpost, however clear, upon the road to the patentee\u2019s invention will not suffice.

These devices were introduced into the market at a time when USB ports sat together with other expansion ports at the back of a desktop computer. The use of a cable made the said devices more user-friendly.

Furthermore, the device is truly portable as it is about the size of a human thumb and it has a \u201cnon-volatile solid-state memory\u201d, which means that data which is stored in a semiconductor chip is not lost when power is switched off. This facilitates the transfer of data from one computer to another.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, Trek had an inventive concept for a new type of data storage device that was quite different from and more convenient to use than conventional data storage devices. Admittedly, all the elements required for this invention were available to those skilled in the art. Solid-state non-volatile memory was well known and USB plugs were standard. Yet before Trek applied for the patent in question, no one else thought of combining all these elements together. Instead, others continued to produce variations of the magnetic disk or CD-ROM as well as devices that required the use of a connecting cable because they were not intended for direct plugging into the USB socket of a computer. It was thus not obvious to proceed from a two-piece cable-connected prior art to the neat cableless solution presented by the ThumbDrive device. In this context, the following words of Tomlin\u00a0J in <i>Samuel Parkes &amp; Co Ld v Cocker Brothers Ld</i> (1929) 46\u00a0RPC 241 at 248 are worth noting:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[W]hen once it had been found \u2026 that the problem had waited solution for many years, and that the device is in fact novel and superior to what had gone before, and has been widely used, and used in preference to alternative devices, it is \u2026 practically impossible to say that there is not present that scintilla of invention necessary to support the Patent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having looked at the device, some may view the invention as a simple one but simplicity has never been a bar to inventiveness and it has been reiterated often enough that <i>ex post facto</i> analysis can often be unfair to inventors (see, for instance, the decision of this court in <i>Peng Lian Trading Co v Contour Optik Inc</i> <nobr>[2003] 2 SLR 560</nobr> at [28]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is trite that the commercial success of a new product may be taken into account when considering its inventiveness.

The relevant facts giving rise to the appeal now before us are as follows. The appellant, Mr\n\nHarris Hakim ('Mr Hakim') entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 14 May 1996 ('the\n\nAgreement') with the respondents, Allgreen Properties Ltd ('Allgreen'), whereby Mr Hakim agreed to\n\npurchase from Allgreen an apartment in a private housing development called 'Springdale Condominium'\n\nwhich was then being developed by Allgreen. The Agreement was in the form prescribed as Form E by\n\nthe Housing Developers Rules (1990 ed) and incorporated within it the Singapore Law Society's\n\nConditions of Sale 1994, in so far as those conditions were applicable to the sale and were not\n\nvaried by or were not inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement.</p>\n\n<p>2. The purchase price for the apartment was $1,165,000, which was to be paid by instalments at\n\ndifferent stages of the construction as provided in cl 3 of the Agreement. It was provided by cl\n\n5(1) of the Agreement that, in the event that Mr Hakim defaulted in payment of any instalment for\n\nmore than 14 days, Allgreen would be entitled to charge interest at the specified rate as provided\n\nin cl 5(2). By cl 5(3), the Agreement further provided that if Mr Hakim should default in payment of\n\nany instalment for more than 14 days, Allgreen would be entitled, at their option on giving not less\n\nthan 21 days' notice to Mr Hakim, to treat the Agreement as having been repudiated and, unless in\n\nthe meanwhile the unpaid instalments and interest were paid up, upon the expiration of the 21 days,\n\nthe Agreement would be annulled, and in such event, without prejudice to any other rights available\n\nto Allgreen at law or in equity, Allgreen would be entitled to certain rights as provided in\n\nparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of cl 5(3). We shall refer to the terms of this clause in detail in a\n\nmoment.</p>\n\n<p>3. About two years later, Mr Hakim ran into financial difficulties, and found it difficult to\n\nkeep up with the instalment payments. By that time, the total amount of instalments Mr Hakim had\n\npaid to Allgreen under the Agreement amounted to $669,000. By a letter dated 28 July 1998, written\n\nby his solicitors to Allgreen, he requested the latter to serve him a notice under clause 5 of the\n\nAgreement and thereafter to exercise their rights under cl 5(3): forfeit the sum of $233,000, which\n\nis 20% of the purchase price of $1,165,000, deduct it from the sum of $699,000, being the total of\n\nthe instalments previously paid, and refund the balance thereof to him. Allgreen, however, refused\n\nto accede to this request.</p>\n\n<p>4. Mr Hakim continued to default in the payment of further instalments. Finally, on 19 August\n\n1999, Allgreen decided to invoke cl 5(3) of the Agreement. Allgreen's solicitors sent a notice to Mr\n\nHakim pursuant to cl 5(3) which, so far as relevant, read as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>We refer to the above matter and note that the progress payments under clauses 3(1)(h) and\n\n  3(3)(a) of the Sale and Purchase Agreement were due on 5 November 1998 and 30 April 1999\n\n  respectively.</p>\n\n  <p/>\n\n  <p>In view of the above, we are instructed by our clients to and do hereby give to your client(s)\n\n  notice pursuant to clause 5(3) of the Sale and Purchase Agreement that unless your client(s) pay\n\n  the unpaid instalment(s) and interest <u>within twenty-one (21) days from the date hereof</u>, the\n\n  said Sale and Purchase Agreement shall at the expiration of the said twenty-one (21) days be\n\n  annulled and our clients shall, without prejudice to any other rights available to them at law or\n\n  in equity proceed in accordance with clause 5(3) of the said Sale and Purchase Agreement.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>5. As might have been expected, Mr Hakim was unable to comply with the notice. On 6 December\n\n1999, Allgreen's solicitors sent Mr Hakim a further letter referring to the previous notice and\n\nstating, among other things, the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with Condition 29 of the Singapore Law Society's\n\n  Conditions of Sale 1994, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to our\n\n  clients at law or equity, the deposit paid by your client has been forfeited and retained for our\n\n  client's own benefit.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is common ground that the reference in the letter to 'Condition 29 of the Singapore Law\n\nSociety's Conditions of Sale 1994' was an error and that the correct reference intended was 'clause\n\n5(3)(c) of the Agreement'. Nothing however turns on this error.</p>\n\n<p>6. Mr Hakim's apartment was subsequently resold by Allgreen. By a letter dated 23 March 2000,\n\nAllgreen's solicitors informed Mr Hakim that out of the total amount of the instalments paid up by\n\nhim, Allgreen would be refunding him the sum of $399,259.87, and provided the following computation\n\nshowing how the sum of $399,259.87 was arrived at:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <table border=\"0\" width=\"80%\">\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\">1.</td>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Original Sale Price</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$1,165,000.00</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"/>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\">2.</td>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">New Sale Price</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$ 900,000.00</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"/>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\">3.</td>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Shortfall</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$ 265,000.00</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"/>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\"><u>Add</u></td>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Outstanding Interest</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$ 20,896.30</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"/>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\"/>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Legal Fees</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$ 350.20</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"/>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\"/>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Outstanding Maintenance Charges</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$ 2,532.54</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"/>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\"/>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Agent's Commission</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$ 9,000.00</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"/>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\"/>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Outstanding Property Tax</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$ 1,652.09</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"/>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\"/>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Auction/Valuation Charges</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\">$ 309.00\u00a0</td>\n\n      <td width=\"130\">$299,740.13</td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\">4.</td>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Off-set amount paid by original purchaser to date (60%)</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\"/>\n\n      <td width=\"130\"><u>$699,000.00</u></td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td width=\"52\"/>\n\n      <td width=\"339\">Refund Amount</td>\n\n      <td width=\"134\"/>\n\n      <td width=\"130\">$399,259.87</td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n  </table>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>7. Mr Hakim disputed this computation. While he accepted that Allgreen were entitled to claim for\n\nthe outstanding interest, maintenance charges and property tax, these being accrued debts due to\n\nAllgreen, and to claim the sum of $223,000 being the 20% of the purchase price that was forfeited\n\nunder cl 5(3) of the Agreement, he disputed that Allgreen were entitled to claim for legal fees, the\n\nagent's commission incurred during the sale, the auction/valuation charges, as well as the shortfall\n\narising from the resale. His computation of the refundable amount was as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <table border=\"0\" width=\"61%\">\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td>Total payment by Mr Hakim</td>\n\n      <td>$699,000.00</td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td>Less 20% pursuant to clause 5(3)(c)</td>\n\n      <td>$233,000.00</td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td>Outstanding interest</td>\n\n      <td>$20,896.30</td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td>Outstanding maintenance charges</td>\n\n      <td>$2,532.54</td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td>Outstanding property tax</td>\n\n      <td>$1,652.09</td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n    <tr>\n\n      <td>Amount to be refunded:</td>\n\n      <td><u>$440,919.07</u></td>\n\n    </tr>\n\n  </table>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>8. Allgreen were unwilling to refund $440,919.07 as requested by Mr Hakim. They refunded only\n\n$399,259.87, which was accepted Mr Hakim without prejudice to his right to claim the balance. Mr\n\nHakim therefore commenced proceedings in Originating Summons No 896 of 2000 ('the present action'),\n\nseeking a determination by the Court as to the amount to be refunded by Allgreen to him, and claimed\n\nthe balance sum of $41,659.20.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Decision below</strong></p>\n\n<p>9. At the hearing below, Mr Pereira, counsel for Mr Hakim submitted that by virtue of the words:\n\n'without prejudice to any other rights available to [Allgreen] at law or in equity', upon the\n\ntermination of the contract under cl 5(3), Allgreen were entitled to elect either of the two\n\ncourses:</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i) to re-sell the property and pursue a\n\nclaim against Mr Hakim for unliquidated damages at common law, or</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>(ii) to proceed under cl 5(3) by, <i>inter alia</i>, forfeiting 20% of the purchase price.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In support of this construction of cl 5(3), counsel relied on three cases decided in England: <i>Tally\n\nand Anor v Wolsey-Neech </i>(1979) 38 P&amp;CR 164; <i>Wallace-Turner v Cole</i> (1983) 46 P&amp;CR\n\n164 and <i>Sakkas and Anor v Donford Ltd</i> (1983) 46 P&amp;CR 290. We shall turn to these cases\n\nshortly. Reverting to the instant case, Mr Pereira submitted that, as Allgreen had elected to\n\nexercise their rights under cl 5(3), they would be entitled only to such compensation as cl 5(3)(b)\n\nand (c) allowed, and were not entitled to recover, in addition, any damages at common law. Any loss\n\narising from the re-sale above and beyond the forfeited sum and the interest under cl 5(3)(b) and\n\n(c) was irrecoverable.</p>\n\n<p>10. On the other hand, Mr Peter, counsel for Allgreen submitted that the right to invoke cl 5(3)\n\nand forfeit 20% of the purchase price was exercisable, in the words of cl 5(3), 'without prejudice\n\nto any other rights available to [Allgreen] at law or in equity'. It was thus submitted that in the\n\ninstant case the 20% forfeited was insufficient to cover Allgreen's losses arising from the resale,\n\nand therefore on the basis of those words in cl 5(3) they were entitled to recover from Mr Hakim the\n\namount of loss they had sustained over and above the 20%.</p>\n\n<p>11. Allgreen's contention was accepted by the judge. He held at \u00a09 as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>9  On the face of it, cl 5(3) gave Allgreen Properties the right to forfeit the 20% as well\n\n  as pursue other rights they may have against HH [Mr Hakim] for the breach of contract. And, in the\n\n  absence of any restrictive words in cl 5(3), these other rights must include Allgreen Properties'\n\n  right to damages (by way of expenses in the re-sale and any drop in the sale price) should those\n\n  damages exceed the 20% forfeited by Allgreen Properties under cl 5(3).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The judge rejected the three cases relied upon by Mr Pereira on the ground that 'the context and\n\ncontent of the conditions' in those cases were materially different from the provisions of cl 5(3),\n\nand the courts in those cases held that those conditions provided for liquidated damages, and that\n\nthe parties, having pre-agreed on the quantum of damages, were precluded from claiming additional\n\namounts as damages. Turning to cl 5(3) the judge said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>11 Clause 5(3) in our present Agreement does not appear to be a clause setting out the\n\n  liquidated damages payable on breach. Whilst cl 5(3) entitled Allgreen Properties to forfeit 20%\n\n  of the purchase price, it does not say, nor can it readily be inferred from the context, that this\n\n  20% is to be treated as liquidated damages. Indeed, cl 5(3) leaves the question of damages for\n\n  breach open because the right to forfeit the 20% is prefaced by the words \"without prejudice\n\n  to any other rights available to him at law or in equity\". These words appear to have the\n\n  effect of preserving the right of Allgreen Properties to recover damages or seek other remedies at\n\n  common law or in equity should Allgreen Properties suffer damages in excess of the 20%. The effect\n\n  of the words \"without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in\n\n  equity\" in cl 5(3) appears to me to be that should the damages suffered by Allgreen\n\n  Properties be less than 20%, Allgreen Properties are entitled to all of that 20% but should the\n\n  damages exceed 20%, Allgreen Properties are entitled to the additional damages.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>12. In the result, the judge found that Allgreen were entitled to make the deductions as they did\n\nand he dismissed Mr Hakim's claim. Mr Hakim now appeals against this decision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The appeal</strong></p>\n\n<p>13. The issue before us is one of construction of cl 5(3) of the Agreement and in particular the\n\nwords 'without prejudice to the other rights available to [the vendor] at law or in equity'. It is\n\nconvenient at this stage to set out in full cl 5(3) and also cl 5(4) of the Agreement, which are as\n\nfollows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>(3) If any such unpaid instalments and interest remain unpaid for any period in excess of\n\n  fourteen (14) days after its due date, the Vendor shall be entitled at its option on giving to the\n\n  Purchaser or his solicitors not less than twenty-one (21) days' notice in writing to treat this\n\n  Agreement as having been repudiated by the Purchaser and (unless in the meanwhile the unpaid\n\n  instalments and interest shall have been paid) this Agreement shall at the expiration of such\n\n  notice (and in this respect time shall be of the essence) be annulled and in such an event,\n\n  without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in equity, the Vendor shall be\n\n  entitled:-</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>(a) to resell or otherwise dispose of the building unit as the Vendor shall see fit as if\n\n    this Agreement had not been entered into;</p>\n\n    <p>(b) to recover from the instalments (excluding payments for interest) previously paid by the\n\n    Purchaser all interest calculated in accordance with paragraph (1) of this clause owing and\n\n    unpaid; and</p>\n\n    <p>(c) to forfeit and retain for his own benefit a sum equal to twenty (20) per cent of the\n\n    purchase price from the instalments (excluding payment for interest) previously paid by the\n\n    Purchaser.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p>(4) The balance of the instalments prepaid by the Purchaser after making deductions in\n\n  accordance with paragraph (3)(b) and (c) shall be refunded to the Purchaser.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Historical perspective</strong></p>\n\n<p>14. The Agreement was in a statutory form, namely Form E prescribed by the Housing Developers\n\nRules (1990 ed) for the sale by a developer of a flat or any housing accommodation in a condominium\n\nproject. All the relevant forms of sale and purchase agreements for sale of housing units by\n\ndevelopers have been prescribed by law since the amendments made in 1967 to the Housing Developers\n\nRules 1965. Such forms have been amended from time to time by the legislature, and it would be\n\nhelpful for our purpose to examine the relevant amendments made to the statutory forms which led to\n\nthe evolution of the cl 5(3) now under consideration.</p>\n\n<p>15. The Housing Developers (Licensing and Control) Act (Cap 130, 1985 ed) was enacted in 1965 and\n\nbecame law on 1 October 1965. Under s 22 of the Act, the Minister is empowered to make rules for the\n\npurpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act and in particular for regulating, inter alia, (a)\n\nthe payments to be made by a purchaser to a housing developer before and during the construction of\n\nthe premises in question, (b) the form of contract to be made between a housing developer and a\n\npurchaser, and (c) the terms and conditions of such a contract. The first set of rules was the\n\nHousing Developers Rules 1965. At that time, the 1965 Rules did not prescribe any specific form of\n\nagreement between a housing developer and a purchaser, but Rule 9 contained specific provisions -\n\n(a) prescribing the sum of $500 as the maximum sum as the booking fee to be paid by a purchaser for\n\nan option or right to purchase the property; (b) prescribing a sum equal to 10% of the purchase\n\nprice as the maximum to be paid by the purchaser either as a deposit or the first instalment of the\n\npurchaser price; (c) requiring the developer to submit to the Controller of Housing for approval a\n\nproposal regarding the amounts of instalments payable by the purchaser at various stages of the\n\nconstruction of the building, and upon such approval, requiring the developer to adhere to the\n\nproposal; and (d) prescribing 90% of the purchase price as the maximum to be paid by the purchaser,\n\nuntil the issue and delivery of the certificate of fitness for occupation for the premises.</p>\n\n<p>16. The statutory forms of agreement between a developer and a purchaser were introduced for the\n\nfirst time by the Housing Developers (Amendments) Rules 1967. For the sale of flats the form\n\nprescribed was then Form B. The agreement in that form provided, inter alia, payment of the purchase\n\nprice by instalments according to the stages of the construction of the premises in question and\n\npayment of interest on any instalment which the purchaser failed to pay. The forerunner of the\n\npresent cl 5(3) under consideration was cl 5 of Form B, which so far as material was as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>5 . . . . . .If any of such unpaid instalments and interest shall remain unpaid for any period\n\n  in excess of forty days after its due date the Vendor shall be entitled at its option on giving to\n\n  the Purchaser or his solicitors not less than thirty days' notice in writing to treat this\n\n  Agreement as having been repudiated by the Purchaser and (unless in the meanwhile such unpaid\n\n  instalment and interest shall have been paid) this Agreement shall at the expiration of the said\n\n  notice (and in this respect time shall be of the essence) be annulled and in such an event -</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>(a) The Vendor shall be entitled to deal with or otherwise dispose of the said Flat in such\n\n    manner as the Vendor shall see fit as if this Agreement has not been entered into.</p>\n\n    <p>(b) The instalments previously paid by the Purchaser to the Vendor excluding any interest\n\n    paid shall be dealt with and disposed of as follows: -\u00a0</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n\n      <p>(i) firstly all interest calculated up to the date of the expiration of the said notice\n\n      owing and unpaid shall be paid to the Vendor;\u00a0</p>\n\n      <p>(ii) secondly a sum equivalent to 25 per cent of the balance thereof shall be paid and\n\n      forfeited to the Vendor; and\u00a0</p>\n\n      <p>(iii) lastly the residue thereof shall be refunded to the Purchaser.\u00a0</p>\n\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>(c) Neither party hereto shall have any further claims against the other for costs, damages,\n\n    compensation or otherwise hereunder.\u00a0</p>\n\n    <p>(d) Each party hereto shall pay its own costs in the matter.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, in the event that this clause was validly invoked, the developer's rights for any loss he\n\nsuffered were limited to recovering from the instalments previously paid (i) all the interest owing\n\nand unpaid up to a certain date, and (ii) thereafter a sum equal to 25% of the balance of the\n\ninstalments (previously paid). After the recovery of these sums, the developer was obliged to refund\n\nthe residue to the purchaser. The developer was not entitled to claim damages for any other loss\n\noccasioned by the breach of contract on the part of the purchaser.</p>\n\n<p>17. The 1965 Rules were repealed by the Housing Developers Rules 1976. The 1976 Rules introduced\n\nnew forms of sale and purchase agreements. Form B as prescribed there was the form of sale agreement\n\nfor the sale of a flat or any housing accommodation in a condominium project. Clause 1 of the new\n\nForm B incorporated for the first time the conditions of sale by public auction known as 'The\n\n(Revised) Singapore Conditions of Sale' so far as they were applicable to a sale by private treaty\n\nand were not varied by or inconsistent with the special conditions contained in Form B. In so far as\n\nrelevant for our purpose, cl 5(3) of the then Form B was substantially the same as the material\n\nparts of cl 5 of the previous Form B under the 1965 Rules (as amended in 1967), and was as\n\nfollows:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>(3) If any of such unpaid instalments and interest remains unpaid for any period in excess of\n\n  forty (40) days after its due date the Vendor shall be entitled at its option on giving to the\n\n  Purchaser or his Solicitors not less than thirty (30) days' notice in writing to treat this\n\n  Agreement as having been repudiated by the Purchaser and (unless in the meanwhile such unpaid\n\n  instalment and interest shall have been paid) this Agreement shall at the expiration of the said\n\n  notice (and in this respect time shall be of the essence) be annulled and in such an event -\u00a0</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>(a) the Vendor shall be entitled to deal with or otherwise dispose of the housing unit in\n\n    such manner as the Vendor shall see fit as if this Agreement had not been entered into;\u00a0</p>\n\n    <p>(b) the instalments previously paid by the Purchaser to the Vendor excluding any interest\n\n    paid shall be dealt with and disposed of as follows:-\u00a0</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n\n      <p>(i) firstly, all interests calculated in accordance with paragraph (1) hereof owing and\n\n      unpaid shall be paid to the Vendor;\u00a0</p>\n\n      <p>(ii) secondly, a sum equal to twenty-five (25) per cent of the balance thereof shall be\n\n      paid and forfeited to the Vendor; and\u00a0</p>\n\n      <p>(iii) lastly the residue thereof shall be refunded to the Purchaser;\u00a0</p>\n\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>(c) neither party hereto shall have any further claims against the other for costs, damages,\n\n    compensation or otherwise hereunder; and\u00a0</p>\n\n    <p>(d) each party hereto shall pay its own costs in the matter.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>18. The next significant amendments made to the statutory forms of agreement were introduced by\n\nthe Housing Developers (Amendment) Rules, 1981. For our purpose we need to mention only two material\n\namendments to the relevant form, namely, Form B. First, Rule 9 of the 1981 Rules deleted the\n\nreference to 'The (Revised) Singapore Conditions of Sale' in Clause 1 of the sale and purchase\n\nagreement and replaced it with the 'Singapore Law Society Conditions of Sale, 1981'. Secondly, Rule\n\n12 amended cl 5(3) of the sale and purchase agreement by deleting paragraphs (2) and (3) thereof and\n\nsubstituting new paragraphs (2), (3) and (4). Paragraph (2) prescribed the interest rate payable for\n\noverdue instalments; paragraph (3) was the cl 5(3) which is now under consideration, and paragraph\n\n(4) was cl 5(4) of the Agreement. For the first time, the words 'without prejudice to any other\n\nrights available to him at law or in equity' were inserted in cl 5(3). It was suggested by Mr\n\nPereira that these words were derived from condition 29 of the 'Singapore Law Society Conditions of\n\nSale, 1981' which were incorporated into the statutory form of agreement. His reason for saying this\n\nwas that condition 29, which deals with the situation where the purchaser fails to complete on the\n\ncompletion date, provides that if the purchaser does not comply with the notice to complete served\n\nby the vendor pursuant to condition 29, then -</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>(a) ...</p>\n\n  <p>(b) <i>without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to him at law or in equity</i>,\n\n  the Vendor may:\u00a0</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>(i) forfeit and retain for his own benefit the deposit paid by the Purchaser, and\u00a0</p>\n\n    <p>(ii) resell the property whether by auction or by private treaty without previously tendering\n\n    a conveyance to the Purchaser.\u00a0</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p>[Emphasis is ours]</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not seriously disputed by Mr Peter. We think that Mr Pereira is probably right. We would\n\nsay in passing that condition 29 was itself modelled on condition 19 of the English Law Society's\n\nGeneral Conditions of Sale: see <i>The Singapore Law Society's Conditions of Sale 1981</i> by Mr C C\n\nTan (1982) MLJ xxxix. The same words 'without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to\n\nhim at law or equity' are also contained in condition 22 of the English National Conditions of Sale.\n\nThese words in the context of condition 19 of The Law Society's General Conditions of Sale and\n\ncondition 22 of the National Conditions of Sale have been construed by the courts in England in the\n\nthree cases relied upon by Mr Pereira, to which we shall refer in a moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Construction of Clause 5(3)</strong></p>\n\n<p>19. Having traced the historical evolution of cl 5(3) to the form now under consideration, we\n\nturn to consider how the words 'without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in\n\nequity' in the context of cl 5(3) should be construed.</p>\n\n<p>20. Mr Pereira's submission is that when cl 5(3) is validly invoked these words merely give to\n\nthe developer an option to elect either to claim damages at common law or to claim the amounts under\n\nparagraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3). Thus, in this case Allgreen had that right of election, and since\n\nthey had exercised their rights under cl 5(3), they were entitled only to the sums stated in\n\nparagraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3) and were not entitled, in addition, to damages at common law. In\n\nsupport, he relies on the three English cases.</p>\n\n<p>21. Mr Peter, on the other hand, submits that when cl 5(3) is validly invoked and the contract is\n\nannulled, as was the case here, the vendor is entitled to forfeit the 20% of the purchase price\n\nunder clause 5(3)(c) and this right is exercisable, in the words of cl 5(3), 'without prejudice to\n\nany other rights available to [the vendor] at law or in equity'. It follows that, if the amount\n\nforfeited exceeds the actual loss or damage suffered by the vendor, the latter may retain the\n\nsurplus. But, if the amount forfeited is insufficient to cover the loss, the vendor is entitled to\n\nrecover from the purchaser the amount of loss over and above the amount forfeited. Therefore, in the\n\ninstant case, as the loss sustained by Allgreen exceeded the sum forfeited, they were entitled to\n\nclaim the excess amount as well.</p>\n\n<p>22. We turn first to consider the cases relied upon by Mr Pereira. In <i>Talley and Anor v\n\nWolsey-Neech</i> (1979) 38 P&amp;CR 45, the plaintiffs agreed to sell a house to the defendant for\n\n55,000 and the defendant paid a deposit of 5,500. The sale and purchase agreement incorporated\n\nThe Law Society's General Conditions of Sale (1973 rev.), of which condition 19, so far as material,\n\nreads:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>19(2) If the sale shall not be completed on the date fixed for completion either party may on\n\n  that date or at any time thereafter  give to the other party notice in writing to complete the\n\n  transaction in accordance with this condition \u00a0</p>\n\n  <p>19(3) \u00a0</p>\n\n  <p>19(4) If the purchaser does not comply with the terms of an effective notice served by the\n\n  vendor under this condition, then - \u00a0</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>(b) <i>without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to him at law or in equity</i>,\n\n    the vendor may -\u00a0</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n\n      <p>(i) forfeit and retain for his own benefit the deposit paid by the purchaser, and\u00a0</p>\n\n      <p>(ii) resell the property whether by auction or by private treaty without previously\n\n      tendering a conveyance to the purchaser,\u00a0</p>\n\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>(c) if on any such re-sale contracted within one year from the date fixed for completion the\n\n    vendor incurs a loss, the purchaser shall pay to the vendor as <i>liquidated damages</i> the\n\n    amount of such loss, which shall include all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in any such\n\n    re-sale or any attempted re-sale, subject to the vendor giving credit for any deposit and any\n\n    money paid on account of the purchase price, but any surplus money shall be retained by the\n\n    vendor. [Emphases is ours]</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The defendant failed to complete on the date fixed for completion. The plaintiffs served on him\n\nthe requisite notice to complete under condition 19(4) but the purchaser still failed to complete,\n\nand in consequence the vendor resold the house. The house fetched a price, which was 4,000 below\n\nthe price at which the defendant contracted to pay. The plaintiffs brought an action against the\n\ndefendant claiming:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>(i) 4,000, being the reduction of price on resale.\u00a0</p>\n\n  <p>(ii) costs and expenses in effecting the resale, and\u00a0</p>\n\n  <p>(iii) interest on the amount of the purchase price which should have been paid by the\n\n  defendant, for the period stretching from the date when the defendant should have completed to the\n\n  date of completion of the resale.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Court of Appeal held that the third head of damage, i.e. the interest, was not recoverable,\n\nsince it did not fall within the scope of condition 19(4). Browne LJ held at pp 51-53:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>When a buyer defaults by failing to complete on the due date after time has been made of the\n\n  essence of the contract, the seller can choose between various rights and remedies .</p>\n\n  <p> If he decides to sue for damages, he can choose whether to sell or not, and the measure of\n\n  damages will be different according to his choice.\u00a0</p>\n\n  <p>In my view, the object and effect of the opening words of condition 19(4)(b) [i.e.\n\n  \"without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to him at law or in\n\n  equity\"] are to make it clear that these rights of choice are preserved to the seller, but,\n\n  if he chooses to exercise his rights and remedies under condition 19(4)(c), he can, in my view,\n\n  only do so in accordance with and within the limits of the provisions of this condition.\u00a0</p>\n\n  <p> If, as [counsel for the vendor] suggests, the effect of condition 19(4)(c) were merely to\n\n  provide machinery for the simple quantification of one element in the damages at common law, it\n\n  could and would have been very differently worded. It seems to me that the words \"liquidated\n\n  damages\" are conclusive.\u00a0</p>\n\n  <p>In my judgment, the plaintiffs, having chosen to exercise their rights and remedies under\n\n  condition 19(4)(c), are only entitled to recover the \"liquidated damages\" defined by\n\n  that condition \u00a0</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>23. The next case is <i>Wallace-Turner v Cole</i> (1983) 46 P&amp;CR 164. There, the plaintiff\n\nagreed to sell a flat to the purchaser and the agreement incorporated the National Conditions of\n\nSale, 19th ed (1976). Condition 22(3) provided that if, on the purchaser failing to complete, the\n\nvendor resold the property within the 12 months stated therein, the vendor would be entitled, on\n\ncrediting the deposit, to recover from the purchaser 'the amount of loss occasioned to the vendor by\n\nexpenses of or incidental to such resale, or by diminution of the price'. The purchaser failed to\n\ncomplete, in spite of the notice to complete under condition 22. The plaintiff contracted to resell\n\nthe flat and issued a writ claiming the diminution of the price as the measure of his loss. That\n\ncontract, however, was not completed. Subsequently the plaintiff resold the flat and claimed 9,600\n\nbeing the diminution in the price of the flat. It was held, inter alia, that under the terms of\n\ncondition 22(3) the vendor was put to his election between liquidated damages under the condition\n\nand unliquidated damages at large for loss of bargain and breach of contract and that when the\n\nplaintiff took judgment for the unliquidated damages, he opted for unliquidated damages. Mr John\n\nMowbray QC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, said at p 167:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>In my judgment <i>Talley v Wolsey-Neech</i> shows that a vendor cannot recover both a\n\n  contractual sum under such a condition as condition 22 and damages for the delay. The conditions\n\n  there were the Law Society's General Conditions of Sale (1975 rev.), and they referred to the sum\n\n  expressly as \"liquidated damages,\" and the Court of appeal relied on those words; but in\n\n  my judgment the sum payable under condition 22 of the National Conditions of Sale was also\n\n  liquidated damages and that does not distinguish <i>Talley v Wolsey-Neech</i>.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The learned judge further said at p 168:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>... The basis of the decision in <i>Talley v Wolsey-Neech</i>, as I understand it, is that a\n\n  vendor is put to his election between his different remedies. It is common ground between counsel\n\n  that he is put to an election between damages and specific performance. <i>Talley v Wolsey-Neech</i>\n\n  is, in my view, a decision that he is likewise put to his election between liquidated damages\n\n  under this kind of condition and unliquidated damages at large for loss of bargain and breach of\n\n  contract.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>24. The third case relied on by Mr Pereira is <i>Sakkas and Anor v Donford Ltd</i> (1983) 46\n\nP&amp;CR 290, which was decided Mr Grantchester QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court judge. In that\n\ncase, the defendant purchased the property at a public auction and the contract incorporated the\n\nNational Conditions of Sale (19th ed). Subsequently the purchaser refused to complete the contract\n\non discovering certain material information relating to the property which was not disclosed in the\n\nparticulars of the property at the auction. The learned judge held that the purchaser was entitled\n\nto rescind the contract on the ground that the vendor had failed to disclose the material\n\ninformation concerning the property and that the particulars of the property furnished by the vendor\n\ncontained information which was untrue to the knowledge of the vendor. However, he went further to\n\nconsider the question of damages, should the claim of the vendor be upheld. In that connection, he\n\nconsidered condition 22(3) of the National Conditions of Sale and following <i>Talley v\n\nWoolsley-Neech</i> held at p 309:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>...In my view that case is authority for the proposition that where a vendor elects to proceed\n\n  under a condition similar to the condition in that case, what he then obtains thereunder is only\n\n  the difference between the initial sale price and the re-sale price and the costs of the re-sale.\n\n  Condition 22 of the National Conditions of Sale (19th ed.) in the present case, although the words\n\n  \"as liquidated damages\" do not appear therein, says that after a notice to complete such\n\n  as was given in this case, then the purchaser's deposit may be forfeited and the vendor can\n\n  re-sell. Thereupon the condition provides that the vendor shall be entitled upon crediting the\n\n  deposit to recover from the purchaser thereunder the amount of any loss occasioned by the vendor\n\n  by expenses of or incidental to such re-sale or by diminution in the price. Such condition, as I\n\n  read it, in the circumstances that happened in this case, indicates that the rights of the\n\n  plaintiffs on the re-sale at 12,000 are only to claim for the 2,300 shortfall, plus the costs\n\n  of the re-sale of 258.75.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>25. For completeness, we should mention that about a month before the decision in <i>Sakkas</i>,\n\na different conclusion was arrived at in the case of <i>Bruce v Waziri </i>(1983) 46 P&amp;CR 81.\n\nThere, the plaintiff entered into a contract to sell her house to the defendant and the contract\n\nincorporated the National Conditions of Sale, 19th ed (1976). The purchaser failed to complete on\n\nthe date fixed for completion and the vendor gave him a notice to complete under condition 22 but\n\nthe purchaser still failed to complete. The vendor treated the contract as discharged and resold the\n\nproperty at a lesser price resulting in a loss of 42,500. The vendor claimed against the purchaser\n\nspecial damages for the loss occasioned. In allowing the claim, Mr Julian Jeffs QC, sitting as a\n\nDeputy High Court judge, distinguished the case before him from <i>Talley v Woolsley-Neech</i> on\n\nthe ground that the two conditions, namely condition 22 of the National Conditions of Sale and\n\ncondition 19 of The Law Society's General Conditions of Sale, are different. He held at pp\n\n86-87:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>If, on a proper construction of condition 22 of the National Conditions of Sale, which govern\n\n  the contract in this case, the same provision occurs as was contained in The Law Society's\n\n  Conditions of Sale which were under consideration in <i>Talley v Wolsey-Neech</i>, that is\n\n  decisive of the matter. The plaintiff has her remedy according to that condition and none other.</p>\n\n  <p>However, in my judgment, the two conditions cannot be equated and condition 22 of the National\n\n  Conditions of Sale does not provide a remedy limited to liquidated damages. I can emphasise this\n\n  by going back to the specific wording of the conditions in question. Looking at condition 19(4) of\n\n  The Law Society's General Conditions of Sale as set out in <i>Talley v Wolsey-Neech</i>, which I\n\n  have already read, it is to be noted that there are three sub-paragraphs to condition\n\n  19(4)....\u00a0 Paragraph (c) reads: \"if on any resale contracted within one year from the\n\n  date fixed for completion the vendor incurs a loss, the purchaser shall\" - (it is mandatory)\n\n  - \"pay to the vendor as liquidated damages,\" certain sums which are there set out. I\n\n  emphasise the words \"shall\" and \" as liquidated damages.\" \u00a0</p>\n\n  <p>On my construction of paragraph (3), <i>the words</i> \"without prejudice to any other\n\n  right or remedy available to the vendor\" govern the whole of it, and the last section is put\n\n  in to clarify the vendor's entitlement in respect of certain heads if the property is resold. I\n\n  accordingly hold in this case that the two conditions are distinguishable and that the plaintiff\n\n  is entitled to recover the special damages which she claims.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>26. We do not find these English cases of any assistance in our construction of cl 5(3) of the\n\nAgreement. There is a material difference between, on the one hand, the context in which the words\n\n'without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to him [the vendor] at law or in\n\nequity' are set out in condition 19(4) of The Law Society's General Conditions of Sale and condition\n\n22(3) of the National Conditions of Sale and, on the other hand, the context in which a similar\n\nwording is set out in cl 5(3) of the Agreement. For this purpose, we need to revisit the material\n\nwording of condition 19(4) which is as follows:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>19(4) If the purchaser does not comply with the terms of an effective notice served by the\n\n  vendor under this condition, then -\u00a0</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>(a) ..\u00a0</p>\n\n    <p>(b) <i>without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to him at law or in equity</i>,\n\n    the vendor may -\u00a0</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n\n      <p>(i) forfeit and retain for his own benefit the deposit paid by the purchaser, and\u00a0</p>\n\n      <p>(ii) resell the property whether by auction or by private treaty without previously\n\n      tendering a conveyance to the purchaser,\u00a0</p>\n\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>(c) if on any such re-sale contracted within one year ..the vendor incurs a loss, the\n\n    purchaser shall pay to the vendor as <i>liquidated damages</i> the amount of such loss, which\n\n    shall include .., subject to the vendor giving credit for any deposit and any money paid on\n\n    account of the purchase price, but any surplus money shall be retained by the vendor.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With the condition so structured, it is plain that, if and when condition 19(4) applies, the\n\nwords 'without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to [the vendor] at law or in\n\nequity' operate to give the vendor the options available to him at law or in equity. Accordingly,\n\nthe vendor has the option of (a) treating the contract as still subsisting and pursuing a claim for\n\nspecific performance and damages in addition or in lieu thereof, or (b) treating the contract as\n\nhaving been repudiated and (i) claiming unliquidated damages at large for loss of bargain and breach\n\nof contractor, or (ii) claiming the amounts under paragraphs (b) and (c) of condition 19(4). The\n\nsame position applies to condition 22(3) of the National Conditions of Sale: <i>Wallace-Turner v\n\nCole</i> and <i>Sakkas v Dunford </i>(supra).</p>\n\n<p>27. Turning to cl 5(3), we find that the entire clause is differently structured and the context\n\nin which the words 'without prejudice to any other rights available to him at law or in equity' are\n\nset out is different. At the risk of repetition, the material part of cl 5(3) is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>(3) If ., the Vendor shall be entitled at its option on giving to the Purchaser or his\n\n  solicitors not less than twenty-one (21) days' notice in writing to treat this Agreement as having\n\n  been repudiated by the Purchaser and (unless in the meanwhile the unpaid instalments and interest\n\n  shall have been paid) this Agreement shall at the expiration of such notice (and in this respect\n\n  time shall be of the essence) be annulled and in such an event, without prejudice to any other\n\n  rights available to him at law or in equity, the Vendor shall be entitled:-\u00a0</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p>(a) to resell.\u00a0</p>\n\n    <p>(b) to recover all interest calculated ..\u00a0</p>\n\n    <p>(c) to forfeit and retain ..twenty (20%) per cent of the purchase price from the\n\n    instalments ..</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, as and when such clause is validly invoked, the agreement is 'is annulled' and is at an\n\nend. In that event, the consequences set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) apply and the words\n\n'without prejudice to any other rights available to [the vendor] at law or in equity' has a narrower\n\nscope. In our opinion, these words in the context in which they are set out do not operate to give\n\nto the vendor an option or a right to elect either to claim for unliquidated damages at large or to\n\nclaim the sums stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3). In the context in which they are set out\n\nthey cannot be construed in the manner in which similar words in condition 19(4) of The Law\n\nSociety's General Conditions of Sale or condition 22(3) of the National Conditions of Sale have been\n\nconstrued in those cases which we have discussed.</p>\n\n<p>28. It is eminently clear that the purpose of the Housing Developers Rules and the forms and\n\ncontents of the sale agreements prescribed thereunder are intended for the protection of purchasers\n\nof housing units developed and sold by developers. The Housing Developers Rules, since they were\n\nfirst enacted, contain restrictions on the rights of the developers with regard both to the form and\n\nthe terms of the contract which they are at liberty to make with their purchasers. The statutory\n\nforms of contract prescribed by the Rules dictate, among other things, the number and the amount of\n\ninstalments of the purchase price which a developer is allowed to receive from a purchaser at\n\ndifferent stages of the construction, the period of the notice required to be given for calling such\n\npayments, the rates of interest the developer is entitled to charge for any default in the payment\n\nof any instalment, the period required to be given to a purchaser before the developer is entitled\n\nto treat the agreement as having been repudiated and to annul it, and the measure of damages the\n\ndeveloper is entitled to recover from the purchaser.</p>\n\n<p>29. For these reasons, it could not have been the intention of the legislature to provide to the\n\ndeveloper by cl 5(3) a right to claim damages at common law, in addition to their rights to recover\n\nthe amounts under paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3) as contended by Mr Peter. Nor, in our opinion,\n\ncould it have been intended to provide the developer an option to elect either to claim damages at\n\ncommon law or to proceed to recover the amounts under paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3) as contended\n\nby Mr Pereira. In our opinion, as and when cl 5(3) is validly invoked and the agreement is annulled,\n\nthe rights of the developer to the amount of damages which he is entitled to recover from the\n\npurchaser is confined to paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3). That is the measure of damages the\n\ndeveloper is entitled to. He is not entitled to claim damages for breach of contract at common law\n\nand recover more than what he would be entitled under cl 5(3). We are reinforced in our conclusion\n\nby the presence of cl 5(4), which unequivocally provides:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>The balance of the instalments prepaid by the Purchasers after making deductions in accordance\n\n  with paragraph (3)(b) and (c) shall be refunded to the Purchaser.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By reason of this sub-clause, the vendor is under an express obligation to refund the purchase\n\nmoneys after making the deductions specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3). This means that\n\nthe vendor can only keep what has been deducted under clause 5(3).</p>\n\n<p>30. Turning to the words 'without prejudice to any other rights available to the vendor at law or\n\nin equity', we are of the opinion that they are intended to preserve to the developer 'other rights'\n\nhe may have, such as his right to payment of other sums which has accrued under the agreement: see <i>Lim\n\nLay Bee and Anor v Allgreen Properties Ltd</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47663&amp;freetext=\">[1999] 1 SLR 471</a>. The words 'other rights' mean\n\nrights other than the rights to damages which the developer is entitled to recover under paragraphs\n\n(b) and (c) of cl 5(3) of the Agreement.</p>\n\n<p>31. It is also instructive to refer briefly to <i>Lim Lay Bee</i>. The case concerned another\n\napartment of the same development 'Springdale Condominium' and involved the same developers, namely,\n\nAllgreen. There, the purchaser had paid only the booking fee which was 5% of the purchase price.\n\nUnder the agreement, the first instalment payable was 20% of the purchase price, which included the\n\n5% already paid. The purchaser defaulted in payment of the balance of the first instlament ('the\n\nbalance sum') and also a subsequent instalment. Allgreen therefore served on the purchaser an\n\nannulment notice under cl 5(3) of the agreement, and thereafter commenced proceedings against him\n\nclaiming the balance sum due and two other sums representing interests due. It was held by the Court\n\nof Appeal that Allgreen's right to payment of the balance sum under cl 3(1) accrued prior to the\n\ntermination of the agreement; that reading cl 3(1)(a) and cl 5(3)(c) together this right survived\n\nthe termination of the agreement; and that Allgreen were entitled to recover this amount and forfeit\n\nit. In the course of the judgment the Court said obiter at \u00a011:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>Loh's defaults in payment of the instalments, the respondents in exercise of their rights under\n\n  cl 5(3) annulled and terminated the agreement, and their rights and remedies in such an event are\n\n  governed by cl 5(3) which is quite explicit and specific: it provides that 'without prejudice to\n\n  any other rights available to' them, they are entitled to the rights as set out in paras a) to c)\n\n  of that clause. In so far as the monetary compensation is concerned, the respondents are entitled,\n\n  first, under para (b) to 'recover from the instalments (excluding payments of interest) previously\n\n  paid by the Purchaser' the interest on the overdue instalments, and secondly, under para (c) to\n\n  forfeit and retain, also from the instalments (excluding payments of interest) previously paid by\n\n  the Purchaser' a sum equal to 20% of the purchase price. The respondents are thus empowered to\n\n  have recourse to the sums previously paid under cl 3(1) for the purpose of satisfying the two\n\n  amounts under paras (b) and (c) of cl 5(3)</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>32. In our judgment, as the Agreement had been annulled under cl 5(3), Allgreen were entitled to\n\npayment of the amounts under paragraphs (b) and (c) of cl 5(3). They were also entitled to be paid\n\nby Mr Hakim the outstanding maintenance charges and property tax, as their rights to these sums had\n\naccrued prior to the termination of the Agreement. Subject to payment of these sums, Allgreen are\n\nobliged to refund to Mr Hakim the balance of the instalments paid under the Agreement.</p>\n\n<p>33. We therefore allow the appeal with costs here and below, and set aside the judgment below.\n\nAllgreen were obliged to refund to Mr Hakim the sum of $440,919.07. It appears that Allgreen had\n\nrefunded to Mr Hakim the sum of $399,259.87. That being the case, there will be judgment for Mr\n\nHakim for the refund of the balance. The deposit in court, with interest, if any, is to be refunded\n\nto Mr Hakim or his solicitors.</p>\n\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"80%\">\n\n  <tr>\n\n    <td width=\"33%\" align=\"center\">- Sgd -<br/>\n\n      <strong>YONG PUNG HOW</strong></td>\n\n    <td width=\"33%\" align=\"center\">- Sgd -<br/>\n\n      <strong>L P THEAN</strong></td>\n\n    <td width=\"34%\" align=\"center\">- Sgd -<br/>\n\n      <strong>CHAO HICK TIN</strong></td>\n\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n\n    <td width=\"33%\" align=\"center\"><strong>Chief Justice</strong></td>\n\n    <td width=\"33%\" align=\"center\"><strong>Judge of Appeal</strong></td>\n\n    <td width=\"34%\" align=\"center\"><strong>Judge of Appeal</strong></td>\n\n  </tr>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Date: 13 September 2001</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We hold that in a case where a solvent company does not admit the debt and is prepared to offer security to defend the claim, the court should not as a matter of principle, in the exercise of its discretion, allow a claimant to file a winding up petition against the solvent company, with all the potentially disastrous consequences that may result from the filing of the petition. It is inappropriate to use the threat of winding up to force a company to pay the unadmitted debt, in such circumstances.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Accordingly, we make the following orders:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(a)<span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> \u00a0the appeal is dismissed with costs, with the usual consequential orders;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(b)<span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> \u00a0the injunction is continued subject to JSPL providing security for the amount of BNP\u2019s claim (as per the statutory demand dated 20\u00a0November 2007) in a form to be agreed between the parties within 14\u00a0days from today, failing which we will make the requisite order; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(c)<span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> \u00a0if BNP fails to commence an action against JSPL within 12 weeks from the date hereof, the security shall be cancelled or returned to JSPL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0We express no views on the findings of Lee Seiu Kin\u00a0J that JSPL has raised triable issues to the claim of BNP.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now elaborate on why it was wrong of BNP to have threatened to resort to winding-up proceedings against JSPL in order to recover a contested debt instead of accepting the security offered by JSPL pending the resolution of BNP\u2019s claim through court proceedings. In our brief grounds, we held that JSPL was entirely justified in applying for an injunction to restrain BNP from filing the petition. Although JSPL filed the petition on the ground that there were triable issues with respect to BNP\u2019s claim for the US$50m crystallised loss, it was also our view that the condition of triable issues was not even necessary to justify the injunction. We will now elaborate on our conclusions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The court\u2019s power to wind up a company</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We examine first the court\u2019s statutory power to wind up a company under the Companies Act (Cap\u00a050, 2006\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d). Section\u00a0253(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Act provides that \u201c[a] company \u2026 <i>may</i> be wound up under an order of the Court on the application of any creditor, including a contingent or prospective creditor, of the company\u201d [emphasis added]. Section\u00a0254(1)(<i>e</i>) provides that the court may order the winding up of a company if it is unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts in the circumstances prescribed by s\u00a0254(2) of the Act as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A company shall be deemed to be unable to pay its debts if \u2014</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>a</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a creditor by assignment or otherwise to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding $10,000 then due has served on the company by leaving at the registered office a demand under his hand or under the hand of his agent thereunto lawfully authorised requiring the company to pay the sum so due, <i>and the company has for 3 weeks thereafter</i> <i>neglected to pay the sum <b>or to</b></i> <b><i>secure</i></b> <i>or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor</i>;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>b</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of any court in favour of a creditor of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>c</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it is <i>proved</i> to the satisfaction of the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts; and in determining whether a company is unable to pay its debts the Court shall take into account the contingent and prospective liabilities of the company.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis in italics and bold italics added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of this case, the following points may be noted with regard to the combined effect of ss\u00a0253(1)(<i>b</i>) and 254(2). First, the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cshall\u201d indicates a discretionary power in the court to order a winding up (see [15] below). Second, a creditor may be an actual, contingent or prospective creditor (see [6] below). Third, the court <i>may</i> wind up a company under s\u00a0254(1)(<i>e</i>) only if the latter is unable to pay its debts (see [7] below). Fourth, the creditor has to prove that the company is unable to pay its debts, and it can do so by adducing evidence of actual inability to pay its debts (s\u00a0254(2)(<i>c</i>)) or evidence of a deemed inability to pay its debts (s\u00a0254(2)(<i>a</i>)) (see [7] below). Fifth, to prove a deemed inability under s\u00a0254(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act, it is necessary for the creditor to have a \u201cdue\u201d debt, which the debtor has for three weeks neglected to pay <i>or to secure</i> or compound to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor, after it has been served with a statutory notice to pay. If the creditor claims that the security is not satisfactory and is determined to issue winding-up proceedings, the debtor may then apply to court for a restraining order so as to enable the court to determine on an objective basis what the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor should be (see [9] below).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking the second point first, in the present case, BNP took the position that it was an existing, and not a contingent or prospective, creditor with respect to the US$50m crystallised loss on the ground that the terms of the close-out agreement mentioned at [4] of our brief grounds (see [2] above) were such that JSPL had agreed to make payment for the crystallised loss of US$50m. Given the points we have highlighted, it was clear why BNP had to rely on s\u00a0254(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act rather than s\u00a0254(2)(<i>c</i>), given that JSPL had offered to place US$50m in escrow. This was a patent indication that JSPL was both able and willing to pay in the event that the court determined that it was liable to do so. In other words, JSPL was not an insolvent company.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This impediment, <i>viz</i>, the fact that JSPL was in reality not an insolvent company but yet refused to admit BNP\u2019s claim, led the latter to use a shortcut by the backdoor to try to enforce a contested claim by issuing a s\u00a0254(2)(<i>a</i>) statutory notice and threatening JSPL with winding up unless it made payment. In our view, had a winding-up petition been filed, it would have amounted to an abuse of the court\u2019s winding-up jurisdiction. First, winding-up proceedings are intended only for cases where the company is insolvent or deemed to be insolvent. In the present case, BNP could not have proved that JSPL was insolvent because the fact was that it was not insolvent, and this was easily confirmed by its offer to secure BNP\u2019s claim for the crystallised loss, even though it did not admit that it was liable for the loss. Second, BNP also could not prove a deemed inability to pay on the part of JSPL without first requiring the winding-up court to determine whether the latter was liable for the claim in the first place. In this regard, we note that the second statutory demand for payment (the first being withdrawn) was issued after the offer of security was made. In essence, BNP was seeking to invoke the court\u2019s winding-up jurisdiction to adjudicate on a disputed claim. Thus, it follows that there was no legal basis whatsoever for BNP to threaten to file a winding-up petition against JSPL. JSPL was not an insolvent company and BNP ought to have commenced court proceedings instead, as it is settled law that the court\u2019s winding-up jurisdiction is not for the purpose of deciding a disputed debt; see <i>Mann v Goldstein</i> [1968] 1\u00a0WLR 1091, where Ungoed-Thomas\u00a0J said (at 1098\u20131099):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">For my part, I would prefer to rest the jurisdiction directly on the comparatively simple propositions that a creditor\u2019s petition can only be presented by a creditor, <i>that the winding-up jurisdiction is not for the purpose of deciding a disputed debt</i> (that is, disputed on substantial and not insubstantial grounds), since, until a creditor is established as a creditor he is not entitled to present the petition and has no locus standi in the Companies Court \u2026 [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Although this passage contains the qualification that the debt must be disputed on substantial grounds and not on insubstantial grounds (which is BNP\u2019s case <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> JSPL), it should be remembered that Ungoed-Thomas\u00a0J\u2019s statement of principle was made in the context of a disputed debt <i>where the debtor did not make any offer to secure the disputed debt.</i> Where such an offer has been made, the issue of substantiality or insubstantiality falls by the wayside as it is no longer a relevant consideration given that the debtor is not unable to pay its debts. That is why, in our view, the issue of whether there were triable issues with respect to BNP\u2019s claim was not even relevant in the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Re Yet Kai Construction Co Ltd</i> <nobr>[2000] HKEC 186</nobr> (transcript available on Westlaw), Deputy Judge Woolley, in striking out a petition to wind up a company, based on a disputed debt, for abuse of process, made the following observations:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">However, before leaving the matter I am bound to comment on the course adopted by the petitioner here. Having what they believed was a good claim against the respondent, they had a choice of possible actions to take: they could bring an action in the Court of First Instance, with an application under Order\u00a014 for judgment if they thought their claim was unanswerable; they could, and under the provisions of the sub-contract, should, have referred their dispute to arbitration; or they could, as they have done here, serve a statutory demand followed by a petition to wind up the respondent. There is no evidence that they thought that the respondent was insolvent, or otherwise unable to pay, and the first two options, should their claim prove good, would have accordingly resulted in payment being made. The option chosen, however, if allowed to proceed to its logical conclusion, would probably result in the destruction of the respondent as a viable entity. The presentation of the petition alone can do, and no doubt has done here, considerable damage to the respondent\u2019s business and the goodwill of its customers. It is for this reason that the courts regard the use of such a procedure as a debt collecting operation, to put pressure on a company to pay, or to settle on terms which it might not otherwise have to, as something which should be discouraged in the strongest terms. There has been no explanation given to me why the petitioner chose this course, with its potentially devastating effect on the respondent, rather than another course which would have recovered a debt, if properly owed, without affecting the respondent\u2019s other business.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We agree.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taking the fifth point next (see [5] above), even in the case of an admitted debt, the debtor company is not deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it has not neglected to secure the debt demanded under the statutory notice. In our view, the legal position must be <i>a fortiori</i> where the company does not admit the claim but offers to provide security. Although this situation is not expressly covered under s\u00a0254(2)(<i>a</i>), it was in our view a compelling reason for this court to restrain BNP from filing a winding-up petition against JSPL. A debtor which has offered security is not deemed to be unable to pay its debts, and there is no reason why an alleged debtor who has offered the same ought to be treated any differently. In the circumstances, even if BNP had filed such a petition, the fact that adequate security had been offered would have been a compelling reason to dismiss the petition.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, we had no doubt that if BNP had filed a winding-up petition against JSPL in the circumstances of this case, the winding-up court would have dismissed the petition, in the exercise of its discretion, on the ground that it was an abuse of process as BNP would not have been able to prove that JSPL was unable or deemed to be unable to pay its debts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The statutory demand</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is one issue in relation to the fifth point that was not argued before us. The point is whether the statutory demand requires the creditor to state that the debtor must be informed of the option of securing or compounding for the debt. It is a statutory requirement under the corresponding law in England, and also in Australia since June 1993. In both jurisdictions, the petitioner is required to inform the debtor company that he can either pay the debt or secure or compound for it to the creditor\u2019s satisfaction. There is, however, no such requirement under the Act or the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap\u00a050, R\u00a01, 2006\u00a0Rev Ed).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in <i>Consolidated Press (Finance) Ltd v Australian Horticultural Finance Pty Ltd</i> (1992) 108\u00a0ALR 402, which was decided prior to the change in the law in Australia, Lockhart\u00a0J of the Federal Court of Australia held (at 403) that even though:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 the terms of s\u00a0460(2)(a) do not require the notice to specify that, if the company has for three weeks after service of the notice failed to pay the sum or to secure or to compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor, winding up proceedings will be brought. Despite the lack of an express requirement to do so in my view, it is necessary to place in the notice the alternatives of securing or compounding the debt. This view is premised on two bases. First, it certainly is the convention, and has been so for many years, that the statutory demand is drawn in such a form as to indicate all these matters to the recipient. Secondly, for the notice to comply with its fundamental purpose mentioned earlier, it must state each of the three options. Accordingly, each notice is bad.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, BNP sent a statutory demand in the following terms:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>TAKE FURTHER NOTICE</b>\u00a0that this is a statutory letter of demand for payment, made for and on behalf of our clients and in this regard, unless the said sum of <b>USD50,723,070</b> is paid to our clients or to us as their solicitors within <b>twenty-one (21) days</b> from the date of this letter, you are deemed unable to pay your debts pursuant to Section<span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0254(2)(a) of the Companies Act (Cap.\u00a050) and our clients sh</span>all forthwith be entitled to present a winding-up petition in the High Court for a winding<span lang=\"EN-GB\">-</span>up order to be made against you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear that, whether or not there is a requirement to spell out all the three options, the terms of the demand were misleading in stating that JSPL would be deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it did not pay the sum demanded within 21 days. If the statutory demand did not comply with s\u00a0254(2)(<i>a</i>), and on the assumption that substantial injustice would be caused such that s\u00a0392 of the Act could not apply to remedy the non-compliance, it would follow that JSPL would not have been deemed to be unable to pay its debts pursuant to that subsection, and it would have been entitled to the injunction on the terms prayed for. However, since this point was not argued, we will leave it to be raised at another time in another case.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The court\u2019s discretion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This brings us to the first point concerning the discretionary power of the court not to wind up even a company which is proved or deemed to be unable to pay its debts. The general rule is that, where a company is unable or deemed to be unable to pay its debts, the creditor is <i>prima facie</i> entitled to a winding-up order <i>ex debito justitiae</i> (see <i>Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2007] 2 SLR 268</nobr> (\u201c<i>Metalform</i>\u201d) at [61]). This proposition can be traced to Lord Cranworth\u2019s statement in <i>Bowes v The Hope Life Insurance and Guarantee Company</i> (1865) 11\u00a0HLC 389; 11\u00a0ER 1383, where he said, at 402; 1389:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]t is not a discretionary matter with the Court when a debt is established, and not satisfied, to say whether the company shall be wound up or not; that is to say, if there be a valid debt established, valid both at law and in equity. <i>One does not like to say positively that no case could occur in which it would be right to refuse it</i>; but ordinarily speaking, it is the duty of the Court to direct the winding up. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first part of Lord Cranworth\u2019s statement is, however, qualified by the second part of the statement that there could be exceptional cases where the court would not grant a winding-up order. The relevant statutory provision under which the court was vested with the power to wind up insolvent companies in 1865 in England contained the same phrase \u201cmay order the company to be wound up\u201d which has been enacted in s\u00a0254 of the Act. In construing a similar provision in the Companies Act 1948 (c\u00a038) (UK), Buckley\u00a0LJ (with whom the other two members, <i>viz</i>, Bridge and Templeman\u00a0LLJ, agreed) stated, in <i>In</i>\u00a0<i>re Southard &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1979] 1\u00a0WLR 1198 at 1203\u20131204:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr. Lindsay accepts that an unpaid petitioning creditor in respect of an undisputed debt is entitled to expect the court to exercise its discretion in his favour in the absence of special circumstances. Both section\u00a0222 of the Act of 1948, which is the section conferring the jurisdiction to wind up a company compulsorily, and section\u00a0346 (1) are expressed in permissive language; in each case the verb used is \u201cmay\u201d. <i>In every case, Mr. Lindsay submits, the court has an unfettered discretion, and in my judgment that is the true view of the situation.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This matter was discussed in <i>In re P. &amp; J.

At [84], this court said:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A creditor\u2019s winding-up petition implies insolvency and is likely to damage the company\u2019s creditworthiness or financial standing with its other creditors or customers. In the contemporary business environment, practically all businesses are financed in varying degrees by debt. \u2026 Modern loan arrangements inevitably contain financial covenants which, if breached, might trigger other cross-default clauses. The presentation of a winding-up petition against the company is invariably such an event of default. In the present case, it would appear that [the debtor company in <i>Metalform</i>] would have 60 days to set aside a winding-up petition to avoid a default that would enable the bank to recall its loan. If other cross-default clauses are triggered, it would merely compound the company\u2019s problems. The prospect of the company\u2019s business being ruined in this way is very real.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, where the company is a member of a group enterprise, as in the present case, the filing of a winding-up petition could immediately, or subsequently,</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">if it is not set aside or withdrawn within a specified period of time, trigger a series of cross-defaults under financial arrangements entered into by that company or other companies within the group. It would therefore not be an exaggeration to say that an entire business group could be put at risk of being pushed into a state of insolvency by the mere presentation of a winding-up petition.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where a petition to wind up a temporarily insolvent but commercially viable company is filed, many other economic and social interests may be affected, such as those of its employees, the non-petitioning creditors, as well as the company\u2019s suppliers, customers and shareholders. These are interests that the court may legitimately take into account in deciding whether or not to wind up the company. In <i>Pilecon Engineering Bhd v Remaja Jaya Sdn Bhd</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 MLJ 808</nobr>, the High Court of Malaysia said, at 813 (in respect of a creditor\u2019s petition to wind up a company), that \u201c<i>[n]ot only should the court consider the interest of the creditors, the court should also consider the interest of the public at large</i>\u201d [emphasis added]. There, the petitioner had obtained judgment against the respondent company, which was in the business of developing residential property. In staying the petition for a period of one year, the court took into account the fact that the majority of the unsecured creditors were opposed to the winding up, and added (<i>ibid</i>) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Recovering an abandoned housing project is akin to injecting life into the community in that area. Out of that one project much benefit could accrue to the community. Schools will emerge, public utilities will be provided and the general upliftment of life will no doubt bring harmony and contentment, thus nurturing a satisfied society. If another opportunity can be given to the [receivers and managers] to revive this abandoned project, so be it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We agree with the above decision in so far as the public\u2019s interest could be taken into account in deciding whether to wind up a company. This is especially so if the company is a viable one. Under s\u00a0257(1) of the Act, the court may adjourn the hearing of a winding-up application conditionally or unconditionally or make any interim or other order that it thinks fit. In cases where a company is temporarily insolvent but the winding-up court would <i>ex hypothesi</i> grant an adjournment under s\u00a0257(1) of the Act to allow the company time to resolve the issues at hand or to seek alternative measures, an injunction of limited duration to restrain a winding-up petition from being presented may also be justified if irreparable harm could flow from its presentation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our brief grounds, we held that, as</span> a matter of principle, the court should not, in the exercise of its discretion, allow a claimant to file a winding-up petition against a solvent company. In our more detailed examination of the law in these grounds of decision, we have gone further to find that BNP\u2019s statutory demand for payment and its subsequent resistance to JSPL\u2019s application herein was unjustified and that any filing of a petition to wind up JSPL would have been an abuse of the winding-up process. In view of the foregoing, we dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of

class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"/>1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is an appeal against the decision of a High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) affirming the decision of a liquidator to reject a proof of debt lodged against a company in members\u2019 voluntary liquidation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"/>2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appellant is Fustar Chemicals Ltd (Hong Kong) (\u201cFCL\u201d), the plaintiff below. The respondent is Ms\u00a0Ong Soo Hwa (\u201cOSH\u201d), the liquidator of Fustar Chemicals Pte Ltd (the \u201cCompany\u201d). FCL filed a proof of debt on 18\u00a0November 2005 for $614,560.71 but this proof was rejected by OSH on 3\u00a0July 2007 on the basis of insufficient evidence. In Originating Summons No\u00a01088 of 2007 filed on 23\u00a0July 2007, FCL applied pursuant to r\u00a093 of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap\u00a050, R\u00a01, 2006\u00a0Rev Ed) to reverse the decision of OSH not to admit the proof of debt submitted by FCL and for FCL\u2019s proof of debt to be admitted in full. We now set out the pertinent facts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"/>3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company was incorporated in Singapore on 30\u00a0July 1987 with an issued and paid up-capital of 5,000 ordinary shares of $1 each. From financial year (\u201cFY\u201d) 1997 to FY\u00a01999, Wong Ser Wan (\u201cWSW\u201d) was the sole shareholder of the Company. From FY\u00a02000 to FY\u00a02004, WSW held 4,998 shares; WSW\u2019s ex-husband Ng Cheong Ling (\u201cNCL\u201d) held one share; and their daughter, Ng Eharn (\u201cNE\u201d), also held one share. It bears mention that there is no evidence on record (nor has it been suggested otherwise in submissions) that either WSW or NE made any payments for their shares. At the point of winding up, the Company\u2019s only directors were NE and WSW. They passed a special resolution for the Company to be placed under Members\u2019 voluntary liquidation on 24\u00a0July 2004 as a solvent company. OSH was appointed the liquidator by WSW and NE at the same extraordinary general meeting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"/>4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FCL was incorporated in Hong Kong and was in the business of selling (mainly) paraffin wax obtained from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d). Its shareholders were another Hong Kong company, Dynamic Pacific Ltd (9,999 shares out of a total of 10,000) and NCL\u2019s brother, Ng Cheong Bian (one share). FCL was part of a group of companies with trade links to China that were controlled by the Ng family. It was represented in Singapore by NCL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"/>5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company\u2019s primary business was that of an intermediary between FCL in Hong Kong and customers in Taiwan and South Africa. During that period, China had banned the sale of paraffin wax to Taiwan and South Africa. Goodwood Ltd, a company belonging to the same group of companies controlled by the Ng family, would buy paraffin wax from Chinese companies and sell them to Goodray Ltd, another Ng family controlled company. Goodray Ltd would in turn sell the paraffin wax to FCL which then resold them to the Company. FCL was the point of contact with customers in Taiwan and South Africa, but the actual sale and collection of revenue was made through the Company. In other words, the Company was mainly responsible for collecting debts that were in reality owed to FCL. It can be said that it discharged the role of a facilitator rather than that of a real trading company. There has been no suggestion by OSH that any of these arrangements offended the laws of Singapore. It is also not disputed that NCL was both the directing and controlling mind behind both FCL and the Company during the relevant trading period. WSW was, at all times, a homemaker and had neither any interest nor involvement in the business. According to NCL, the Company\u2019s business activities stopped in 1997 when the relationship between NCL and WSW became intractable. This has not been disputed by either WSW or OSH.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"/>6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCL and WSW were married in 1976 but the marriage began to sour in 1993. WSW eventually filed a divorce petition in October 1996. The divorce proceedings were both protracted and acrimonious and resulted in several different lawsuits between NCL and WSW as well as the companies controlled by them. A <em>decree nisi</em> was finally granted in 2000. A detailed history of their legal skirmishes can be found in the case report of the ancillary proceedings in <em>Wong Ser Wan v Ng Cheong Ling</em> <nobr>[2006] 1 SLR 416</nobr>. We note that the Judge attached some significance to the finding in those proceedings that NCL had attempted to dissipate his assets to reduce the pool of matrimonial assets available for division. In <em>Wong Ser Wan v Ng Bok Eng Holdings Pte Ltd</em> <nobr>[2004] 4 SLR 365</nobr> (\u201c<em>Ng Bok Eng Holdings</em>\u201d), Judith Prakash\u00a0J allowed WSW\u2019s claim that a series of property transfers by NCL to other related companies were in fact fraudulent conveyances. In due course, in 2002, NCL was made a bankrupt for failing to satisfy the judgment in another case involving Aromate Ltd, a company in which WSW was a shareholder and NCL a director. He currently remains an undischarged bankrupt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"/>7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The directors of the Company, WSW and NE, filed a Declaration of Solvency on 7\u00a0July 2004 (\u201cthe Declaration of Solvency\u201d)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a id=\"Ftn_1_1\" href=\"#Ftn_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> affirming that its assets exceeded its liabilities. The Declaration of Solvency further stated it was a true and correct statement of the company\u2019s assets and liabilities as at 31\u00a0March 2004. It listed under the Liabilities column \u201ctrade accounts\u201d a sum of $691,088 owing to unsecured creditors. The individual identities of these unsecured creditors were however not disclosed. WSW and NE eventually passed a special resolution on 26\u00a0July 2004 to wind up the company. We pause here to make, what is in our view, a crucial observation. While FCL is the major creditor of the Company, WSW is on the flip side its major debtor. The Declaration of Solvency records the amount due from one of the Company\u2019s director as $857,222. Counsel for OSH clarified at the hearing of this appeal in response to a query from us that this debt was actually due from WSW. It is not clear from the documents filed when and how WSW withdrew this amount from the Company. However, as the amount is not in dispute, we need say no more. What is material for the purposes of these proceedings is to point out that the amount due from WSW to the Company substantially exceeds the claim of FCL. It also bears mention that there is no evidence before us that this debt has been paid by WSW or collected by OSH. <em>This state of affairs could give rise to the perception that OSH regarded her principal role as liquidator was to search for reasons to reject the proof of debt filed by FCL</em>. We now turn to examine the basis for FCL\u2019s proof of debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The proof of debt</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"/>8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FCL submitted a proof of debt (\u201cFCL\u2019s debt\u201d) in December 2005 for the sum of HKD2,832,891.04 (equivalent to $614,560.71) which it claimed was a debt incurred by the Company since 1988 for goods supplied. FCL was then invited by OSH to provide supporting evidence in the form of invoices, purchase orders, delivery orders, shipping documents and other relevant documents. However, all FCL could submit as proof of its claim were the following supporting documents: (a)\u00a0copies of audit confirmations from the Company for FY\u00a01997 to FY\u00a02001; (b)\u00a0copies of FCL\u2019s own audited accounts for FY\u00a02000; and (c)\u00a0copies of ledger entries of the Company for FY\u00a01995 to FY\u00a01999. The audit confirmations signed by WSW acknowledged that in FY\u00a01997, the Company owed FCL a sum of $2,615,269.56. This sum was reduced by $582,537.21 in FY\u00a01998. Finally, in FY\u00a01999, an audit confirmation also signed by WSW recorded the sum of $614,560.71 (<em>ie</em>, the sum of FCL\u2019s debt). Each of these figures was matched by ledger entries made during the relevant accounting period. FCL\u2019s own audited accounts for FY\u00a02000 recorded that the Company owed FCL a debt of HKD2,832,891 (equivalent to FCL\u2019s debt). FCL claimed that the primary documents were no longer available. Under Hong Kong law, it was only obliged to keep the documents and records for seven years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"/>9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other than these materials, OSH also had the benefit of evaluating the Company\u2019s audited financial statements from FY\u00a01997 to FY\u00a02003. These audited financial statements recorded the total debt the Company owed without detailing the individual trade creditors. The FY\u00a01997 audited financial statement recorded the Company\u2019s debt to trade creditors as $2,663,520. By FY\u00a01998 this figure had been reduced to $634,389. In FY\u00a01999, the Company\u2019s debt to trade creditors increased marginally to $691,088. This amount remained constant in the audited financial statements of FY\u00a02000 to FY\u00a02003. The auditors for the Company were originally Chan &amp; Chan Certified Public Accounts (\u201cC&amp;C\u201d) for FY\u00a01997 to FY\u00a01998. After WSW commenced divorce proceedings, Goh Boon Kok &amp; Co (\u201cGBK\u201d) were appointed as auditors of the Company by her. They took over the auditing of the Company\u2019s accounts from FY\u00a01999 onwards. A qualification was subsequently inserted in all of the following years\u2019 audited financial statements to the effect that GBK had not received independent confirmation of the trade balance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"/>10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OSH rejected FCL\u2019s proof of debt on 3\u00a0July 2007. The following reasons were given:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"/>(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FCL was a related company and OSH considered it necessary to look behind the acknowledgment of debt between the parties;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"/>(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Company\u2019s auditors, GBK, qualified the accounts from FY 1999 to FY 2003 because it could not obtain independent confirmation of trade creditors, directors, shareholders and related party balances;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"/>(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FCL\u2019s own audited financial statements contained a disclaimer that the auditors could not form an opinion on the accounts for that year, and a provision for doubtful debt for the amount had been made since at least 31\u00a0December 1999;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"/>(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other than the ledger entries, there were no primary supporting documents for FCL\u2019s claim;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_e\"/>(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0no reason was given by FCL as to why the debt was allowed to remain outstanding for such a long period; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_f\"/>(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the interviews with NCL, WSW and another unrelated ex-director of the company, Mr\u00a0Ng Chan Ho, were inconclusive as they were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation of the primary transactions underlying the trade debts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The decision below</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"/>11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only issue before the High Court was whether, on a balance of probabilities, FCL\u2019s debt was a valid or invalid debt. Opinions of expert witnesses were extensively canvassed by both parties. Timothy Reid, for FCL, unsurprisingly opined that he would have accepted the existing documentary evidence as proof of debt in the absence of contradictory evidence. Timothy Reid views were not tested by cross-examination. On the other hand, Tam Chee Chong (\u201cTam\u201d), the expert witness for OSH, who had earlier assisted her in evaluating the validity of the proof of debt, took the view that the Company\u2019s accounts called for an explanation which was not forthcoming; therefore OSH was justified in her rejection of the proof of debt. Tam had earlier interviewed the auditors C&amp;C and GBK. He ascertained that both C&amp;C and GBK relied on NCL for information and documents on audit matters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"/>12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Judge agreed with OSH\u2019s decision and rejected FCL\u2019s application to admit the debt in full. In her view, the actual liabilities between the Company and FCL could not be accurately or completely ascertained because of the lack of primary accounting documents. The absence of these documents, she pointed out, had materially affected the decision of the second auditor GBK to insert the qualification in the audited financial statements that he was unable to obtain independent confirmation of the Company\u2019s trade balance. Any reasonable person in the position of OSH, put on notice by the qualification, would carry out other checks and enquiries to substantiate the balance (see <em>Fustar Chemicals Ltd v Liquidator of Fustar Chemicals Pte Ltd</em> <nobr>[2008] SGHC 198</nobr> (\u201cGD\u201d) at [40]). The Judge also noted that the only source of the auditors\u2019 information was NCL, and it would be \u201cimprudent\u201d (GD at [41]) to accept NCL\u2019s testimony at face value because of his past conduct \u2013 FCL and the Company were part of a web of companies that NCL used for his personal benefit. Lastly, the Judge appeared to have discounted Timothy Reid\u2019s opinion on the ground that it was contrary to the position in law. Why this was the case is not apparent from the grounds of decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">An overview of a liquidator\u2019s duty in assessing a proof of debt</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"/>13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The established principles of law are not disputed in the present case. In the winding up of a solvent company, the unsecured assets of the company will ordinarily be applied <em>pari passu</em> in satisfaction of its liabilities (subject to any preferential payments) and the surplus distributed among its members. The duty to pay the company\u2019s debts resides with the liquidator, who may exercise powers given to a liquidator in a winding up by the court as provided under s\u00a0305 Companies Act, Cap\u00a050 2006\u00a0Rev Ed. In a winding up, a creditor bears the burden of proving the debt on a balance of probabilities (see <em>Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell</em> <nobr>[1997] 142 FLR 137</nobr> and <em>The Trustee in Bankruptcy of Lo Siu Fai Louis v Toohey</em> <nobr>[2005] 4 HKC 51</nobr>). The liquidator must assess every proof of debt lodged and may call for further evidence in support of the claim. In considering a proof, the liquidator is not bound by the audited accounts or audit confirmations entered into by the company, and is entitled to go behind them to determine the veracity of the debt claimed (<em>In re Van Laun, ex p Pattulo</em> [1907] 1\u00a0KB 155 at 162; <em>Re Ice-Mack Pte Ltd; AA Valibhoy &amp; Sons (1907) Pte Ltd v Official Receiver</em> <nobr>[1989] SLR 876</nobr> (\u201c<em>Re Ice-Mack</em>\u201d)).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"/>14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These principles apply to the winding up of both solvent and insolvent companies. In <em>Re Menastar Finance Ltd (in liq.), Menastar Ltd v Simon</em> <nobr>[2003] 1 BCLC 338</nobr> (a case of an insolvent company), Etherton\u00a0J said the liquidator has a duty to \u201censure that the assets of the <em>insolvent</em> company \u2018are distributed amongst those who are justly, legally and properly creditors \u2026\u2019\u201d [emphasis added] at [46]. Only the <em>true</em> liabilities of a company should be met. This principle had been earlier clarified by the High Court of Australia in <em>Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O\u2019Brien</em> (1990) 169\u00a0CLR 332 at [184]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As the parties whose interests are affected by admission of a proof of debt are the general body of creditors and contributories rather than the company in liquidation, there are some liabilities which would be enforceable against the company but which a liquidator is not bound to admit to proof of debt lest the interests of creditors and the contributories may be unjustly affected. A liquidator may openly reject a proof of debt if the liability, though enforceable against the company, is not a true liability of the company but is found merely on some act or omission on the part of the company which unjustly prejudices the interests of the creditors or contributories in the assets available for distribution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"/>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>, a proof of debt was lodged against a company that had been compulsorily wound up. The creditor and the debtor company were \u2018associated\u2019 in that one person, Mr\u00a0Valibhoy, controlled both. Although the creditor\u2019s own audited financial statements were provided, pertinently, the statements did not attest to any debt owed by the company at all. All that was shown was that Mr\u00a0Valibhoy himself owed a debt to the creditor. Mr\u00a0Valibhoy tried to explain that, in reality, he had agreed to bear the debt that was originally incurred by the company personally so that the creditor would not be put to loss as a result of the company\u2019s winding up. This reason was rejected by the court because Mr\u00a0Valibhoy\u2019s debt to the creditor was incurred before the company was wound up. Further, the company\u2019s own audited accounts did not lend any support to the existence of the alleged debt. Instead, the only documentary evidence in support of the proof of debt was a solitary audit confirmation by the debtor company signed by Mr\u00a0Valibhoy himself, the same person controlling both debtor and creditor. Unsurprisingly, in light of the conflicting accounts stated and the close relationship between the parties, the audit confirmation was rejected by the High Court as sufficient evidence of the debt. Yong Pung How\u00a0J, as he then was, observed at [11]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In anything resembling an arms-length situation, an audit confirmation would of course be strong evidence against a party of the correctness of the credit or debit balance which it has confirmed. This particular confirmation was signed on behalf of the company, however, by Mr\u00a0Valibhoy and, in all the circumstances, unless it was corroborated by other more independent evidence, could not be accepted as evidence of the debt which it purported to confirm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It appeared to the court that Mr\u00a0Valibhoy was attempting to secure a claim at the expense of other legitimate creditors. Given the absence of any primary supporting documents, the presence of worrying discrepancies in the creditors\u2019 own audited accounts and Mr\u00a0Valibhoy\u2019s own contradictory explanations, the court unhesitatingly rejected the proof of debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"/>16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In <em>Re Adam Holdings Ltd</em> <nobr>[1985] 2 HKC 608</nobr> (\u201c<em>Re Adam Holdings</em>\u201d), a creditor which was the subsidiary of a company that was also compulsorily wound up submitted a proof of debt to the Official Receiver. The proof was supported by ledger entries of the group of companies as well as a draft account sent to the creditor by the debtor company, prepared by accountants, to confirm the balance due. No audited statements were produced, and the primary supporting documents were lost. Jones\u00a0J found that the ledger entries were riddled with discrepancies. Records of payments made to the debtor company were also produced as evidence of the debt. However, these records of payments received by the debtor company did not reflect a debt to the applicant creditor. Instead, they painted a completely different picture; the records of payment showed that the wound up company owed debts to other parties. In the result, the proof of debt was rejected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"/>17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, in <em>Capital Realty Pte Ltd v Chip Thye Enterprises (Pte) Ltd</em> <nobr>[2000] 4 SLR 548</nobr> (\u201c<em>Capital Realty</em>\u201d), Chao Hick Tin\u00a0J held that an audit confirmation was <em>prima facie</em> evidence of debt. He distinguished <em>Re Ice-Mack</em> as being \u201cwholly inapplicable\u201d (at [30]) since there were no circumstances warranting suspicion on the signing of the audit confirmation despite the close friendship of the debtor and creditor. Unlike both <em>Re Adam Holdings Ltd</em> and <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>, there were no discrepancies in the record of debts in any of the audited accounts. This case can more properly be classified as an \u201carms-length transaction\u201d unlike the case of <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"/>18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, the Hong Kong High Court in <em>Grand Gain Investment Ltd v Cosimo Borrelli</em> <nobr>[2006] HKCU 872</nobr> (unreported) (\u201c<em>Grand Gain Investment</em>\u201d) distinguished <em>Re Adam Holdings</em> on the basis that the accounts in the latter case were audited. In <em>Grand Gain Investment</em>, a creditor filed proofs of debt against three companies accompanied by a copy of the audited accounts of the companies concerned. The creditor held shares, either directly or indirectly, in all three companies. One of the creditor\u2019s directors gave evidence to explain the accounts and any differences therein. Barma\u00a0J held at [18]\u2013[19] that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">While it is no doubt correct to say that the court is not bound to accept the accounts of a company at face value, it seems to me that, nonetheless, weight should be given to the fact that the accounts in question have been audited, a process which requires the auditor to satisfy himself that the accounts provide a true and fair view of the company\u2019s financial position. Where there is evidence to show that the accounts are, or may be, inaccurate, or to cast doubt on the way in which the auditor carried out his duties, this will be a factor to take into account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">However, it seems to me that there is no evidence before me on which I could conclude that the audited accounts which have been put forward may be (still less, are) inaccurate or incorrect. The position here is rather different in this respect from that in either <em>Re Adam Holdings</em> or <em>Louis Lo v Toohey</em>. In <em>Re Adam Holdings</em>, it is not clear whether the court was considering audited accounts of the company, or ledgers which had been written up by its auditors. Nonetheless, it is clear from Jones J\u2019s summary of the evidence in relation to the various advances relied on in that case (at pages 610G to 612A of the judgment) that such evidence indicated that the advances were not made by the applicants in that case, but by other companies or entities associated with it. In those circumstances, it is not surprising that Jones J did not think it right to rely on accounts which suggested that the loans had been made by the applicant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It seems to us that the overriding concern of the courts in all the above cases was to ensure that that legitimate creditors and contributories of a company should not be prejudiced by spurious claims made by related parties under the guise of being creditors. What is spurious would depend on the facts of each case. The principle that can also be gleaned from this brief overview is that the duty of the liquidator in assessing a proof of debt is to ensure that while genuine debts are admitted and false claims are rejected, he must act <em>fairly</em> in discharging his duties. He must, at all times, be independent and hold an even hand in dealing with the often competing interests of creditors, contributories and his appointers. <em>A liquidator must never favour the interests of his appointers over that of the other legitimate claimants to the company\u2019s assets</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Our decision</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"/>19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The main issue in this appeal simply boils down to this: whether the liquidator ought to have accepted the proof of debt as supported by the various documents tendered without more. In this case, we have a running account that the Company\u2019s directors and shareholders had unequivocally accepted as correct between 1988 and 2000 (see <a href=\"#p1_8\">[8]</a> above). It is, in these circumstances, that the question of whether FCL\u2019s proof of debt is genuine or false should be approached by the liquidator and taking into account the reasons why FCL was not able to produce the supporting primary documents that OSH required.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The extent of a liquidator\u2019s duty in relation to the verification of a proof of debt</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"/>20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The verification of a proof of debt is not a mere administrative function. Only debts that are legally due are admissible. The liquidator has to ensure that the assets of the company are only distributed to creditors who have debts that have been genuinely created and remain legally due. He has extensive powers to go behind documents. Even judgments and compromise agreements can be re-evaluated to ensure that the debts are genuine. That said, a liquidator must have a reasonable basis on which to query a debt that appears to be genuine. Although a liquidator \u201cis not bound to admit\u201d any proof of debt which, if admitted, would affect the interests of creditors and contributories, he <em>is</em> only bound to take extraordinary steps to scrutinise a proof of debt on the basis that it could be a false claim in cases where he has reason to be suspicious about its genuineness or legal validity. Factors to be considered include, <em>inter alia</em>, the origins of the debt, the length of time the debt has been due, how the company has treated the debt in its financial statements, the business of the debtor company and, where relevant, the relationships between the claimants and the controlling shareholders of the company. In assessing these factors, the liquidator must rely on: (a)\u00a0knowledge of the general principles of company accounting; (b)\u00a0the auditing practice of companies by independent auditors; (c)\u00a0the effect and implication of directors\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 approvals annually of company accounts made in compliance with the law; (d)\u00a0the customary insolvency practice in verifying debts; and (e)\u00a0some degree of common sense in understanding human relationships. In taking into account these matters, he should also apprise himself of the nature of the business of the company, and other facts peculiar to the company in liquidation. In the case of the present company, the relationship between the directors and the shareholders, <em>inter se</em>, is obviously a relevant factor to be considered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"/>21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, although a liquidator has a duty to scrutinise all proofs of debt, the level of scrutiny required by the liquidator to discharge this duty must, in the final analysis, depend on the circumstances of the case. In the present case, OSH rejected FCL\u2019s proof only because it could not produce the related primary documents, even though FCL had explained that they had been destroyed or lost due to effluxion of time. This was not an unbelievable reason since the claimed debt was originally acknowledged by the Company as far back as January 1995, more than 9 years before the Company was wound up. OSH was aware that under Hong Kong law, FCL was not obliged to preserve indefinitely the related documents concerning a debt due to the Company (which is, in any case, from a related company or at least part of a group of companies controlled by NCL and his family). OSH was also aware that FCL\u2019s proof of debt was a debt that the Company itself had consistently acknowledged as owing in its own annual accounts, which had been approved by the WSW <em>qua</em> director and shareholder. In our view, although a liquidator has the power to look behind the audited financial statements and audit confirmations, a creditor\u2019s proof of debt should not be lightly rejected if the debt has been consistently acknowledged in audited accounts and or through audit confirmation statements. Such acknowledgments amount to an admission of the debt. Furthermore, a long effluxion of time inevitably creates evidential difficulties, as in the present case. Witnesses may be difficult to locate or may not be able to recollect essential details, and some may even become uncooperative. The relevant primary documents can also be destroyed or lost through the passage of time. In essence, while we accept that the burden of proof ordinarily rests on the creditor to substantiate a proof of debt this does not mean that the only means by which a creditor can prove a proof of debt must be through the production of primary documents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>A liquidator must not only act independently but be seen to do so</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"/>22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All liquidators have to uncompromisingly observe their obligations to maintain independence and act fairly regardless of the manner of their appointment and the identity of their appointer. For instance, in a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator must act independently, and not be open to influence from the appointing directors, especially when any of them has a vested interest in <em>denying</em> creditors their proofs of debt. In our opinion, OSH actions herein could be perceived as a failure to maintain independence and to act fairly. Here, WSW had previously taken out most of the surplus assets (see above at <a href=\"#p1_7\">[7]</a>). She now owes at least $857,222 to the Company. OSH has taken no steps to either collect this amount or to satisfactorily secure it. It is plain that if FCL\u2019s proof of debt were to be accepted, OSH would then have no alternative but to take steps to recover this substantial debt due to the Company from her true appointer. On the other hand, if OSH\u2019s decision were allowed to stand, the only person to benefit from it would be WSW.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"/>23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, having regard to the factors we have identified, the context in which FCL\u2019s proof of debt (in respect of a longstanding and consistently acknowledged debt) was rejected gives rise to real concerns as to whether OSH had gone out of her way to reject it on the mere basis that the primary documents relating to the debt could not be produced, and simply because the law conferred on her the power to do so. Given the original spousal relationship between WSW and NCL, and how the Company came to be involved in the trading outside Singapore, we find it difficult, if not impossible, to believe that WSW (as a director and a shareholder) did not know or accept that FCL\u2019s debt had been properly incurred, as confirmed by the approved annual accounts over many years. In rejecting FCL\u2019s debts, OSH did not appear to have directed her mind to all these relevant factors that we have mentioned earlier (above at <a href=\"#p1_20\">[20]</a>). <em>Her failure to do so has created real doubts in our mind about her independence of action</em>. Instead, she appears to have made strenuous efforts to reject the proof of debt, such as by her misplaced reliance on FCL\u2019s directors having characterised in their books the claim against the Company as a doubtful debt (see 10(c) above). It must have been obvious to anyone with an accounting background that doubtfulness about the collectability of a debt by a creditor has no effect on a legal obligation to make payment by the debtor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>OSH acted in excess of her duties</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"/>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The primary reasons for holding an inquiry have been amply set out in the Judge\u2019s decision below, as well as the findings of Tam and OSH herself. Substantially, the Judge below as well as the liquidator, OSH, thought that the transactions between FCL and the Company were not at arms length because one person, NCL, was the controlling mind of both FCL and the Company at the same time. This was exemplified by the prevalence of related party balances on the balance sheets of the companies (see GD at [41]). This, the Judge agreed, was especially troubling because the Company\u2019s auditors for the financial statements for FY\u00a01999 to FY\u00a02003 (after divorce proceedings had been initiated), GBK, added a qualification that it could not obtain independent confirmation of the trade balance. On the other hand, C&amp;C, the auditors for FY\u00a01997 and FY\u00a01998, did not similarly qualify the financial statements though they did say that they relied entirely on NCL for information regarding the Company. <em>Grand Gain Investment</em> did not apply in this case because of these difficulties faced by the auditors. There was no reason to take NCL\u2019s word for the existence of the debt since NCL had previously tried to dissipate his assets to related companies in an attempt to hide them from WSW during their divorce proceedings (see <em>Ng Bok Eng Holdings</em>), and had used the companies \u201clike an ATM network to withdraw funds as and when required\u201d (GD at [42]). Because the transactions were considered as not being at arms length, the proof of debt should be rejected, as was the case in <em>Re Adam Holdings</em> and <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"/>25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, despite the debt being on the books for a long time, NCL did not attempt to recover the debt at all. The primary supporting documents were destroyed even though NCL knew there could be difficulties in establishing his proof of debt, should the need arise. NCL\u2019s assertion that the supporting documents were sent to the law firm Allen &amp; Gledhill in relation to his divorce proceedings with WSW remained unproved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"/>26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, we are not persuaded that this approach is correct. Instead, we are inclined to agree with the appellant that the liquidator had wrongly exercised her discretion in rigorously insisting on proof of the debt exclusively through primary documents and had in fact acted in excess of her duties in the circumstances. These are our reasons for so doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"/>27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First and foremost, prior to the winding up, the Company consistently acknowledged the debt through audit confirmations and reflected this debt throughout the years in its audited financial statements continuously. It is also pertinent that WSW, <em>qua</em> director and shareholder, had herself confirmed the accuracy of the company\u2019s accounts repeatedly when she approved the same at director\u2019s and shareholders\u2019 meetings. Audit confirmations that the sum of $614,560.71 was due from the company to the appellant were signed by WSW in 1999, 2000 and 2001.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"/>28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OSH argued that although WSW signed off on the Company\u2019s accounts, these accounts were based on the information provided by NCL. However, there is no evidence of any wrongdoing on NCL\u2019s part in the preparation of these accounts. None of the alleged circumstances grounding the liquidator\u2019s decision to reject the proof of debt actually suggested that the debt was fictional. The most that could be said was that the financial statements, ledger entries and audit confirmations relied upon by FCL were not as credible as actual primary supporting documents. But this does not mean that they were of no evidential value. The Company\u2019s audited financial statements were unqualified during the material period from 1988 to 1998. Only after WSW\u2019s matrimonial difficulties with NCL became intractable and WSW and her daughter NE appointed GBK, were the accounts qualified (see <a href=\"#p1_9\">[9]</a> above). The accounts were in fact complete and did not appear to, <em>prima facie</em>, contain errors or omissions. The figures recorded in the Company\u2019s audited financial statements, the audit confirmations, the ledger entries and FCL\u2019s audited financial statements all corroborated each other. Even if NCL was the source from which the auditors gleaned their information, this was consistent with the fact that NCL was the controlling mind of the Company. Who else but NCL would have extensive information about the Company at his finger tips? The fact that the auditors relied on NCL for information does not in itself suggest that the accounts stated were wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"/>29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, this situation is quite unlike that in either <em>Re Adam Holdings Ltd</em> or <em>Re Ice-Mack</em> in that there were no discrepancies between the accounts stated and other documents. In contrast to <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>, there was not just one audit confirmation signed shortly before the debtor was wound up (that in fact conflicted with the debtor\u2019s own audited accounts), but rather a long history of audit confirmations that consistently stated the sum of money owed to FCL. However, although the primary supporting documents were destroyed, they were destroyed because, as explained by the appellant, they were no longer required to be kept under the law. No doubt in certain circumstances the destruction of documents might point to an attempt to conceal evidence, but in this case FCL should not be expected to keep documents longer than necessary under the law to establish its claim especially when, prior to the winding up, there was no challenge to the debt. Only through the unforgiving lens of hindsight could it be said that these documents ought to have been kept because of the liquidator\u2019s demand for further evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"/>30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, the Judge failed to take into consideration the fact that the Company was only an entity to park the trading receipts of FCL, and only whatever was left unclaimed by FCL represented the payment to the Company for its services. As noted in <em>Capital Realty</em>, a transaction will not be at arms length when the circumstances were such as to warrant suspicion of improprieties having been perpetrated, and not merely because the parties were related. Here, the Company was quite plainly a conduit for the receipts from goods sold by FCL to customers in South Africa and Taiwan; the Company\u2019s task essentially was to collect payment from these customers to <em>pay for goods received by these customers from FCL</em>. FCL\u2019s assertion that it was the Company\u2019s main trade creditor was thus not at all surprising, given that FCL (and its related entities) was, by virtue of the Company\u2019s business model, the Company\u2019s primary supplier of goods. There was no suggestion that the trade dealings between the Company and FCL were concocted from the outset. There was also no question of any of the dealings of the company with FCL being at arm\u2019s length. The reality was that the claim was based on entries which the Company and WSW as a director and shareholder had accepted and content to accept as genuine between the Company and FCL. These entries were not fictitious as they were represented by actual cash or receivables in the company\u2019s accounts. FCL\u2019s debt was a genuine debt <em>vis-\u00e0-vis</em> the company. In contrast, the alleged debt in <em>Re Ice-Mack</em> did not arise from the company\u2019s ordinary course of business. Essentially, the circumstances surrounding the incidence of the debt in that case were shrouded in mystery. Coupled with the discrepancies in the accounts stated, there were many reasons for the court in <em>Re Ice-Mack</em> to doubt the existence of the alleged loans. That is not the case here. Even if NCL was the controlling mind behind both FCL and the Company, it was never disputed in this appeal that the two related companies had an established creditor-debtor relationship well before the marriage between WSW and NCL broke down. Before OSH initiated her train of inquiry she ought to have simply asked herself this obvious question: <em>How else could the Company\u2019s assets been accumulated other than through the dealings it had with FCL at the behest of NCL?</em> The Company had no other source of revenue other than through its dealings with FCL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"/>31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although a liquidator has a duty to scrutinise all proofs of debt, there are certain debts which speak for themselves. These are debts which are included as part of the audited accounts of the company and approved by the directors and shareholders at annual shareholders' meetings. Such acknowledged debts <em>prima facie</em> bind the shareholders although they may not bind creditors of the company. In such cases, the liquidator has no duty to expend or waste company's funds to scrutinise such debts unless he has reason to suspect that they were entered in the books to defraud creditors. This is not the case here. There is really nothing to suggest that the debt was fictional. On the contrary, the documents provided consistently recorded the existence of the Company\u2019s debt to FCL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"/>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reiterate that although OSH had the legal right to inquire beyond the accounts in examining proofs of debt, this was not a case which called for such an inquiry. The Company itself had acknowledged that it was solvent and that it owed the debts claimed by FCL. The liquidation was voluntary. It is irrelevant for the purposes of these proceedings that NCL may have taken steps in other unrelated matters to conceal his assets (see <a href=\"#p1_6\">[6]</a> above). Indeed, the relationship between the company and FCL began long before the marriage between WSW and NCL floundered. It is also not insignificant that the ultimate balance due to FCL, in the running account reflected in the Company\u2019s books, had been very substantially reduced when the business relationship stopped (see <a href=\"#p1_8\">[8]</a> above). The accounts were historically complete and there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of NCL in finalising the accounts at the material times. WSW herself had consistently acknowledged the existence of the debt to the appellant by, <em>inter alia</em>, signing the audit confirmations. She cannot approbate and reprobate and now employ the liquidation proceedings as another legal forum to continue wrangling with NCL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"/>33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It appears that OSH decided to do what she did <em>not</em> because she was an exceptionally conscientious liquidator. On the contrary, the facts suggest that she was in a position of conflict of interest, because what she set out to do was not reasonable and could only benefit her appointer, WSW, and no one else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"/>34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the day, it is plain to us that there was no valid reason to reject FCL\u2019s proof of debt. In the result, we allow the appeal and direct OSH to accept FCL\u2019s proof of debt, inclusive of interest at the rate of 3% per annum which is to be calculated on the basis it commences 3 months after the date the proof of debt was lodged with the Company. The appellant will be entitled to costs here and below, with the usual consequential orders. In light of our findings above, it is our view that all of OSH\u2019s costs and disbursements in relation and incidental to FCL\u2019s proof of debt were not properly incurred. Therefore, she is entitled to be paid her costs and disbursements from the assets of the Company only after all the Company\u2019s creditors have been paid.</p>\n\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><sup><a id=\"Ftn_1\" href=\"#Ftn_1_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Appellant\u2019s Core Bundle Vol\u00a0II Part B at p\u00a0276</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\7\\7\\URJ_[2001]_SGCA_27_v1.0.html\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"4219\" id=\"4219-M\" uniqueid=\"9917b3e7-b16f-44c9-8847-6cb74210b8dc\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/4219-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2003-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2001-04-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2001</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>27</No>\n      <NCit>[2001] SGCA 27</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>27</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2001] SGCA 27</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>Tan Kok Lam (next friend to Teng Eng) v Hong Choon Peng</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Tan Kok Lam (next friend to Teng Eng) v Hong Choon Peng</SortTitle><SortDate>2001-04-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA  83/2000</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#3\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Appellant</Role>\n        <Name>Tan Kok Lam (next friend to Teng Eng)</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#6\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Respondent</Role>\n        <Name>Hong Choon Peng</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#7\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third Party</Role>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#68\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Chao Hick Tin JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#539\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L P Thean JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#627\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Yong Pung How CJ</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Kang Kim Yang and Aileen Boey (Joseph Tan Jude Benny Anne Choo) for the appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Low Tiang Hock (Chor Pee &amp; Partners ) for the motorcyclist</Counsel>\n    </Counsels>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#1711\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Damages</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#1718\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Compensation and damages</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Whether \"pain and suffering\" and \"loss of amenities\" under separate heads of damages</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Whether unconsciousness prevented victim from claiming substantial damages for loss of amenities</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#3198\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Tort</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#3233\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Negligence</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"3\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#3237\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Damages</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Whether \"pain and suffering\" and \"loss of amenities\" under separate heads of damages</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n  \n\n<SLR>YES</SLR></Metadata>\n</CaseReport>\n<body>\n    <p>(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): On 24 September 1996, Teng Eng (`Teng`), whom the appellant, Tan Kok Lam (`Tan`) is next friend to, was knocked down by a motorcycle driven by the respondent, Hong Choon Peng (`Hong`). Teng was then 67 years of age. A CT brain scan showed a `left frontal brain contusion with fronto-tempero-parietal acute subdural haematoma`. A craniectomy and evacuation of the acute subdural haematoma were undertaken at the Singapore General Hospital.<br/><br/>The evidence showed that Teng was not able to respond to visual and verbal stimulation. She could respond to pain, but was not aware of it. Her life expectancy was reduced and while she might live beyond five years she will not  live up to 10 years. The assistant registrar found Teng to be in a `persistent vegetative state`.<br/><br/>Interlocutory judgment was entered in the High Court against Hong for 50% of the damages to be assessed. An assessment was duly carried out by the assistant registrar who awarded Tan, among others, $80,000 for the loss of amenities. The assistant registrar felt that the fact that Teng was and is in a persistent vegetative state did not preclude her from making a substantial award for loss of amenities, as opposed to an award for pain and suffering.<br/><br/>Hong appealed against that award to the High Court and the trial judge, being of the view that unconsciousness should preclude the award of a substantial amount for loss of amenities, reduced the amount under this head to $21,000. He stated that:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I think loss of amenities as a head of damages means loss of the capacity to enjoy the amenities of life. The injured person has been deprived of the means of enjoying life to the full that he would be able to but for the injury or deprivation. With respect, I agree with Lord Devlin in <strong> H West &amp; Son Ltd &amp; Anor v Shephard</strong> that in assessing damages under this head both the objective and the subjective elements must be considered and that deprivation should be measured mainly by the sense of loss. Where as in this case the injured person is unaware of the loss and is spared the frustration, distress and suffering resulting from an awareness of the loss damages should only be moderate and conventional.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Having heard the appeal on 19 February 2001, we disagreed with the approach taken by the trial judge and restored the award of $80,000 granted by the assistant registrar. We now give our reasons.<br/><br/><strong><i> Issues on appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The present appeal raised primarily a question of law as to whether our courts should adopt the majority decisions in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Wise v Kaye</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1962] 1 QB 638</font> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>H West &amp; Son v Shephard</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1964]  AC 326</font>, where it was held that notwithstanding that the victim had remained unconscious as to his surroundings because he had, due to the accident, been reduced to a persistent vegetative state, he is still entitled to claim for substantial damages in relation to loss of amenities. In the alternative, Hong argued that even if West v Shephard were followed in Singapore, $80,000 was high or excessive. But, it was not seriously contended that it was so high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate necessitating the intervention of this court.<br/><br/><strong><i> The authorities </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We will begin examination of the question with the leading case, <strong><i> Wise v Kaye </i></strong>, where a young woman, aged 20, suffered serious brain injuries from a motor accident. She was hospitalised for 3[half ] years, helpless and unconscious. There was no prospect of recovery and she would never have any knowledge of her condition. Liability in that case was not in question. The trial judge awarded, inter alia, o15,000 as general damages. No claim was made for pain and suffering. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that general damages must be assessed on an objective basis and the fact that the victim was ignorant of the loss suffered was  irrelevant and therefore the award of general damages given by the first instance judge at o15,000 was not excessive. Sellers LJ, delivering the main judgment of the majority, said (at p 651):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Unless authority directs, I would be reluctant to apply a standard or basis which required that the happiness of a living person has to be assessed, as it would have to be assessed, to use the common expression, subjectively. I know of no authority which supports this view and have heard no evidence adduced which would in any case permit of its true solution. The head of claim for pain and suffering would come nearer to considerations of happiness - but not, I think, in any deep sense - than would a claim for loss of limbs or faculties.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Sellers LJ distinguished  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Benham v Gambling</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1941]  AC 157</font> on the basis that the latter case was concerned with an action on behalf of a dead child`s estate for the restricted claim for loss of years of life. Sellers LJ refused to treat an injured party as if the latter were dead and to award compensation only for loss of expectation of life and nothing else by way of general damages. He felt that while in common law pain and suffering and loss of amenities are invariably lumped together, they are distinct and separate heads of claim.<br/><br/>The second member of the quorum, Upjohn LJ also reiterated that damages suffered by a living plaintiff were assessed upon entirely different principles from those applicable to a claim for damages on behalf of a deceased person. In respect of a claim for a living person, the fact that she was ignorant of the grave loss was irrelevant because `the injury to her has been done; the damage has been suffered`. In this respect, loss of amenities should be distinguished from pain and suffering. He said (at p 660):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>If a plaintiff suffers personal injuries from the wrong-doing of another his cause of action accrues though he may be ignorant of the fact that he has been damaged: <strong> Cartledge v E Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd</strong>. It is difficult to see why, in general, damages for such injury should be affected by ignorance unless the ignorance prevents the head of damage arising as in the case of pain and suffering.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Upjohn LJ also relied upon an earlier Australian case  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>McGrath Trailer Equipment v Smith</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1956]  VLR 738</font> to come to the conclusion he did. In <strong><i> McGrath Trailer </i></strong>, the plaintiff became childlike because of severe brain injury. Herring CJ rejected the subjective test advanced by the defendant and stated (at p 741):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The matter has to be treated objectively - what has the plaintiff lost as a result of his injuries, how great is the diminution of his capacity to enjoy life? ... The measure of his loss is not affected by the fact that he does not now by reason of his injuries realise what he has lost and does not miss his inability to live a normal life. It matters not that he now seems content with the cabbage-like existence, that his injuries have forced upon him, although, in truth, we have no knowledge if this is so in fact.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The majority of the court in <strong><i> Wise v Kaye </i></strong> (supra) also thought it irrelevant the fact that the plaintiff would not be able to use the compensation awarded.<br/><br/>However, the third member of the court, Diplock LJ, felt that the extent to which a particular plaintiff was likely to be deprived of pleasure or happiness, which but for the disability he would have enjoyed, was a matter to be taken into account. In other words, unconsciousness by the plaintiff of his predicament was a factor which should adversely affect the quantum of damages to be awarded.<br/><br/>The next leading case is <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra), where the plaintiff, aged 41, was knocked down in a motor accident and sustained severe head injuries resulting in cerebral atrophy and paralysis of all four limbs. Her life expectancy was reduced to five years. She might, to some extent at least, have appreciated the condition which she was in. The trial judge, relying upon the award of o15,000 in <strong><i> Wise v Kaye </i></strong> (supra), awarded general damages at o17,500 as he felt the plaintiff here was worse off than the plaintiff in <strong><i> Wise v Kaye </i></strong> since the plaintiff here must have some knowledge of her own condition. The Court of Appeal, and the House of Lords (by a 3-2 majority), dismissed the appeal. The majority of the House endorsed the views taken by the majority in <strong><i> Wise v Kaye </i></strong>.<br/><br/>Four of the Law Lords (Reid, Tucker, Morris and Pearce) in <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> were of the view that the guidance enunciated in <strong><i> Benham v Gambling (supra) </i></strong> applied only to the assessment of damages for loss of expectation of life, and that it did not extend to any other class of cases. Three of the Law Lords (Tucker, Morris and Pearce) felt that unconsciousness did not eliminate the actuality of the deprivation of amenities of life. But all the members of the House thought that the court was not concerned to consider the use which would thereafter be made of the money awarded.<br/><br/>We shall now look at the approach taken by some of the Law Lords on the issue of unconsciousness vis-.-vis loss of amenities. We shall start with the minority judgment of Lord Reid, where he said (at p 341):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>If a man`s injuries make him wholly unconscious so that he suffers none of these daily frustrations or inconveniences, he ought to get less than the man who is every day acutely conscious of what he suffers and what he has lost. I do not say that he should get nothing. This is not a question that can be decided logically. I think that there are two elements, what he has lost and what he must feel about it, and of the two I think the latter is generally the more important to the injured man. To my mind there is something unreal in saying that a man who knows and feels nothing should get the same as a man who has to live with and put up with his disabilities, merely because they have sustained comparable physical injuries. It is no more possible to compensate an unconscious man than it is to compensate a dead man.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Lord Devlin, the other member of the minority, thought that the approach taken in <strong><i> Benham v Gambling </i></strong> (supra) was correct and that that approach was applicable even in a case, such as that in West v Shephard, where death did not intervene. While there are two elements in considering the question of loss of amenities in such a case, the objective and the subjective elements, he felt that as between the two, the objective element should be `very moderately assessed`. He said (at p 362):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>If it were not that the objective element has already by the authorities been given a place in the assessment, I should question whether it ought to be there at all. I think that deprivation should be measured mainly, if not wholly, by the sense of loss. I cannot help feeling that the contrary view is coloured by the thought that a wrongdoer should be made to pay damages commensurate with the gravity of the physical injury he has inflicted rather than with the suffering he has caused.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The views of the majority Law Lords were otherwise. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest put the question of the relevance of unconsciousness in these terms (at p 349):   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>An unconscious person will be spared pain and suffering and will not experience the mental anguish which may result from knowledge of what has in life been lost or from knowledge that life has been shortened. The fact of unconsciousness is therefore relevant in respect of and will eliminate those heads or elements of damage which can only exist by being felt or thought or experienced. The fact of unconsciousness does not, however, eliminate the actuality of the deprivations of the ordinary experiences and amenities of life which may be the inevitable result of some physical injury.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Lord Pearce emphasised that the ruling in <strong><i> Benham v Gambling (supra) </i></strong> should be viewed in its proper context when he said (at p 366):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>In <strong> Benham v Gambling</strong> this House was called on to answer a particular problem that had recently caused grave difficulty in the courts. It had little direct connection with the daily cases concerned with injuries that disable the living body. The problem simply stated was `Is life a boon`? And, if so, what is `the money value of all that which we lose by death?`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Lord Pearce then proceeded to reiterate that the traditional method of assessing injuries should continue:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The loss of happiness of the individual plaintiffs is not, in my opinion, a practicable or correct guide to reasonable compensation in cases of personal injury to a living plaintiff. A man of fortitude is not made less happy because he loses a limb. It may alter the scope of his activities and force him to see his happiness in other directions. The cripple by the fireside reading or talking with friends may achieve happiness as great as that which, but for the accident, he would have achieved playing golf in the fresh air of the links (p 368).</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I venture to think that an alteration of the current principles of assessing damages for personal injury would be an embarrassment to a practice which in spite of its difficulties does in the main produce a just result. Common law courts should not lightly abandon a method of estimation that works reasonably well and achieves a certain amount of precision, for a method that is nebulous, variable and subjective. I cannot read <strong> Benham v Gambling</strong> as having by implication intended such a result (p 369).</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>By contrast, in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Skelton v Collins</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1965] 105 CLR 94</font>, the Australian High Court, by a majority of 4-1, departed from the majority decision in <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra) and ruled in that case that, where the plaintiff`s expectation of life had been reduced and who had been rendered permanently unconscious by the injuries, in assessing damages, regard must be had to the fact that the plaintiff was insensible of his deprivation. It therefore held that, for loss of expectation of life and the loss of amenities of life, only moderate sums should be awarded. Kitto J said he was unable to agree with the majority in <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra) that the guidance enunciated in <strong><i> Benham v Gambling (supra) </i></strong> should only apply to cases involving death. He put it as follows (at p 102):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>(<strong> Benham v Gambling</strong>) treated of life not as a state of being a mere physical phenomenon, but as a thing to be lived and lived consciously. Thus, what was meant by every reference to loss of expectation of life was, in truth, loss of the possibility of conscious experience. The whole burden of the Lord Chancellor`s speech was the legal impropriety of attempting to place any but the most modest figure on a human being`s capacity to experience the varied quality of life; and I cannot bring myself to say that although the law sees the impropriety where a person has died it does not see it where he has lost all capacity for thought and feeling.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Kitto J, in reference to Lord Morris` remark that unconsciousness does not eliminate `the actuality of the deprivations` countered it with this argument (at p 103):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>What is here said of the fact of unconsciousness may equally be said of the fact of death; but in relation both to death and to unconsciousness surely it is true that what ought to affect the quantum of damages is not the actuality of the deprivations but their value: what would `the ordinary experiences and amenities of life` (in the future) have added up to, if the plaintiff had not been cut off from them?</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Kitto J was unable to distinguish a case where the person was physically dead as opposed to only dead to all experiences.<br/><br/>Another member of the quorum, Taylor J, was also of the same view and while recognising that the expression `loss of amenities of life` was a loose expression, said (at p 113):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... but as a head of damages in personal injury cases it is intended to denote a loss of the capacity of the injured person consciously to enjoy life to the full as, apart from his injury, he might have done.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>However, in the dissenting judgment of Menzies J, he basically agreed with the majority decision in <strong><i> Wise v Kaye </i></strong> (supra) and <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra). He said (at pp 124-125):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Loss of capacity - total or partial, permanent or temporary - to live the life that could otherwise have been lived is, apart from damages for pain and suffering, the fundamental loss for which general damages for personal injury are awarded. It is from this loss that other losses stem. Thus, for instance, loss of earnings arises from loss of capacity to work. Moreover, the fullness of a man`s life cannot be measured simply by the happiness which it brings to him; capacity to live fully includes capacity to suffer, to master adversity, to endure as well as to enjoy. Thus, unconsciousness is basic incapacity which ought not to be regarded as insignificant in itself and as depriving other injuries of their significance. Remarkable though it may be, a quadriplegic with a lively mind can live a life which seems worthwhile both to himself and to others, whereas a person whose incapacity includes loss of consciousness seems to me to have lost everything. If, therefore, damages are awarded as such compensation for injury as money can provide and part of the injury which a person suffers is brain injury, it seems to me odd that a disabled man who is conscious but not in pain should be awarded o15,000 while a man additionally injured can recover but o5,000 damages because he has been rendered permanently unconscious. The difference cannot, I think, be satisfactorily explained merely in terms of unhappiness from awareness of injury. From its very nature, however, unconsciousness does negative pain and suffering.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The next significant case that had come before the English courts where this point was again addressed was <strong><i> Lim Poh Choo v Camden </i></strong> &amp;  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Islington Area Health Authority</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1980]  AC 174</font>, where a senior psychiatric registrar with the National Health Service, aged 36, suffered severe brain damage following her admission to hospital for a minor operation. In the words of Lord Scarman, who delivered the sole judgment of the House, `she is now the wreck of a human being, suffering from extensive and irremediable brain damage, which has left her only intermittently, and then barely, sentient and totally dependent upon others.` The trial judge described her condition thus: `she is so intellectually impaired that she does not appreciate what has happened to her` - [1979] QB 196 at  201.  However, her life expectancy remained substantially unaffected. The trial judge awarded her a sum of o20,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities. This sum was upheld and the House reiterated the majority decision in <strong><i> West v Shephard (supra) </i></strong>. This was how Lord Scarman put it (at p 188):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I think it would be wrong now to reverse by judicial decision the two rules which were laid down by the majority of the House in <strong> H West &amp; Son Ltd v Shephard</strong>, namely: (1) that the fact of unconsciousness does not eliminate the actuality of the deprivation of the ordinary experiences and amenities of life (see the formulation used by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, at p 349); (2) that, if damages are awarded upon a correct basis, it is of no concern to the court to consider any question as to the use that will thereafter be made of the money awarded. The effect of the two cases (<strong> Wise v Kaye</strong> being specifically approved in <strong> H West &amp; Son Ltd v Shephard</strong>) is two-fold. First, they draw a clear distinction between damages for pain and suffering and damages for loss of amenities. The former depend upon the plaintiffs` personal awareness of pain, her capacity for suffering. But the latter are awarded for the fact of deprivation - a substantial loss, whether the plaintiff is aware of it or not. Secondly, they establish that the award in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Benham v Gambling</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1941]  AC 157</font> (assessment in fatal cases of damages for loss of expectation of life) is not to be compared with, and has no application to, damages to be awarded to a living plaintiff for loss of amenities.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Position in Singapore </i>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>As far as Singapore is concerned, it would appear that there has not been any case where the court had to consider the element of loss of amenities of life in its own right, distinct and separate from that of pain and suffering; and neither has the court had the occasion to examine the question of whether an unconscious plaintiff is entitled to claim for loss of amenities of life where, in view of his condition, he would not be able to experience pain or the loss. However, in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Au Yeong Wing Loong v Chew Hai Ban</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1993:3:355:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1993:3:355:\">  [1993] 3 SLR 355 </a>, KS Rajah JC did make this comment (at p 361):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Pain and suffering and loss of amenities are usually quantified together and a single award is usually made without indicating how much is awarded under each head, partly because it is difficult to separate them.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>While as a matter of practice the courts in Singapore have often lumped the claim for `pain and suffering` together with that for `loss of amenities` they are not the same and neither is one subsumed under the other. The example given by counsel for Hong is apt: suffering pain from a fracture of a leg is different from the consequential disability (if any), the latter giving rise to the loss of amenities. A fractured leg would not necessarily give rise to a loss of amenities other than for the short period the fracture required to heal: much would depend on whether there is any residual disability. One local case where the two claims were given separate awards was  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978)</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1984-1985::10:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1984-1985::10:\">  [1984-1985] SLR 10 </a><a href=\"MLJ:1984:1:325:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1984:1:325:\">  [1984] 1 MLJ 325 </a>. The Privy Council did not make any adverse comment that this was wrong.<br/><br/><strong><i> Our decision </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Like the learned judge below, counsel for Hong relied upon the dicta of Lord Devlin in West v Shephard (cited in [para ]16 above) to argue that as Teng, because of  her unconsciousness, could no longer appreciate any loss, the sum awarded should be moderate. Further, arguing from the fact that just as no damages are allowed for pain and suffering which is not felt, similarly no damages should be allowed for loss of amenities which is also not felt. The principle for awarding damages is to give the injured party reparation for the wrong done. Accordingly, the learned judge below preferred the minority view in <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra) and the majority view in <strong><i> Skelton v Collins (supra) </i></strong>.<br/><br/>However, on our part, we felt otherwise. In our view, the majority view of the court in <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra) is more in line with the ends of justice, which is to compensate the plaintiff for the injuries he has sustained, as well as pecuniary losses which he has suffered or is likely to suffer.<br/><br/>We recognise and accept that for a claim for pain and suffering, unconsciousness on the part of the victim would negative that claim and thus render an award in respect of that claim inappropriate. A claim for pain necessarily suggests that the victim has consciousness, otherwise there is no question of him enduring any pain for which he should be compensated. However, the same cannot be said for loss of amenities. Whether or not there is loss of amenities is an objective fact. It cannot and should not depend on an appreciation of the loss by the victim. Perhaps the point can be better illustrated by a simple example, where in an accident the victim not only loses a leg, he also loses his mental faculty. Are we to say that because the victim cannot appreciate his present condition, no substantive award should be made even for the loss of the leg? We should think not. Has he not lost the ability to move about freely, even with the help of an artificial limb? And if a substantive award should be made for the loss of the leg, why should it be otherwise for the complete loss of the mental faculty? While it might be thought that we are treading on dangerous ground to make comparisons between injuries, we think there is no greater injury or loss, as far as a living person is concerned, than to be turned into a cabbage.<br/><br/>It seems to us that the dissenting judgments in <strong><i> Wise v Kaye (supra) </i></strong> and <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra) were greatly affected by the approach taken by the House of Lords in <strong><i> Benham v Gambling (supra) </i></strong> where it was held that for loss of expectation of life, only a small sum should be given. In those dissenting judgments, the judges equated a person who is permanently unconscious with one who is dead, and thus that person has effectively lost no more than the expectation of life. It is clear that <strong><i> Benham v Gambling </i></strong> was decided in the way it was to arrest the trend then of juries making large awards for the loss of expectation of life as a separate head of damage: see (1954) 70 LQR 179. The decision in that case should not be extended by analogy to cases where there is no death.<br/><br/>In our view, what Lord Devlin referred to as feelings of frustration and anguish for the loss should appropriately be considered to fall under the head of pain and suffering. One can suffer on account of pain from a physical injury. But that is not the only way in which suffering could come about. Feelings of frustration and anguish are as much sufferings, although the cause or source of those feelings may be different from that of physical pain. There is no logic to confine suffering to only physical pain.<br/><br/>The authors of <strong><i> Winfield &amp; Jolowicz on Tort </i></strong> (14th Ed) state at p 607 that `pain and suffering includes the suffering attributable to the injury itself and to any consequential medical treatment, and worry about the effects of the injury upon the plaintiff`s way of life and prospects.`<br/><br/>In this regard, we think the caution uttered by Lord Pearson in <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra) is germane, namely, that it would `be lamentable if the trial of a personal injury claim puts a premium on protestations of misery and if a long face was the only safe passport to a large award.`<br/><br/><strong><i> Judgment </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In the result, we preferred the approach taken by the majority in <strong><i> Wise v Kaye </i></strong> (supra) and <strong><i> West v Shephard </i></strong> (supra) and held that notwithstanding unconsciousness, a person, who as a result of another`s negligence suffers from brain damage leading to unconsciousness, is entitled to substantial damages. Accordingly, we restored the quantum of damages awarded by the assistant registrar to Tan.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n

the court):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1-FirstPara\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 9\u00a0March 2004 we delivered a judgment (reported at <nobr>[2004] 2 SLR 300</nobr>) allowing an appeal by the appellants-defendants against a decision of the High Court granting damages to the respondent-plaintiff in an action in tort, on account of the fact that an engine supplied by the appellants for use on a vessel of the respondent was defective, thus resulting in the respondent suffering economic losses. We ruled that, in the circumstances of the case, the respondent was not entitled to claim in tort for the economic losses against the appellants.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was also a related appeal which was filed by the respondent who was dissatisfied with the quantum of damages awarded by the judge. In view of our ruling on the defendants\u2019 appeal, it followed that the respondent\u2019s appeal had to be dismissed. The full facts of the case were set out in our earlier judgment and we do not propose to repeat them here.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following our judgment, the appellants\u2019 solicitors wrote to inform this court that on the third day of the trial, 24\u00a0April 2002, the appellants made an offer in the prescribed form to pay the respondent the sum of US$1.5m in settlement of its claim. The offer, which was open for acceptance within 14 days, was not accepted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our judgment, we awarded costs to the appellants in respect of both the appeal as well as the trial below. What the appellants now seek is that, in view of the respondent\u2019s non-acceptance of their offer, they be awarded, pursuant to O\u00a022A r\u00a09 of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed), indemnity costs instead of just standard costs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The governing provision for our present purposes is O\u00a022A r\u00a09(3), and it reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where an offer to settle made by a defendant \u2014</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent made the following points to argue that the appellants should not be granted indemnity costs:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The offer was not serious and genuine, being substantially less than what the trial judge held to be the damages which the respondent was entitled to.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The offer was made very late, after the trial had commenced. The respondent failed in the claim because this court held that the appellants did not owe the respondent a duty of care, a point which was only raised at the start of the trial when leave to amend the defence was obtained. This court has a wide discretion in the matter and should consider all the circumstances before awarding indemnity costs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The issue of law in question was a highly controversial one and the court only came to its conclusion after much deliberation. It was a novel point.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Much of the time at trial was spent on establishing the fact that the engine supplied by the appellants was defective and the cause of it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quite clearly, the court is not obliged to award indemnity costs just because the offer made by one party is more favourable than what the opposing party eventually obtained from the court. This is explicitly spelt out in O\u00a022A r\u00a09(5) which reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Without prejudice to paragraphs (1), (2) and (3), where an offer to settle has been made, and notwithstanding anything in the offer to settle, the Court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent any costs are to be paid, and the Court may make such a determination upon the application of a party or of its own motion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">and in O\u00a022A r\u00a012 which reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Without prejudice to Rules\u00a09 and 10, the Court, in exercising its discretion with respect to costs, may take into account any offer to settle, the date the offer was made, the terms of the offer and the extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s judgment is more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>The Endurance\u00a01</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 661</nobr>, this court, recognising that O\u00a022A was of recent origin, took into account the approaches taken by some Commonwealth countries, where provisions similar to our O\u00a022A exist, <i>eg</i>, Canada and Australia, and held that, generally speaking, the element of compromise should be present in an offer to settle. It said at [43] that \u201cthe lack of compromise would be a material consideration in determining whether the plaintiff or the defendant should be penalised with higher costs in cases where there are genuine issues of liability raised\u201d. This is because the rationale behind O\u00a022A is to encourage the speedy termination of litigation by agreement of the parties. The offer to settle should therefore be a serious and genuine offer and not just to entail the payment of costs on an indemnity basis. It should contain in it an element which would induce or facilitate settlement: see <i>Singapore Airlines Ltd v Fujitsu Microelectronics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (No\u00a02)</i> <nobr>[2001] 1 SLR 532</nobr> (\u201c<i>SIA v Fujitsu</i>\u201d) at [10]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Even though the relevant [New South Wales] rules are not identical in wording with ours, we would respectfully agree with those views. In our opinion, for an offer to have the effect contemplated in O\u00a022A r\u00a09, it must contain in it an element which would induce or facilitate settlement. When such an element is missing, then, as held in <i>Data General</i> [see [63] <i>infra</i>], that would be a ground for the court to exercise its discretion to vary the norm relating to costs laid down in r\u00a09.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we would add one rider to this. Where there is no defence of any substance to a liquidated claim, then compromise is not a necessary element in an offer to settle: see <i>The Endurance\u00a01</i> at [43]. The reason for this was explained by Morden\u00a0ACJO in <i>Data General (Canada) Ltd v Molnar Systems Group Inc</i> (1991) 85\u00a0DLR\u00a0(4th) 392 (\u201c<i>Data General</i>\u201d) at 399 as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The purpose of the rule is to discourage a defendant from using the judicial process, at the increased cost to the plaintiff, to delay the granting of the inevitable judgment and, in my view, there is no valid policy reason why a plaintiff should have to forgo part of its claim in order to be able to avail itself of the benefit of the rule. In such a case, I do not think there is any unfair prejudice to the defendant in being faced with such an offer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What would constitute a serious and genuine offer to settle must depend on the circumstances and issues of the case. In <i>Data General</i>, the plaintiff offered to settle at 100% of the liquidated sum claimed. In view of the complexity of the case which gave rise to uncertainty as to liability, the Ontario Court of Appeal did not consider it appropriate to order costs against the defendant on an indemnity basis.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Tickell v Trifleska Pty Ltd</i> (1991) 25\u00a0NSWLR 353, the plaintiff made an offer to compromise for 100% of the amount claimed. There the court held that there was no element of compromise in the offer and refused to grant costs on an indemnity basis.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the other end of the spectrum, in <i>Burton v Global Benefit Plan Consultants Inc</i> (1999) 93\u00a0ACWS\u00a0(3d) 223; (1999) 556\u00a0APR 86, the fifth defendant offered to settle the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for $1 in full settlement, inclusive of costs. The plaintiffs, who eventually lost the action, did not accept the offer. The court held the offer to be a nominal one as it effectively asked the plaintiff to capitulate. Indemnity costs were refused to the fifth defendant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another interesting comparison is <i>SIA v Fujitsu</i>, where the issue was whether the defendant air carrier was entitled to enjoy the limitation of liability under the amended Warsaw Convention in respect of goods conveyed by the carrier. The plaintiff was the owner of the goods. The defendant offered to pay a sum based on the limitation of liability prescribed in the Convention. The defendant succeeded in the defence of limitation. However, this court refused to grant indemnity costs to the defendant because (at [11]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]he offer to settle \u2026 was not really an offer to settle as it did not in substance contain any incentive to settle. The crux of the dispute related to the difference between the actual value of the lost package and the sum laid down in the amended Convention as being payable to the respondents for the loss. On that real issue, there was no genuine or serious effort to seek a compromise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would be noted that one common feature in all these four cases discussed above is the fact that in each instance the offeror effectively expected the other party to capitulate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The offer in the present case was US$1.5m, though without mentioning costs. The trial judge who ruled in favour of the respondent quantified its loss at US$2,979,589. It could broadly be said that the sum offered was about half of the actual loss, even taking costs into account. Bearing in mind that the question of liability was complex and to an extent novel, the offer could not be said to be anything other than serious and genuine.\u00a0 It was a substantial offer with a view to seeking a speedy and amicable solution.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to the other arguments raised by the respondent to resist an indemnity costs order. The first is that the offer was made rather late, after trial had started. There is nothing in O\u00a022A which restricts the time by which an offer to settle may be made. In the scheme of things, such an offer could be made at any time. Obviously, the later it is made, the less it would serve the purpose of the scheme which is to resolve a litigation speedily and less expensively. The trial of the action commenced on 22\u00a0April 2002. It was part-heard. The resumed hearing was in October 2002. This was followed by submissions of the parties. Judgment was delivered only on 18\u00a0July 2003. An acceptance of the offer would, of course, have brought the action to an early close and saved costs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next is the point that the question of law in issue in the action was a highly controversial one. That is not in dispute. It will be recalled that in <i>Data General</i> the offer by the plaintiff to settle was at 100% of the sum claimed but in view of the complex nature of the case, the court exercised its discretion in not ordering indemnity costs against the defendant. In the present case, it was not the plaintiff (the respondent) who made the offer but the defendant (the appellants), and, more importantly, the offer was substantial and constituted more than 50% of the sum eventually awarded by the court below (not including costs). It is precisely in a case such as this, where the question of law involved is of some complexity, that there should be some give and take on both sides. Viewed in this light, the offer of the appellants was a serious one, deserving of consideration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The last point of the respondent is that much of the time at the trial was spent in establishing the fault of the engine. This is neither here nor there. To establish its claim, the respondent had to prove three things: (a)\u00a0a duty of care on the part of the appellants; (b)\u00a0there was a breach of that duty; and, (c)\u00a0the respondent had suffered losses. The fact that the respondent managed to establish two of the three elements does not mean that the respondent should only bear the costs relating to the element on which it failed. The respondent failed in the action and must bear the costs of the action. It would be different where a defendant raised unmeritorious defences which were rejected by the court and if the defendant should nevertheless succeed on one of the defences the court would be entitled to refuse the defendant costs in relation to work done on those failed defences.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, there is one other matter that may stand in the way of the appellants in their claim for indemnity costs. In [59], we have set out O\u00a022A r\u00a09(3) which governs an offer to settle made by a defendant. For a defendant to be entitled to indemnity costs from the date of the offer to settle, two conditions must be satisfied. First, the offer must be on the table up to the disposal of the claim. Second, the plaintiff has obtained a judgment which is not more favourable than the terms of the offer. In our present case, the appellants\u2019 offer to settle was valid only for 14 days. Thus the first condition is not satisfied. However, the appellants say that r\u00a09(3) is not applicable to a case like the present, where the plaintiff fails completely. There appears to be some merit in this point as r\u00a09(3) talks about the plaintiff being \u201centitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer was served\u201d. The appellants aver that they are relying on the general discretionary powers of the court under O\u00a022A r\u00a09(5) and r\u00a012. These two rules are quoted in [61] above.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question which remains is whether the court, in the exercise of its discretionary power, should have regard to the fact that the offer made by the appellants was valid only for 14 days and had lapsed long before the trial judge rendered her verdict and even longer still by the time the action was concluded on appeal. The term \u201cdisposal of the claim\u201d in O\u00a022A r\u00a09(3) must refer to the final disposal of the claim where there is an appeal. The corresponding provision applying to an offer to settle emanating from a plaintiff, which is set out in O\u00a022A r\u00a09(1), also contained a similar condition. Therefore, the question is whether the court should apply a different consideration where the plaintiff fails completely. We are unable to see any rational basis for waiving that condition just because a plaintiff fails completely instead of partially. It seems to us that the rationale for requiring an offer to remain on the table until judgment, before penalising the offeree party with indemnity costs, is that that party would have been able to accept the offer at all times but had refused to do so.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, in the circumstances of the present case, we are not inclined to accede to the appellants\u2019 request for indemnity costs.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright

the court):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was an appeal against the decision of the judge awarding judgment to Merriwa Nominees Pty Ltd (\u201cthe respondent\u201d) on 8\u00a0January 2004 and ordering Romar Positioning Equipment Pte Ltd (\u201cthe appellant\u201d) to render an account, <i>inter alia</i>, of moneys owed to the respondent. We heard the appeal and allowed it on 26\u00a0August 2004. We now give our reasons.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The facts</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant is a Singapore company. It is in the business of manufacturing, supplying and acting as consultants in automated welding equipment and metal work machinery. The respondent is a company incorporated in Western Australia with a place of business at Perth. It is in the business of providing specialised drilling technology and services.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In early 2000, the appellant approached the respondent to inquire whether the latter was interested to enter into a joint venture to provide specialised drilling services to an Indian company, Reliance Engineering Associates Private Limited (\u201cReliance\u201d), with whom the appellant had established contact. After several discussions between the appellant\u2019s managing director, Jonathan Lim (\u201cLim\u201d), and the respondent\u2019s managing director, James Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d), it was agreed that the two parties would jointly undertake the venture.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On or about 13\u00a0November 2000, the appellant entered into an agreement with Reliance (\u201cthe Reliance Agreement\u201d) to provide technical assistance, direction and supervision for the installation of a network of optic fibre cables throughout India (\u201cthe project\u201d). Although the appellant alone contracted with Reliance, it was agreed that the contracted works would be provided by both parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 1\u00a0December 2000, the appellant and the respondent entered into two written agreements, one being a Service Agreement and the other a Partnership Agreement. Under the Service Agreement, the respondent was to train and provide sufficient personnel to be employed by the appellant to enable the company to fulfil its obligations under the Reliance Agreement. In consideration of this, the appellant would, within three business days after it had received payment from Reliance for the services rendered, provide to the respondent the details of the payment received and all reasonable expenses incurred under the Reliance Agreement, as well as a cheque for an amount equal to half of the payment received by the appellant (less reasonable expenses incurred).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the period between December 2000 and September 2001, the respondent recruited and trained personnel for the appellant. By September 2001, the appellant had paid the respondent US$165,000 for the latter\u2019s share of the services provided to Reliance. This sum was in addition to amounts paid to Johnson for his work as one of the specialists employed in the project.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reliance\u2019s delay in paying invoices issued by the appellant caused unhappiness to the respondent. The respondent accused the appellant of withholding payments from and of not accounting fully to it. The respondent would not accept the appellant\u2019s explanation that Reliance was responsible for the delay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After an exchange of telephone calls and e-mails between Lim and Johnson on the accounts issue, a meeting took place on 7\u00a0February 2002 in Australia, at the office of the respondent\u2019s Perth solicitors, attended by the respondent\u2019s solicitor Chris Stokes (\u201cStokes\u201d). The parties reached an agreement at the meeting to settle their differences. It was agreed that the appellant would pay the respondent a sum of US$325,000 (\u201cthe settlement sum\u201d) in full and final settlement of all claims between them in connection with the Service Agreement. The settlement sum would be paid in three instalments, <i>viz</i> US$250,000 upon the signing of the settlement agreement, US$50,000 on or before 31\u00a0May 2002 and US$25,000 on or before 31\u00a0July 2002.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Lim had to return to Singapore on the same day, it was agreed that Stokes would draw up the settlement agreement and fax a copy to Lim\u2019s Singapore office for his signature. A deed of settlement and release (\u201cthe Deed\u201d) was subsequently prepared by Stokes. Clause\u00a01 of the Deed reflected the agreement to pay the settlement sum by three fixed instalments in accordance with the time frame stated above. Clause\u00a07 provided that the Deed would not be effective until the full settlement sum had been received by the respondent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also on the same day (7\u00a0February 2002), Stokes faxed a copy of the Deed to Lim for his signature, under cover of a letter. Lim duly executed the Deed and forwarded it to Stokes\u2019 office.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 8\u00a0February 2002, the appellant\u2019s solicitors received a letter from the respondent\u2019s Singapore solicitors confirming the settlement agreement and stating that a copy of the Deed was signed by the appellant and another copy was signed by the respondent. The letter also gave details of the bank account into which the settlement sum was to be paid. However, no copy of the signed Deed was attached to the letter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the same day, the appellant\u2019s solicitors hand-delivered a draft of US$250,000 to the respondent\u2019s Singapore solicitors together with a request for a copy of the signed Deed. There being no response, the appellant\u2019s solicitors wrote again on 16\u00a0May 2002 to the respondent\u2019s Singapore solicitors for a copy of the Deed; this was before the second payment was due.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 31\u00a0May 2002, the appellant\u2019s solicitors forwarded to the respondent\u2019s Singapore solicitors the second instalment of US$50,000 due that day, even though they had still not received a copy of the signed Deed. The appellant\u2019s solicitors made a third request for a copy of the Deed by their letter dated 28\u00a0June 2002, giving notice therein that the final payment (when due) would only be set aside, unless a copy of the Deed duly executed by the respondent was received by them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By a letter dated 29\u00a0July 2002 from Stokes\u2019 law firm to the appellant, the respondent gave notice that it no longer considered itself bound by the Deed because of alleged misrepresentations on the part of Lim. (The appellant said it only received the letter on 2\u00a0August 2002). Two days earlier, the appellant had obtained a draft for US$25,000 in payment of the final instalment due that day. However, the draft was never tendered to the respondent. Instead, on 1\u00a0August 2002, the appellant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the respondent\u2019s solicitors giving notice that a draft for US$25,000 had been issued and would only be released in exchange for the Deed. The solicitors followed up with another letter dated 26\u00a0August 2002 to the respondent\u2019s solicitors, rejecting the respondent\u2019s allegations of misrepresentations and electing to treat the Deed as valid and subsisting.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The proceedings below</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 2\u00a0April 2003, the respondent commenced action against the appellant for breach of contract in failing to render accounts and to make payment in accordance with cl\u00a02.3 of the Service Agreement. The statement of claim also pleaded that the Deed was vitiated because the respondent (Johnson) had been induced to enter into the Deed by alleged misrepresentations on the part of the appellant (Lim). The appellant\u2019s defence was that there had been satisfaction and discharge of the respondent\u2019s cause of action by reason of the Deed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the first day of trial, the respondent sought and obtained leave from the court to amend its reply to include a new basis for vitiating the Deed in addition to the plea of misrepresentation. The respondent pleaded in para\u00a04 of the Amended Reply that cl\u00a07 of the Deed stated that the Deed was not effective until the respondent had received all three instalments. Since the last instalment of US$25,000 was not received by it, the respondent averred that the Deed was not effective.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge ruled in favour of the respondent on the ground that the appellant\u2019s defence of accord and satisfaction was not made out. There was no finding that any misrepresentation vitiated the Deed. Instead, the respondent\u2019s new plea in the Amended Reply was accepted and the Deed was held to be ineffective because the third payment was not made on time. The trial judge took the view that the appellant\u2019s act of purchasing the bank draft of US$25,000 did not suffice as the payment was not actually tendered. He rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the final payment was not tendered because it was conditional upon receipt from the respondent of a copy of the executed Deed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The issues</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two issues arose for determination in this appeal:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Could the appellant rely on the Deed as a valid defence to the respondent\u2019s claim notwithstanding that the third and final instalment of US$25,000 was not paid on the due date of 31\u00a0July 2002?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should the last-minute amendment to the Reply have been allowed?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Did the Deed constitute a valid defence notwithstanding the non-payment of the final instalment?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated earlier at [17], the trial judge made no finding on the respondent\u2019s allegation of misrepresentation which purportedly induced it to enter into the Deed. Consequently, the only issue to be determined on appeal was whether non-payment of the final instalment rendered the Deed unenforceable.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The crux of the appellant\u2019s case was that payment of the instalments was conditional upon its receipt of a copy of the executed Deed. Therefore, it was entitled to withhold payment of the last instalment of US$25,000 until it received a copy of the Deed, which never came. The trial judge had rejected this argument of counsel for the appellant on the basis that it was not a pleaded defence (see <nobr>[2004] SGHC 78</nobr> at [14]). His finding overlooked the fact that it was the respondent who first raised this issue by its eleventh hour amendment of para\u00a04 of the Reply.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was our view that the appellant had succeeded on the first limb of its appeal. We accepted its counsel\u2019s submission that it was a condition precedent to the appellant\u2019s obligation to pay under the Deed, that the respondent would firstly sign and secondly forward a copy of the signed Deed to the appellant in exchange for payment of the first instalment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the context of contracts, the words \u201ccondition precedent\u201d have two meanings. According to Kim Lewison\u2019s <i>The Interpretation of Contracts</i> (3rd\u00a0Ed, 2004) at para\u00a015.02:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A condition precedent is a condition which must be fulfilled before any binding contract is concluded at all. The expression is also used to describe a condition which does not prevent the existence of a binding contract, but which suspends performance of it until fulfilment of the condition.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clause\u00a01(a) of the Deed provided that the first instalment of US$250,000 would be paid \u201cupon the signing of this agreement\u201d. This meant that signing of the agreement was a condition precedent to the appellant\u2019s obligation to pay the first instalment, under the second meaning referred to in [22] above.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the respondent failed to fulfil the condition precedent by furnishing a copy of the signed Deed to the appellant, the latter\u2019s obligation to pay the settlement sum did not arise. The non-production of the Deed was a valid defence as the appellant did not waive its right to be given a copy, judging by its repeated requests to the respondent\u2019s solicitors for the document, notwithstanding its payment of the first and second instalments. It was perfectly entitled to withhold payment of the third and final payment of US$25,000. Indeed, we had grave doubts that the respondent signed the Deed at all. It was admitted by counsel for the respondent that the Deed was not in the respondent\u2019s list of documents filed for the trial and he could not offer any explanation for the omission. As a half-hearted justification, he pointed out that the appellant did not in any event ask for discovery of the document in the court below. We noted that the Deed was also not produced before us.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0Yim for the appellant had also referred the court to an undated internal note of Johnson which his clients had obtained in the process of discovery from the respondent. The following are extracts from that note:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Suggested plan of attack</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After the next $50,000 has been transferred start new action threatening to take legal action in Singapore</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Fly to India and speak to Reliance directly</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Contact all trade centers and blacklist him</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">He thinks my Achilles heel is the taxation but I don't think so</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Possible renege on excepting [<i>sic</i>] final payment from Lim</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Target getting another $250,000 of him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The note clearly revealed the respondent\u2019s intentions to renege on the Deed. Counsel also referred to extracts from the cross-examination at the trial of Johnson on the above note.</span><a id=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[1]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">He submitted that it showed that Johnson was evasive. The appellant surmised that the respondent withheld a copy of the signed Deed (if indeed it was signed by the respondent) as part of the latter\u2019s strategy to frustrate the appellant\u2019s payment of the final instalment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would also be appropriate at this juncture to address the following submission in the Appellant\u2019s Case (at p\u00a050):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It was an express and/or implied term of the Deed, alternatively, the [respondent] had made a collateral warranty, that the signed Deed would be given to the [appellant] upon payment by the [appellant] of the first US$250,000.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At law, a term may be implied into a contract to give effect to the presumed intention of the contracting parties. That intention may be gathered from the express words of the contract and the facts and circumstances surrounding it. <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> (29th\u00a0Ed, 2004) vol\u00a01 at para\u00a013-004 states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 The court will be prepared to imply a term if there arises from the language of the contract itself, and the circumstances under which it is entered into, an inference that the parties must have intended the stipulation in question. An implication of this nature may be made in two situations: first, where it is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, and secondly, where the term implied represents the obvious, but unexpressed, intention of the parties. \u2026 Both, however, depend on the presumed intention of the parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The tests were reaffirmed by our courts recently in <i>Hiap Hong &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Hong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 458</nobr> and <i>Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2003] 3 SLR 307</nobr>. The first or \u201cbusiness efficacy\u201d test was laid down by Bowen\u00a0LJ in <i>The Moorcock</i> (1889) 14\u00a0PD 64 at 68 whilst the second or \u201cofficious bystander\u201d test was propounded by MacKinnon\u00a0LJ in <i>Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926), Limited</i> <nobr>[1939] 2 KB 206</nobr>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> went on to add (at para 13-009):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A term ought not to be implied unless it is in all the circumstances equitable and reasonable. But this does not mean that a term will be implied merely because in all the circumstances it would be reasonable to do so or because it would improve the contract or make its carrying out more convenient. \u201cThe touchstone is always <i>necessity</i> and not merely <i>reasonableness.</i>\u201d\u2026 A term will not be implied if it would be inconsistent with the express wording of the contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning to the facts of this case again, we noted that the parties arrived at a binding agreement during a meeting at the Perth office of the respondent\u2019s solicitors. The parties also agreed that a formal deed of settlement would be drafted to reflect the agreement. One may well ask, why was there a need for a document if a verbal agreement had already been reached? Presumably (and logically), it was to have written proof of such a settlement. Hence, it was further agreed that the parties would sign the Deed in counterparts, for one party to ensure that the other party had signed. It was therefore reasonable and necessary to imply a term (be it under the \u201cbusiness efficacy\u201d test or the \u201cofficious bystander\u201d test) that the Deed, signed by the respondent, would be forwarded to the appellant before the appellant was required to make any payment under the Deed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our view was reinforced by Stokes\u2019 fax to Lim of 7\u00a0February 2002 of which para\u00a03 stated:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In accordance with your telephone discussion with James Johnson and myself of this afternoon, <i>it is agreed that a signed copy of the Deed of Release will be provided to you by our Singapore Agents in exchange for your bank cheque in the sum of US$250,000</i> made payable to the Mohan Singh trust account.

However, the Plaintiffs had refused to accept payment and attempted to repudiate the said Deed</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the premises, by reason of the Deed of Settlement and Release, there has been satisfaction and discharge of the Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged cause/s of actions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent relied on the definition of accord and satisfaction from <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> (28th\u00a0Ed, 1999) at para\u00a023-012, for its submission that the appellant could not rely on that plea as a defence, since the appellant had failed to pay the last instalment:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Accord and satisfaction is the purchase of a release from an obligation whether arising under contract or tort by means of any valuable consideration, not being the actual performance of the obligation itself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, when Johnson was cross-examined in the court below</span><a id=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[2]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">he admitted that the respondent had decided, on or about 26\u00a0June 2002, not to be bound by the Deed. It did not therefore lie in the respondent\u2019s mouth to say there was no accord and satisfaction due to non-payment of the final instalment, when it itself had decided to renege on the Deed before the final instalment was due on 31\u00a0July 2002</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Should the amendment to the Reply have been allowed?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although we decided in the appellant\u2019s favour on the first issue, we will, for completeness, address the second limb of its appeal. Had it been necessary to do so to determine the outcome of the appeal, we would have reversed the order made below for the respondent to amend its Reply.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant mounted two arguments in relation to its objection to the amended Reply. First, the application was made at a late stage of the proceedings. Second, the amendment raised a new ground of claim which was inconsistent with that pleaded in the Statement of Claim and which would not be allowed under O\u00a018 r\u00a010(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d). Order\u00a018 r\u00a010(1) reads:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A party shall not in any pleading make an allegation of fact, or raise any new ground or claim, inconsistent with a previous pleading of his.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The appellant cited various English authorities to support its first objection (<i>Williamson v London and North Western Railway Company</i> (1879) 12\u00a0Ch\u00a0D 787; <i>Kingston v Corker</i> (1892) 29\u00a0LR\u00a0Ir 364; <i>Herbert v Vaughan</i> [1972] 3\u00a0All\u00a0ER 122).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is not in dispute that under O\u00a020 r\u00a05 of the Rules, a court has the discretion to grant leave to amend a pleading at any stage of the proceedings. This could be before or during the trial, or even after judgment or on appeal. Delay <i>per se</i> therefore does not automatically prevent the application from succeeding, unless it will result in an injustice to the other party, which cannot be compensated by an appropriate order for costs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this case, however, the respondent applied to amend its Reply on 5\u00a0January 2004, almost eight months after the original Reply was filed on 9\u00a0May 2003. The amended para\u00a04 of the Reply states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The plaintiffs deny that there had been satisfaction and discharge by reason of the Deed of Settlement and Release <i>in view of the matters pleaded in paragraphs\u00a016 to 21 of the statement of claim and in particular for the reason that the said Deed is ineffective, clause\u00a07 of the Deed providing that the agreement is not effective until all funds have been received into the plaintiffs' solicitors' bank account and confirmation of that receipt has been provided by the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors. All funds payable under the Deed has not been received into the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors\u2019 bank account.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(The italicised words reflect the amendment.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was difficult to find any reason that could justify the delay in the respondent\u2019s application. The amendment did not arise out of any new facts or circumstances which came to the attention of the respondent only at a late stage of the proceedings. The consequence of the amendment was that the appellant became aware of the respondent\u2019s new stand, that the Deed was unenforceable due to non-payment of the final instalment, only on the first day of trial. Arguably, this prejudiced the appellant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It bears remembering that the function of a reply is to allow the plaintiff to raise facts in answer to the defendant\u2019s case. In particular, it will be necessary to file a reply if the defendant raises a new issue for the first time in the defence. As the function of a reply is limited to answering matters raised in the defence, it follows that the reply should not be used as an avenue to introduce new causes of action which are not raised in the statement of claim. If a plaintiff wishes to raise an additional and inconsistent claim in the alternative after the statement of claim has been filed, the proper approach should be to apply to amend the statement of claim, rather than slip it in by way of the reply.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the original Statement of Claim, the respondent pleaded that the Deed was unenforceable as it was vitiated by the appellant\u2019s misrepresentations. The appellant came to court prepared to meet that case (in para\u00a021 of the Statement of Claim). In the Amended Reply, however, the respondent pleaded that the Deed was ineffective because the appellant failed to pay the final instalment, a position which was diametrically opposite to its original stand. It was an inconsistent plea which should have been made in the alternative in the Statement of Claim. As was said by G\u00a0P\u00a0Selvam\u00a0J in <i>Nirumalan K Pillay v A Balakrishnan</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 322</nobr> at [10], a case cited by the appellant:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The reply serves the function of answering points raised in the defence so that the defendant is given notice of matters which are intended to defeat a defence or explain a matter raised in the defence in a way favourable to the plaintiffs. \u2026 Further, because the function of a reply is to answer matters raised in the defence, its contents must relate to matters raised in the defence. What is the same thing, the plaintiffs may not supplement [their] statement of claim by including in [their] reply matters which ought to have been included in the statement of claim. In this respect, a reply is analogous to re-examination of a witness which should be confined to matters touched on in cross-examination. Fresh evidence adding to or re-affirming evidence-in-chief is not permitted in re-examination.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An appellate court will normally not interfere with a lower court\u2019s discretion to grant or refuse an amendment unless that court has exercised that discretion wrongly (see <i>Wright Norman v Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</i> <nobr>[1994] 1 SLR 513</nobr>). However, the respondent in this case succeeded on its claim below based purely on its Amended Reply, there being no finding on the allegation of misrepresentation. The amendment was made without any explanation for the lateness and it prejudiced the appellant. It should not have been allowed. Consequently, the appellant would also have succeeded on the second limb of its appeal, had it been necessary for us to make that ruling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Decision\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Appeal allowed.</span></p>\n\n<div><br clear=\"all\"/>\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Verbatim notes pp\u00a064\u201367</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[2]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">See verbatim notes p\u00a047</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n"]
