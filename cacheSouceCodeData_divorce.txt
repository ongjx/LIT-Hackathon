The appellant contended that Kan Ting Chiu J, who heard the parties` respective appeals against the decision of District Judge Khoo Oon Soo, erred on three counts. The first concerned the amount which the appellant was required to pay the respondent for her share of their matrimonial home. The second concerned the quantum of the lump sum maintenance payable by the appellant to the respondent. The third concerned Kan J`s ruling that the appellant`s shares in two companies, which were received in exchange for shares given to him by his grandparents and father before and after his marriage to the respondent, formed part of the matrimonial assets available for division between the parties.<br/><br/><strong><i> Background </i></strong><br/><br/>The appellant married the respondent on 4 July 1980. The appellant and the respondent have two children. Their first child, their only son, was born in September 1981 and their second child, their only daughter, was born in January 1984.<br/><br/>Throughout the marriage, the appellant worked in his family`s group of companies. He was a director of many of the companies within the group, and was an executive director of the public-listed Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd. The respondent was a full-time housewife, who took charge of the household and the welfare of their children.<br/><br/>The parties` marriage broke down after almost 12 years. On 1 July 1992, the parties entered into a deed of separation, following which the husband [appellant] moved out of their then matrimonial home. On 14 March 1997, the respondent filed a petition for divorce against the appellant on the ground that the marriage had broken down irretrievably, in that the couple had been separated for at least three years. The petition was not opposed. A decree nisi was granted on 3 June 1997. At an ancillary hearing which followed, the respondent was awarded sole custody, care and control of the two children, with reasonable access to the husband.<br/><br/><strong><i> The district judge`s decision </i></strong><br/><br/>The hearing on the remaining ancillary matters took place subsequently before District Judge Khoo Oon Soo, who gave his decision on 7 May 1999.<br/><br/>The district judge`s first order, which concerned the matrimonial home of the parties, was as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>45% of the value of Astrid Meadows (45% of $4,380,000 [equals] $1,971,000) (round up - $2m).  </p>\n        <p>If sale, respondent to make his own refunds to CPF, to pay outstanding mortgage fees and expenses relating to sale.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>As for the question of maintenance, the district judge awarded the respondent a lump sum of $960,000. The lump sum was calculated on the basis of a monthly maintenance of $8,000 over a period of ten years.<br/><br/>As for the parties` other matrimonial assets, the district judge held that the respondent was entitled to 25% of the value of these assets. He also ruled that the appellant`s shares in two companies, Lee Kim Tah Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as `LKTH`) and Lee Kim Tah Investments Pte Ltd (hereinafter referred to as `LKTI`) were to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets available for division between the parties.<br/><br/>Whether or not the LKTH and LKTI shares formed part of the matrimonial assets was a hotly contested issue in the courts below and in this court. As such, the history of these shares ought to be considered at this juncture. Between 1977 to 1982, the appellant`s grandparents and father gave him a substantial number of shares in three companies within the Lee Kim Tah group of companies. The shares were as follows:   </p>\n    <p>(a) 10,407 shares in Lee Realty (Pte) Ltd </p>\n    <p>(b) 278,285 shares in Lee Development (Pte) Ltd </p>\n    <p>(c) 28,000 shares in Lee Kim Tah (Pte) Ltd.<br/><br/>In August 1982, two years after the parties were married, the Lee Kim Tah group of companies underwent an amalgamation exercise. As a result of this exercise, all the shareholders of Lee Realty (Pte) Ltd, Lee Development Pte Ltd and Lee Kim Tah (Pte) Ltd transferred their shares to LKTH in exchange for shares of the same value. The purpose of the exchange of shares was to make LKTH the holding company of Lee Realty (Pte) Ltd, Lee Development Pte Ltd and Lee Kim Tah (Pte) Ltd, so that LKTH could be listed on the board of the Singapore Stock Exchange. As the transfers and exchange of shares were made pursuant to a scheme of amalgamation, no ad volarem stamp duty was payable. At the time of the hearing, the appellant owned 1,800,000 shares in LKTH.<br/><br/>In June 1984, some four years after the marriage of the parties, the shareholders of LKTH transferred a portion of their shares in exchange for shares of equivalent value in LKTI. This was also done pursuant to an amalgamation scheme, which was intended to ensure that the Lee family continued to have collective control over LKTH after its public listing, which took place in July 1984. Again, no ad volarem stamp duty was payable as the transfer and exchange of shares were made pursuant to a scheme of amalgamation. At the time of the hearing, the appellant had 3,606,279 shares in LKTI.<br/><br/>The appellant contended that the restructuring of his family companies did not alter the nature of the original gifts given to him by his grandparents and father. This argument was accepted by the district judge, who ruled that the appellant`s LKTH shares and LKTI shares, which were valued at $4,956,279 in April 1999, were not to be included in the pool of assets to be divided between the parties.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeal to the high court </i></strong><br/><br/>Both parties appealed to the High Court on varying grounds. Although neither party appealed against the order relating to the division of the matrimonial home, Kan J, who heard the appeal, decided to alter the wording of the district judge`s order so as to `reflect its effect more succinctly`. The redrafted order provided as follows:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The [respondent] is to receive $2m as her share of the property at Block 48 Henley Court [num ]06-04 Astrid Meadows, Coronation Road West, Singapore 269263.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The judge further ordered the appellant to pay the $2m to the respondent within three months from the date of the redrafted order.<br/><br/>As for the question of maintenance for the respondent, the judge upheld the district judge`s order that a lump sum payment of $960,000 be made by the appellant.<br/><br/>With respect to the appellant`s shares in LKTH and LKTI, the judge allowed the wife`s appeal and reversed the district judge`s finding that the said shares were not matrimonial assets. His Honour noted that the shares which had been given to the appellant by his grandparents and father had been exchanged for shares in LKTH and LKTI and said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The husband argued that the LKTH and LKTI shares are not matrimonial assets under s 112(10) [of the Women`s Charter], but I disagreed with him. The gift in the original companies were no longer in existence at the time of division. He had accepted the offer to exchange them for new shares. The new shares did not come from the donors and were not gifts received in the course of amalgamation.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> The present appeal </i>\n      </strong>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellant, who was dissatisfied with the judgment of Kan J, appealed against his decision. His counsel asserted the following:   </p>\n    <p>(a) The judge erred when he ordered the appellant to pay the respondent $2m for her share of the matrimonial home at Astrid Meadows. </p>\n    <p>(b) The judge erred when he upheld the district judge`s award of a lump sum payment of $960,000 to the respondent as maintenance. </p>\n    <p>(c) The judge erred when he overruled the district judge`s ruling that the appellants` shares in LKTH and LKTI be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets available for division between the parties.<br/><br/><strong> The matrimonial home at Astrid Meadows</strong></p>\n    <p>The reason for the appeal concerning the matrimonial home at Astrid Meadows is simple. The district judge awarded the respondent $2m for her share of the matrimonial home on the basis that the property was worth $4.38m, a value ascribed to it by M/s Edmund Tie &amp; Company in their valuation report dated 24 October 1997. The sum awarded is approximately 45% of $4.38m. As it turned out, the property was finally sold for $3.5m. The appellant pointed out that if he was required to pay $2m to the respondent out of the gross proceeds of sale, the respondent would in fact receive 57% of the proceeds of the sale of the property.<br/><br/>The problem which has arisen has its roots in the manner in which the district judge`s order was worded. Admittedly, the original order should have been in clearer terms. All the same, it is important to note that no evidence was furnished with respect to the value of the matrimonial home at the hearing before the district judge other than the valuation report of M/s Edmund Tie, which valued the property at $4.38m. No one objected to the reliance by the district judge on this report for the purpose of dividing the matrimonial home during the hearing of the  ancillary matters. Indeed, the appellant did not appeal against the district judge`s order on the division of the matrimonial home when he lodged his appeal to the High Court with respect to the district judge`s other orders. In our view, it is now too late for the appellant to object to the reliance by the district judge on the valuation report of M/s Edmund Tie.<br/><br/>The appellant explained that he did not appeal against the district judge`s order with respect to the division of the matrimonial home because he was prepared to let her have $2m if he kept the property for himself. On the other hand, if the matrimonial home was sold in the market, the respondent should only have 45% of the gross sale proceeds. There is nothing in the district judge`s order which supports the approach suggested by the appellant. In fact, in [para ] 59 of his grounds of decision, the district judge said as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... I gave the [husband], in respect of Astrid Meadows, a choice of either paying [the wife] $2m without sale or to pay <strong> this sum</strong> from the gross proceeds of sale. [Emphasis added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>When the appellant appealed to the High Court, he appeared to have accepted that he had to pay the respondent $2m. In his written submissions, counsel for the appellant stated as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It was also ordered by the learned district judge on 7 May 1999 that the [wife] be entitled to 45% of the matrimonial home at Astrid Meadows, which share shall be ascribed the rounded-off value of $2m, the said $2m to be paid by the [husband] to [wife] forthwith, either from the net proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial property or otherwise. The [husband] has not appealed against this order ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We see no merit in the appellant`s appeal on the division of the matrimonial home and we accordingly dismiss it.<br/><br/><strong> Maintenance for the respondent</strong></p>\n    <p>The respondent had asked for a lump sum maintenance of $1,680,000, which was based on a monthly maintenance of $14,000 for ten years. She did not get what she asked for as the district judge awarded her a lump sum maintenance of $960,000, calculated on the basis of $8,000 per month for ten years. This award was upheld by the High Court judge.<br/><br/>The appellant did not object to the award of lump sum maintenance to the respondent. However, he asserted that for the purpose of quantifying the lump sum, the monthly maintenance ought to be pegged at $4,000 a month and not $8,000 a month. As such, he took the view that he should pay the respondent $480,000.<br/><br/>When making maintenance orders, note must be taken of s 114(2) of the Women`s Charter, which provides that the court should endeavour `to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other`. Section 114(1) requires the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(a) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;  </p>\n        <p>(b) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;  </p>\n        <p>(c) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;  </p>\n        <p>(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;  </p>\n        <p>(e) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;  </p>\n        <p>(f) the contributions made by each of the parties to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and  </p>\n        <p>(g) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In this case, the parties had a rather luxurious lifestyle and it is surprising that counsel for the appellant submitted that it was not common ground that the respondent had enjoyed a very high standard of living while she was married to the appellant. To begin with, the parties lived in a large apartment in a luxurious condominium in a prime area. They took expensive holidays, bought first or business class air tickets, stayed at expensive resorts and hotels and dined at the finest and most expensive restaurants at home and abroad. They also had the use of chauffeured cars and the services of maids. Furthermore, the family had the use of facilities at clubs such as the Singapore Island Country Club, the American Club, the British Club and the Bukit Timah Saddle Club. Lavish purchases for the children, such as a grand piano, which cost $85,000, and a computer system, which cost $38,000, also shed some light on the parties` lifestyle.<br/><br/>The respondent is now 45 years old. She was married to the appellant for almost 12 years and bore him two children. She contributed to the welfare of the family during the marriage by looking after the home and caring for the family. She has not worked for the past 17 years, and the possibility of her being able to return to the workforce to earn enough to sustain the lifestyle she has become used to is rather remote. In the light of the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the respondent while married to the appellant, the lump sum maintenance awarded to her by the district judge is not excessive.<br/><br/>The appellant is obviously a man of substantial wealth and means. He is an executive director of LKTH, a well-known company in Singapore`s construction and property development industry. While his monthly salary may have been stated as $16,000, the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by his family during the marriage reveals that he must have had alternative and substantial sources of income. He is also expected to receive bonuses, directors` fees, dividends from his shareholdings, as well as other perks from his family group of companies. The district judge came to the conclusion that the appellant`s monthly income was clearly in excess of $20,000. In short, he is certainly in a position to afford the payment of the lump sum maintenance awarded to the respondent.<br/><br/>For the purpose of determining the appropriate amount of maintenance for the respondent, the division of the parties` matrimonial assets and the property and other financial resources which the parties have or are likely to have in the foreseeable future were also taken into account. The fact that the respondent has  been awarded $2m for her share of the matrimonial home was not overlooked. We also noted that, for reasons which will be stated later on in this judgment, the appellant`s LKTH and LKTI shares are not included in the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided between the parties. If all the factors relevant to an order for maintenance including the parties` age, the duration of the marriage, the lifestyle enjoyed during the marriage and the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future are borne in mind, the appellant has no reason to complain about the lump sum maintenance awarded to the respondent. The appellant`s appeal on the quantum of maintenance is thus dismissed.<br/><br/><strong> The LKTH and LKTI shares</strong></p>\n    <p>The appellant also appealed against the High Court judge`s decision to include his LKTH and LKTI shares in the pool of matrimonial assets.<br/><br/>For the purpose of determining whether or not the LTKH and LTKI shares may be regarded as matrimonial assets, note must be taken of section 112(10) of the Women`s Charter, which provides as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>For the purposes of this section, `matrimonial asset` means -</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(a) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage -  </p>\n        <p>(i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or  </p>\n        <p>(ii) which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage; and  </p>\n        <p>(b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellant contended that his LKTH shares and LKTI shares are within the ambit of the proviso in s 112(10) of the Women`s Charter as they were gifts from his grandparents and father. As such, they ought to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets available for division because the respondent had done nothing to enhance the value of the said shares. On the other hand, the respondent contended that as the said shares were issued to the appellant in exchange for shares which were given to him by his grandparents and father, the LKTH and LKTI shares were `acquired` during the marriage and thus fell within the ambit of s 112(10)(b) of the Women`s Charter. As such, they ought to be part of the pool of matrimonial assets. She relied on two decisions of this court,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hoong Khai Soon v Cheng Kwee Eng</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1993:3:34:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1993:3:34:\">  [1993] 3 SLR 34 </a> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Koh Kim Lan Angela v Choong Kian Haw</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1994:1:22:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1994:1:22:\">  [1994] 1 SLR 22 </a>, both of which were decided before s 112(10) of the Women`s Charter was enacted.<br/><br/>In <strong><i> Hoong Khai Soon v Cheng Kwee Eng </i></strong>, a question arose as to whether or not a husband`s undivided half share in a house, No 1B Haji Salam, was a matrimonial  asset to be divided between the husband and the wife. It was accepted that half the payment for the said house came from the proceeds of the sale of another house, No 7 Bedok Rise, which was a gift to the husband from his parents. Notwithstanding this, it was held that No 1B Jalan Haji Salam was a matrimonial asset to be divided between the husband and the wife. Lai Kew Chai J, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that it would be inimical to the concept of a matrimonial partnership if the source of funds for every asset acquired during marriage had to be shown not to originate from the generosity of a third party.<br/><br/>A similar approach was adopted by this court in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Koh Kim Lan Angela v Choong Kian Haw</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1994:1:22:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1994:1:22:\">  [1994] 1 SLR 22 </a>. In that case, the husband and his father each owned 50% of a partnership, Glamourette. His shares in Glamourette were a gift from his father. The husband also had shares in two other family companies. He owned 50% of the shares in Glamourette Plus Pte Ltd (`Plus`) and 20% of the shares in Glamourette Shops Pte Ltd (`Shops`). After his marriage, the family business was reorganised with a view to expanding it jointly with an outsider, Ambassador. For this purpose, the business of Glamourette was injected into Plus and the capital of Plus was increased to $2m. 49% of the capital of Plus was issued to the husband and his father while the remaining 51% was issued to Shops. The husband and his father then sold their shares in Plus to Ambassador for four million Ambassador shares of $1 each, with the husband and his father each having two million shares in Ambassador. It was held by the Court of Appeal, overruling the trial judge, that the two million Ambassador shares were acquired during the marriage. Karthigesu JA made it clear that the fact that the Ambassador shares had been acquired in exchange for the husband`s shares in Plus did not prevent the asset from being an asset which could be divided between the husband and the wife.<br/><br/>It is evident that the fact that property is acquired during a marriage in exchange for a gift to a husband or wife does not, without more, prevent the new asset from becoming a matrimonial asset to be divided between the husband and wife. However, different considerations arise where the true nature of a gift remains intact. For instance, if a husband, who received a gift of 500,000 shares in X Company before his marriage from his father, was issued 500,000 new share certificates after his marriage following X Company`s change of name to Y Company, it would, without more, be inequitable to hold that the husband`s shares in Y Company are matrimonial assets on the ground that they were `acquired` after his marriage.<br/><br/>The present case is of course different from that of a mere change of name but it is nonetheless distinguishable from <strong><i> Angela Koh </i></strong>`s case [1994] 1 SLR 22, where the gift shares were injected into another family business before being exchanged for shares in a totally unrelated company for the purpose of expanding the family business jointly with that other company. The present case is also distinguishable from <strong><i> Hoong Khai Soon </i></strong>`s case [1993] 3 SLR 34, where the proceeds from the sale of a house, which was a gift to the husband, were used to pay for part of the purchase price of another house.<br/><br/>In the present case, what the appellant received as gifts from his grandparents and father were, in essence, 20% of the value of the family business. The asset which the appellant had at the time of the hearing before the district judge, namely shareholdings in LKTH and LKTI, was the same asset which he had been given between 1977 to 1982, namely a proportionate share in the family business. In short, the appellant retained his proportionate share in the underlying business throughout the amalgamations, which did not change the nature or substance of the gift. It would thus be wrong to place the LTKH and LTKI shares into the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided between the appellant and the respondent.<br/><br/>The only remaining question is whether or not the respondent had done anything to enhance the value of the shares. If she had, either on her own or jointly with the appellant, the shares would, by virtue of s 112(10) of the Women`s Charter, be part of the pool of matrimonial assets. It is evident from <strong><i> Hoong Khai Soon </i></strong>`s case [1993] 3 SLR 34 that there must be a direct causal link between the efforts, if any, and the substantial improvement. There was no evidence whatsoever of how the wife had substantially improved the value of the shares. In view of this, the appellant`s shares in LKTH and LKTI do not form part of the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided between the appellant and the respondent. The appellant`s appeal in relation to these shares is thus allowed.<br/><br/>Costs<br/><br/>When considering the question of costs, it must be borne in mind that while the appellant succeeded in his appeal with respect to the exclusion of his LKTH and LKTI shares from the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided, he failed in his appeal regarding the amount due to the respondent for her share of the matrimonial home and in his appeal on the quantum of lump sum maintenance. Taking all circumstances into account, we are of the view that each party should bear his or her own costs of the appeal and of the hearing in the High Court.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\"

  <Para level=\"1\" no=\"1\" pID=\"p1_1\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This is an unus ual and unfortunate case, notwithstanding the important point of law that arises. It is unusual because a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> (\u201cthe Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>\u201d) issued by a Singapore court pursuant to an uncontested divorce petition is now sought to be rendered a nullity in circumstances where <Emphasis type=\"i\">the husband has already passed away</Emphasis>. It is unfortunate, not only because of the husband\u2019s death, but also because there appears to be a high degree of animosity and acrimony between the parties. This may, in part at least, explain why the proceedings have been so vigorously prosecuted from the district court right up to this court despite the relatively small amount that is actually at stake.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"2\" pID=\"p1_2\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The applicants (\u201cthe Appellants\u201d), who are seeking, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, a declaration that the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> is null and void, are the executors of the husband\u2019s (\u201cthe Husband\u201d) estate and are the beneficiaries of the bulk of this estate under the Husband\u2019s will dated 26\u00a0January 2002 (\u201cthe Will\u201d). If the Appellants are successful in this appeal (and their application), the wife (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d) will receive only what she is entitled to under the Will and will receive nothing from the ancillary orders that were made pursuant to the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> (which the Respondent has also appealed against (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Hou Wa Yi v Yap Kiat Cheong</Emphasis> [2009] SGDC 464 and below at [21])).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Against this backdrop, the issue which arises in this appeal is whether the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> is a nullity on the basis that the marriage between the parties had, at the time the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> was issued, already been dissolved by a prior divorce judgment issued by the Shanghai court (\u201cthe Shanghai divorce judgment\u201d). This issue raises an important point of law as to whether or not the Shanghai divorce judgment is <Emphasis type=\"i\">against public policy</Emphasis> and should therefore <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> be recognised by the Singapore courts. If the Shanghai divorce judgment is recognised by the Singapore courts, the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> would be a nullity and consequently, the Respondent would not be entitled to receive her share of the matrimonial assets pursuant to the ancillary orders made by the Singapore court on the back of the grant of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We should pause to note \u2013 as we did at the outset of oral submissions before this court \u2013 that the issue with respect to recognition of the Shanghai divorce judgment is one of two main strings to the Appellants\u2019 legal bow. The other main string is in the Appellants\u2019 argument that the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> had been granted contrary to relevant facts which, in turn, cast doubt on the factual basis for the grant of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, that the Husband and the Respondent had lived apart for four years before the filing of the divorce petition). As we intimated to counsel during oral submissions before us, we are of the view that both the District Judge (\u201cthe DJ\u201d) and the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) were correct in rejecting this argument and we therefore do not say anymore on this, save to make brief references where relevant. We are thus left with the first string which raises the question of whether the Shanghai divorce judgment is against public policy and should accordingly not be recognised in Singapore (which we will hereafter refer to as \u201c<Emphasis type=\"bi\">Issue\u00a01</Emphasis>\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n          <Emphasis type=\"i\">However</Emphasis>, as we mentioned during oral submissions to counsel for the Appellants, Mr\u00a0Koh Tien Hua (\u201cMr\u00a0Koh\u201d), <Emphasis type=\"i\">even if</Emphasis> we were to hold that the Shanghai divorce judgment ought to be recognised (contrary to the views of both the DJ and the Judge), this would <Emphasis type=\"i\">not necessarily</Emphasis> conclude the appeal in favour of his clients. There is a further issue, which the Judge had also alluded to, which is whether, on the assumption that the Appellants are acting as <Emphasis type=\"i\">the Husband\u2019s personal representatives</Emphasis>, they are (due to <Emphasis type=\"i\">the Husband\u2019s</Emphasis> actions which would be attributed to them as his personal representatives) guilty of an abuse of process of the court under the well-established doctrine of extended <Emphasis type=\"i\">res judicata</Emphasis> and are, as a result, barred from raising the Shanghai divorce judgment as part of their case (we will hereafter refer to this as \u201c<Emphasis type=\"bi\">Issue\u00a02</Emphasis>\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">When faced with the difficulties with his clients\u2019 case arising from Issue\u00a02, Mr\u00a0Koh then argued at the oral hearing \u2013 <Emphasis type=\"i\">contrary to</Emphasis> what was stated in the original application <Emphasis type=\"i\">and</Emphasis> what he had maintained in the proceedings below \u2013 that the Appellants should be considered as having brought the application for declaratory relief in their <Emphasis type=\"i\">personal capacities</Emphasis> so that any actions by the Husband could not be attributed to them (we will hereafter refer to this as \u201c<Emphasis type=\"bi\">Issue\u00a03</Emphasis>\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Before proceeding to consider each of these issues <Emphasis type=\"i\">seriatim</Emphasis>, we set out in more detail the facts and background as well as the respective decisions of the DJ and the Judge in the courts below.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The facts</Heading>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The marriage</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On 21\u00a0August 1991, the Husband, a Singapore citizen, married the Respondent, a Chinese national, and registered their marriage in Shanghai (\u201cthe Shanghai Ceremony\u201d).

He had, however, overlooked the fact that at the time of his marriage to the Respondent in Shanghai, he was still legally married to his previous wife. The Husband married his previous wife in Singapore on 28\u00a0September 1959. At the time of the Shanghai Ceremony, he had only obtained a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> (as opposed to a decree absolute) in respect of his previous marriage. For this, he was charged with bigamy in January 1992 and the Respondent was deported. The charge was later dropped.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On 1\u00a0June 1992, a decree absolute was granted dissolving the Husband\u2019s previous marriage in Singapore. This paved the way for the Respondent\u2019s return to Singapore. The Husband and the Respondent then solemnized and registered their marriage in Singapore on 30\u00a0September 1992 (\u201cthe Singapore Ceremony\u201d). They lived in Singapore thereafter.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The divorce proceedings</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"11\" pID=\"p1_11\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Unfortunately, the marriage broke down. From July 2000 onwards, the Husband and the Respondent began living in separate rooms. On 25\u00a0April 2001, the Husband commenced, in Singapore, Divorce Petition No\u00a0601380 of 2001 seeking a dissolution of the marriage due to the Respondent\u2019s unreasonable behaviour. This petition was contested by the Respondent and the Husband subsequently withdrew it on the understanding that they would proceed with the divorce on an uncontested basis. In November 2002, the Respondent left Singapore and returned to Shanghai for good.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">The Shanghai divorce proceedings</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On 13\u00a0July 2004, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in the Min Xing District People\u2019s Court in Shanghai (\u201cShanghai first instance court\u201d). The Respondent contested the proceedings on the basis that the marriage in Shanghai was null and void since the Husband was still legally married to his previous wife at the time of the Shanghai Ceremony. In addition, she took the position that divorce proceedings should be commenced in Singapore instead of Shanghai.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On 24\u00a0March 2004, the Shanghai first instance court ruled against the Respondent and granted the divorce (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the Shanghai divorce judgment). The court agreed with the Respondent that the marriage was not valid at its inception but held that it became valid <Emphasis type=\"i\">from</Emphasis> 1\u00a0June 1992, when the Husband obtained the decree absolute in respect of his previous marriage in Singapore.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Dissatisfied, the Respondent appealed against the Shanghai divorce judgment. On appeal, the Respondent argued substantially the same points while the Husband adopted the reasoning of the court below. She argued that by reason of the decree absolute, \u201cthe situation causing the marriage to be void was no longer in existence, thus the marriage registration of both parties in Shanghai had become a valid marriage\u201d.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"15\" pID=\"p1_15\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On 20\u00a0June 2005, the Shanghai No\u00a01 Intermediate People\u2019s Court (\u201cthe Shanghai appellate court\u201d) dismissed the appeal. The Shanghai appellate court explained that the marriage law \u201cstipulates that the People\u2019s Court shall not grant an application for a declaration that a marriage is void when the situation causing the marriage to be void is no longer in existence at the time of the application\u201d.

The Husband responded by filing a summons to strike out D\u00a02201 but subsequently withdrew it. One year later, the Respondent amended the petition by deleting the reference to the Husband\u2019s unreasonable behaviour. This time, she cited as the basis for the divorce the fact that she and the Husband had lived apart for a continuous period of at least four years prior to the filing of D\u00a02201.

The first application was an originating summons filed on 2\u00a0June 2008 in the High Court. This application was withdrawn on 30\u00a0September 2008.

Accordingly, the court gave orders in respect of the division of the Singapore assets only. The Husband subsequently requested for further arguments to be presented to the effect that a shophouse, worth $1.7m, should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets since the Respondent had agreed to this. On 19\u00a0November 2009, this request was granted and the ancillary orders were varied to exclude the shophouse from the pool of matrimonial assets. The assets remaining in the matrimonial pool comprised property, shares and several sums of money in bank accounts. Under the ancillary orders made, the Respondent was awarded $62,176.87 as her share in the matrimonial assets and lump sum maintenance of $14,400, adding up to a total of $76,576.87.

The Appellants also argued that there had been material facts that had not been placed before the court granting the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>. These facts, which were extracted from the various documents filed in the convoluted divorce proceedings and the maintenance application for M, demonstrated that the Respondent and the Husband had not, in fact, lived apart for the requisite period of four years. The Appellants averred that the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> was therefore granted on the basis of facts which have now been shown to be untrue. The Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>, and consequently the ancillary orders made pursuant to it, should therefore be declared null and void or rescinded.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The respective decisions in the courts below</Heading>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The decision of the District Court</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The decision of the District Court may be found in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yap Chai Ling and another v Hou Wa Yi</Emphasis> [2014] SGDC 299. The DJ began by considering if there was a marriage to dissolve in D\u00a02201. She held that there was a marriage to dissolve in D\u00a02201. In her view, it was \u201cabundantly clear that the Shanghai court was hearing the husband\u2019s application to dissolve the Shanghai marriage\u201d given that \u201c[t]here was no reference whatsoever to the Singapore marriage either in the Shanghai court or the Shanghai appellate court judgements [<Emphasis type=\"i\">sic</Emphasis>] or record of proceedings\u201d (at [23]). The question to her mind was \u201cwhether the dissolution of the Shanghai marriage dissolved all marriage relationship between the husband and wife even though there is the Singapore marriage\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">ibid</Emphasis>). This issue turned on whether the Shanghai divorce judgment ought to be recognised in Singapore as having dissolved the marriage relationship between husband and wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"28\" pID=\"p1_28\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The DJ held that the Shanghai divorce judgment was repugnant to Singapore law and contrary to public policy. While both Chinese law and Singapore law had a policy against bigamous marriages, there was a crucial difference in so far as Chinese law accepted that the bigamous marriage between the Husband and the Respondent became valid when the Husband obtained a decree absolute for his previous marriage. Under Singapore law, a marriage that was bigamous in its inception could not become valid by a subsequent dissolution of the subsisting marriage (at [23]). As a result, the DJ held the Shanghai divorce judgment ought not to be recognised in Singapore.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"29\" pID=\"p1_29\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Turning to the second argument, the DJ found that there was no basis to conclude that the Husband and the Respondent did not live apart for four years (at [30]). First, the Appellants\u2019 assertions were not based on any personal knowledge of the marital affairs of the Husband and the Respondent. Secondly, the Husband, who was legally advised at all times, had himself relied on separation since July 2010 as the ground for divorce in his Shanghai divorce petition. Thirdly, the Husband did not contest the divorce proceedings, which were instituted by the Respondent on the basis that there had been separation between them for at least four years. Finally, in both his applications to have the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> declared void, the only ground raised was that the marriage had already been dissolved by the Shanghai courts and the Husband stated that he and the Respondent had lived apart for four years (at [31]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"30\" pID=\"p1_30\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The DJ also considered that grave prejudice and injustice would be suffered by the Respondent if the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> were to be set aside. She noted that the Husband had \u201cin his lifetime ... applied to rescind the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> \u2026 after the divorce was granted and in any event he withdrew his applications\u201d (at [32]). If the Appellants were successful, the Respondent would be denied her share of the matrimonial assets pursuant to the ancillary orders made by the court and would only receive $1,000 under the Will. For all the above reasons, she dismissed the Appellants\u2019 application with costs.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The decision of the High Court</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"31\" pID=\"p1_31\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The decision of the High Court may be found in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yap Chai Ling and another v Hou Wa Yi</Emphasis> [2016] 1\u00a0SLR 660 (\u201cthe GD\u201d). The Judge began her analysis with a discussion of s\u00a099(2) of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), which was the section that the Appellants\u2019 application was expressed as being taken out under. The Judge identified four constituent parts of s\u00a099(2) of the Act (\u201cs\u00a099(2)\u201d): (a)\u00a0the jurisdictional requirement; (b)\u00a0the standing requirement; (c)\u00a0a substantive requirement; and (d)\u00a0a discretionary component (see the GD at [31]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"32\" pID=\"p1_32\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In so far as the jurisdictional requirement was concerned, the Judge referred to the decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah and another</Emphasis> [1987] SLR(R) 702 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Sivakolunthu</Emphasis>\u201d) for the proposition that divorce proceedings do not abate upon the death of one of the parties to the marriage such that the court is deprived of jurisdiction over all subsequent matters in relation to the marriage. The key question was whether further proceedings could be taken and this depended on the nature of the further proceedings and the relevant statutory provisions engaged. The Judge found that, despite the death of the Husband, s\u00a099(2) was still applicable because the Appellants were challenging the enforceability of the ancillary orders and not merely the status of the marriage (see the GD at [34]\u2013[35]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"33\" pID=\"p1_33\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In so far as the standing requirement was concerned, the Judge undertook a comprehensive survey of the historical origin of s\u00a099(2) and agreed with both counsel that, under s\u00a099(2), any member of the public, <Emphasis type=\"i\">save for the parties to the marriage</Emphasis>, had standing. There were two reasons for this. First, proceedings for divorce were not merely a personal matter but were also a matter of public importance and members of the public should be allowed to show cause why a decree should not be made absolute, especially in light of the fact that parties to an unhappy marriage had an incentive to collude to procure a divorce. It has been the longstanding position in England, from which s\u00a099(2) has its roots, that parties to the marriage could not avail themselves of this provision. Second, to allow the parties themselves to mount an attack on a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> under s\u00a099(2) would be to allow them a further opportunity to re-litigate a matter to which they had been a party, and this would therefore engage the doctrine of <Emphasis type=\"i\">res judicata</Emphasis> (see the GD at [37]\u2013[45]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"34\" pID=\"p1_34\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Despite this, the Appellants maintained that they were acting as personal representatives. They claimed to have standing because they had a legitimate expectation that an order by the court is one that is sound and correct and not procured by misrepresentation. The Judge disagreed and found that, if they were bringing the action as personal representatives, they would not have standing. However, the Judge went on to rule that they could be allowed to bring their action under s\u00a099(2) in their own names and allowed them to do so in that capacity (see the GD at [53]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"35\" pID=\"p1_35\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Turning to the substantive requirement, the Judge read the words \u201cany person may show cause why the [decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis>] should not be made [final] by reason of material facts not having been brought before the court\u201d appearing in s\u00a099(2) as raising the following three questions: (a)\u00a0are the facts material in that they relate to the grant of the decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis>; (b)\u00a0were these facts before the court that granted the decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis>; and (c)\u00a0has sufficient cause been shown in that the facts raised must be completely incompatible with or must vitiate the basis for the grant of the decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis>? Finally, even if the substantive requirements were fulfilled, the court nevertheless retained a discretion whether or not to set aside the decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> granted (see the GD at [54]\u2013[56]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"36\" pID=\"p1_36\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the issue concerning the effect of the Shanghai divorce judgment, the Judge expressed her difficulty with the structure of the Appellants\u2019 prayer for declaratory relief because, even though it was purportedly brought under s\u00a099(2), there was no mention of that section in the submissions. The Appellants\u2019 submission appeared to rest merely on the fact that there was no marriage to be dissolved by the Singapore courts and, on this point alone, the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> should be set aside. The Judge opined that this was not crucial and proceeded to reframe the Appellants\u2019 argument as one under s\u00a099(2).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"37\" pID=\"p1_37\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Before analysing whether the Shanghai divorce judgment should be enforced, a clarification was made by the Judge in respect of the marital status of the Husband and the Respondent. The DJ appeared to suggest that there could be multiple subsisting marriage relationships which could exist in parallel with each other and could be dissolved separately (see above at [27]). The Judge noted that, in so far as the DJ suggested the proposition just mentioned, it was clearly wrong (see the GD at [61]). The Judge referred to the Singapore High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Noor Azizan bte Colony (alias Noor Azizan bte Mohamed Noor) v Tan Lip Chin (alias Izak Tan)</Emphasis> [2006] 3\u00a0SLR(R) 707 for the proposition that there can only be one marriage relationship between the parties, even though husband and wife undergo two or more marriage ceremonies. Marriage concerns the legal status of those who have entered into the marital union and, as a corollary, a divorce, which effects the dissolution of the marital union, operates on the marital status and not on the ceremonies or solemnizations preceding the formation of the marriage as such. The Judge thus held that the purport of the Shanghai divorce judgment was the determination of the marital status of the Husband and the Respondent (see the GD at [62]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"38\" pID=\"p1_38\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In so far as the Shanghai divorce judgment was concerned, the Judge found that its presence was indeed a material fact which should have been brought before the court. However, the Judge found that it was not incompatible with the grant of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> since the Shanghai divorce judgment ought <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> to be recognised on grounds of public policy. In her view, the regularisation of a bigamous union after the legal impediment to such a marriage no longer existed was contrary to our public policy against bigamous marriages, which is a cornerstone of our marriage law. To recognise the Shanghai Divorce Judgment would be to recognise that a bigamous marriage could be regularised (see the GD at [67]\u2013[71]). The Appellants thus failed in respect of this argument.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"39\" pID=\"p1_39\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the facts relating to the four years separation, the Judge found that sufficient cause had not been shown as the facts alleged did not vitiate the foundation of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>. The facts had not shown that the Husband and the Respondent resumed the <Emphasis type=\"i\">consortium vitae</Emphasis> and, even if they did, there was no evidence that this lasted for a period of six months or more (see the GD at [78]\u2013[80]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"40\" pID=\"p1_40\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge concluded her decision with a discussion of the discretionary component in s\u00a099(2) even though her analysis up to that point was sufficient to dispose of the appeal. She explained that she would <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis>, in any event, have rescinded the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>. First, the Respondent would have been denied ancillary relief in respect of the Singapore assets even though both the Husband and she agreed that the Singapore assets were to be dealt with by the Singapore courts. Secondly, it was an abuse of process to raise these facts now since they should properly have been raised at the hearing for the grant of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>. Finally, the conduct of the Appellants in applying for the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> to be made absolute should also be held against them since they had failed to act with reasonable expedition, causing further delay with consequential detriment to the Respondent. For all of these reasons, the Judge dismissed the appeal.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Our decision</Heading>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Issue\u00a01</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"41\" pID=\"p1_41\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">To recapitulate, Issue\u00a01 is whether the Shanghai divorce judgment is against public policy and should therefore not be recognised. As already noted above, both the DJ and the Judge had held that this divorce judgment was against public policy and should therefore not be recognised.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"42\" pID=\"p1_42\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We digress, for a moment, to make three brief observations. First, we are in complete agreement with the Judge in relation to her analysis of the marital status of the Husband and the Respondent (see above at [37]). To reiterate, although there were two different ceremonies in this case (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the Shanghai Ceremony and the Singapore Ceremony), there remained but one marriage between the Husband and the Respondent. References to the \u201cShanghai marriage\u201d and the \u201cSingapore marriage\u201d were merely convenient shorthand ways of denoting the different <Emphasis type=\"i\">possible</Emphasis> commencement dates of the union between the Respondent and the Husband.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"43\" pID=\"p1_43\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Secondly, we also agree that the purport of the Shanghai divorce judgment was to terminate the marital status of the Husband and the Respondent. Counsel for the Respondent, Ms\u00a0Dorothy Chai (\u201cMs\u00a0Chai\u201d), submits that the Shanghai divorce judgment dissolved only the \u201cShanghai marriage\u201d as it made no reference to the \u201cSingapore marriage\u201d or the Singapore Ceremony. We reject this submission. It is apparent to us that the Shanghai court was pronouncing a divorce over the status of the parties. This is consistent with the fact that marriage is a legal status and there can only be one marriage between the parties (see above at [42]). Furthermore, there seems to us to be no reason for the Shanghai court to have referred to the Singapore Ceremony, once it had decided that there was a valid marriage between the parties from 1\u00a0June 1992 (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the date the Husband obtained a decree absolute for his previous marriage). Since, through the legal lenses of the Shanghai court, the marriage started from that date, there was no need to refer to the \u201cSingapore marriage\u201d or Singapore Ceremony which was held later (on 30\u00a0September 1992).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"44\" pID=\"p1_44\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Finally, we address the Judge\u2019s difficulty with the manner in which the Appellants\u2019 framed their argument for declaratory relief (see above at [36]). The Judge noted that no reference was made to s\u00a099(2) in the submissions of the Appellants but nevertheless recharacterised the argument as being brought under s\u00a099(2). It appears to us that the Appellants were not relying on s\u00a099(2) in their arguments. Rather, they were relying on the more fundamental premise that the grant of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> was a complete nullity because there was no subsisting marriage to dissolve after the Shanghai divorce judgment. Assuming that the Appellants\u2019 arguments were premised on s\u00a099(2), the Judge opined that, if the Appellants were acting in their capacity as personal representatives of the Husband (as Mr\u00a0Koh had maintained), they would not have the requisite standing. Nevertheless, the Judge allowed the Appellants to canvass this point before her on the basis that they were acting in their own capacities and not as personal representatives (see above at [33]\u2013[34]). In our view, the Appellants are mounting the argument that the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> is a nullity <Emphasis type=\"i\">qua </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">personal representatives</Emphasis> and <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> in their personal capacities. That the Appellants are acting in that capacity is clearly stated in the originating summons. Indeed, during the oral submissions before us, Mr\u00a0Koh took the position that the Appellants were acting as personal representatives until we highlighted that there may be a further barrier for his clients to surmount in the form of the doctrine of extended <Emphasis type=\"i\">res judicata</Emphasis>. This prompted him to take the position instead that the Appellants were acting in their personal capacities. For these reasons, we shall proceed on the footing that the Appellants were acting as personal representatives (as noted earlier, we will deal with Mr\u00a0Koh\u2019s argument that the Appellants were, instead, acting in their personal capacities in our analysis of Issue\u00a03).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"45\" pID=\"p1_45\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Returning to the main issue, which is whether the Shanghai divorce judgment ought to be recognised, it is critical, in our view, to clarify what the precise issue was before the courts below and, of course, what it is before us now. In this regard, it is of paramount importance to appreciate that the concept of public policy is not one that can \u2013 particularly in the context of cross-jurisdictional disputes in the conflicts of laws sphere (as is the case here) \u2013 be applied liberally. This should be unsurprising as there is also the countervailing (and no less) vital consideration of the concept of comity of nations. Additionally, the concept of public policy is itself inherently difficult.

As evidenced by the Shanghai court decisions, under Chinese law, there was a valid marriage from 1\u00a0June 1992. Under Singapore law, there was a valid marriage from 30\u00a0September 1992 (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the Singapore Ceremony). Therefore, <Emphasis type=\"bi\">at the time of the Shanghai divorce judgment</Emphasis>, it cannot be gainsaid that there was indeed a marriage between the Husband and the Respondent.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"49\" pID=\"p1_49\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The next question is whether the Shanghai divorce judgment would be effective, <Emphasis type=\"i\">as a matter of Singapore law</Emphasis>, to bring to an end the marriage between the Husband and the Respondent.

It is also clear that this was the view adopted by the Judge given that Shanghai was the domicile of the wife (see the GD at [65]). As explained in Debbie Ong, <Emphasis type=\"i\">International Issues in Family Law in Singapore</Emphasis> (Academy Publishing, 2015) (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">International Issues in Family Law</Emphasis>\u201d), recognition of foreign matrimonial proceedings is governed by the common law and the court will recognise foreign decrees made by a court of competent jurisdiction (at para\u00a05.47). It is further explained that the position now, with the abolition of the wife\u2019s dependent domicile (see s\u00a047 of the Act), is that it is sufficient that a foreign decree is granted by a court of either party\u2019s domicile (see the Singapore High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Asha Maudgil</Emphasis> v <Emphasis type=\"i\">Suresh Kumar Gosain</Emphasis> [1994] 2\u00a0SLR(R) 427 at [18] as well as <Emphasis type=\"i\">International Issues in Family Law</Emphasis> at para\u00a05.53). As Shanghai was the wife\u2019s domicile, the Shanghai divorce judgment is an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. All of this points towards recognition.</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"50\" pID=\"p1_50\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">However, Ms\u00a0Chai, relying on the Singapore High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Ho Ah Chye v Hsinchieh Hsu Irene</Emphasis> [1994] 1\u00a0SLR(R) 485 (at [53] and [68(g)]), argues that recognition should be refused as enforcement would be manifestly contrary to public policy. She submits that the <Emphasis type=\"i\">law</Emphasis> in Shanghai is <Emphasis type=\"i\">different from</Emphasis> that in Singapore inasmuch as the former viewed the Husband\u2019s lack of capacity to marry as but a temporary legal obstacle to the validity of his marriage registered in Shanghai \u2013 this legal obstacle could be (and was) cured by the grant of a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">absolute</Emphasis> in respect of the Husband\u2019s previous marriage. Under Singapore law, on the other hand, no such curing or regularisation was possible. Hence, the argument went, that to recognise the Shanghai divorce judgment would be repugnant to public policy as it would be tantamount to accepting that a bigamous marriage can be regularised.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"51\" pID=\"p1_51\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We note, on the other hand, Mr\u00a0Koh\u2019s citation of the decisions of both the Singapore High Court and this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Burswood Nominees Ltd (formerly Burswood Nominees Pty Ltd) v Liao Eng Kiat</Emphasis> [2004] 2\u00a0SLR(R) 436 and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Liao Eng Kiat v Burswood Nominees Ltd</Emphasis> [2004] 2\u00a0SLR(R) 690, respectively. In the former decision, Lai Siu Chiu\u00a0J observed, in the context of the attempted enforcement of a judgment debt in relation to a wagering contract, that \u201cthe fact that if the present contract between the parties had been governed by Singapore law the contract could be invalid or void \u2026 does not mean that it, being governed by Nevada law and valid under that law, may not be enforced in Singapore\u201d. Hence, by parity of reasoning, the fact that Chinese law adopts a different legal position in respect of monogamous marriages which were bigamous in their inception from Singapore law does <Emphasis type=\"i\">not necessarily</Emphasis> entail a finding that Chinese <Emphasis type=\"bi\">public policy</Emphasis> is contrary to Singapore <Emphasis type=\"bi\">public policy</Emphasis>.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"52\" pID=\"p1_52\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">What is crucial, in our view, is what the <Emphasis type=\"bi\">public policy</Emphasis> in relation to marriage is in both jurisdictions. When viewed in this light, it is indubitable that the <Emphasis type=\"bi\">public policy</Emphasis> in <Emphasis type=\"bi\">both</Emphasis> jurisdictions is <Emphasis type=\"biul\">the same</Emphasis>. Simply put, both the Chinese <Emphasis type=\"bi\">and</Emphasis> the Singapore legal systems <Emphasis type=\"bi\">only recognise a regime of </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">monogamous </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">marriages</Emphasis>. The corollary of this is that <Emphasis type=\"bi\">both</Emphasis> these legal systems would <Emphasis type=\"biul\">not</Emphasis> recognise <Emphasis type=\"bi\">bigamous</Emphasis> marriages. The only (<Emphasis type=\"i\">specific</Emphasis>) difference lay in the approach adopted in a situation where one of the parties to the marriage had only obtained a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> in respect of a previous marriage as opposed to a decree absolute. As we have already noted, under <Emphasis type=\"i\">Chinese</Emphasis> law, such a marriage could be rendered valid (or cured) when the decree absolute is eventually obtained, whereas there was no provision under <Emphasis type=\"i\">Singapore</Emphasis> law to this effect. However, this (particular) difference does <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis>, in our view, lead to the conclusion that the respective <Emphasis type=\"bi\">public policies</Emphasis> in China on the one hand and Singapore on the other are thereby <Emphasis type=\"i\">in conflict</Emphasis>. Indeed, even the \u201ccurative\u201d approach adopted pursuant to Shanghai law is <Emphasis type=\"i\">intended to ensure that the (non-negotiable) rationale of </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">monogamy </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"i\">is maintained</Emphasis>. We therefore, respectfully, disagree with the Judge that recognition of the Shanghai divorce judgment would be contrary to public policy.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"53\" pID=\"p1_53\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In any event, we fail to see how recognition of the Shanghai divorce judgment \u201cwould be tantamount to acknowledging that a bigamous marriage may be regularised\u201d (see the GD at [68]). It is important to once again emphasise the fact that the <Emphasis type=\"i\">difference</Emphasis> between the <Emphasis type=\"i\">laws</Emphasis> of Shanghai and Singapore is one that relates, in substance and effect, to <Emphasis type=\"bi\">the date of the commencement of the marriage</Emphasis>, <Emphasis type=\"biul\">whereas</Emphasis>, as already noted earlier in this judgment, the <Emphasis type=\"bi\">precise issue</Emphasis> in the present appeal relates, instead, to whether <Emphasis type=\"bi\">a foreign divorce judgment</Emphasis> (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the Shanghai divorce judgment) ought to be recognised by the Singapore courts. As we have explained, it is incontrovertible that the Husband and the Respondent were legally married (regardless of the precise date of commencement of the marriage) at the time of the Shanghai divorce judgment. Recognising the Shanghai divorce judgment would <Emphasis type=\"i\">only</Emphasis> require the Singapore courts to recognise that there was a <Emphasis type=\"bi\">subsisting marriage</Emphasis> between the parties at the date of the said divorce judgment. Recognition does not require the court to acknowledge that the marriage had indeed commenced on 1\u00a0June 1992, as declared by the Shanghai courts. We emphasise that there already was, at the very least and as a matter of Singapore law, a marriage between the parties <Emphasis type=\"bi\">from</Emphasis> 30\u00a0September 1992. Therefore, recognition of the Shanghai divorce judgment does not amount to an acknowledgement that bigamous marriages may be regularised.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"54\" pID=\"p1_54\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We pause to note, however, that whether differences between jurisdictions on matters of public policy are engaged in questions of enforcement <Emphasis type=\"bi\">must depend on the particular facts in question</Emphasis>. By way of illustration, the public policy in relation to <Emphasis type=\"i\">regularisation of bigamous marriages</Emphasis> would, in our view, have been engaged if the Shanghai court had awarded maintenance to the wife for the period between the grant of the decree absolute in respect of the Husband\u2019s previous marriage and the registration of the Husband and Respondent\u2019s marriage in Singapore and the Respondent had sought to enforce that maintenance judgment in Singapore. The Singapore court would then have had to decide if maintenance <Emphasis type=\"i\">during that period</Emphasis>, which hinges on the regularisation of a bigamous marriage, was contrary to our public policy. <Emphasis type=\"bi\">As observed, that is </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">not </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">the situation in our case.</Emphasis></Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"55\" pID=\"p1_55\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n          <Emphasis type=\"i\">However</Emphasis>, the fact that the Judge was, with respect, wrong in holding that the Shanghai divorce judgment is manifestly contrary to public policy and should therefore not be recognised is (as we have already pointed out above) <Emphasis type=\"bi\">not</Emphasis> conclusive of the present appeal in favour of the Appellants. If the Appellants could be demonstrated (via the relevant actions of the Husband when he was alive) to have abused the process of the court in bringing the present application and appeal, then the Singapore courts (including this court) can <Emphasis type=\"i\">disregard</Emphasis> Issue\u00a01 in so far as it ought to have been raised in earlier proceedings.

In essence, why was the grant of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> not challenged during the divorce proceedings between the Husband and the Respondent on the basis that the Shanghai divorce judgment had already dissolved their marriage and that there was therefore no legal basis upon which the district judge could grant the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>?</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"57\" pID=\"p1_57\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We begin by highlighting certain salient aspects of the manner in which the Singapore divorce proceedings transpired. At the outset, when D\u00a02201 was commenced by the Respondent on 20\u00a0May 2005 (after delivery of the Shanghai divorce judgment), the Husband <Emphasis type=\"bi\">filed a summons to strike out that petition</Emphasis>, <Emphasis type=\"biul\">but </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">subsequently </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">withdrew </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">it</Emphasis>. Initially, the reason stated for the irretrievable breakdown of their marriage was the Husband\u2019s unreasonable behaviour. One year later, the Respondent amended the petition by deleting the reference to the Husband\u2019s alleged unreasonable behaviour, citing instead the fact that she and the Husband had lived apart for a continuous period of at least four years prior to the filing of the said petition as the factual basis for the divorce. We note, parenthetically (as we did right at the outset of this judgment (see above at [4])), that the Appellants had also sought to attack the grant of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> on the ground that there had not in fact been a period of separation of at least four years. In our view, both the DJ and the Judge correctly rejected this argument (see also above at [29] and [39]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"58\" pID=\"p1_58\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n          <Emphasis type=\"bi\">Significantly</Emphasis> for our purposes, <Emphasis type=\"i\">the district judge had</Emphasis>, during the hearing of the ancillary matters (on 17\u00a0December 2007), <Emphasis type=\"i\">questioned the parties as to the legal effect of the Shanghai divorce judgment</Emphasis>. It is pivotal in the context of the present issue to note that <Emphasis type=\"i\">the Husband then proceeded to </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">file </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">two successive applications</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\"> for declarations that the Shanghai divorce judgment had dissolved the marriage and that, therefore, the Respondent\u2019s divorce petition filed in the Singapore court should be struck out and the Decree </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"b\">Nisi </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">that had been granted ought to be rescinded on the basis that at the time D\u00a02201 was filed, there was no subsisting marriage for the Singapore courts to dissolve</Emphasis> (see above at [18]\u2013[19]). In our view, it is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that this is <Emphasis type=\"biul\">exactly</Emphasis> what the Appellants are now arguing. <Emphasis type=\"biul\">More importantly</Emphasis>, whilst the <Emphasis type=\"bi\">first</Emphasis> application was filed on 2\u00a0June 2008 in the High Court, it was <Emphasis type=\"biul\">withdrawn</Emphasis> on 30\u00a0September 2008. <Emphasis type=\"i\">Similarly</Emphasis>, whilst the <Emphasis type=\"bi\">second</Emphasis> application was filed in relation to D\u00a02201 itself, it was <Emphasis type=\"biul\">also withdrawn</Emphasis> by the Husband on 3\u00a0April 2009. After these two applications had been withdrawn, the district judge proceeded to determine the ancillary matters arising from the divorce.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"59\" pID=\"p1_59\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Given the circumstances outlined above, the doctrine of extended <Emphasis type=\"i\">res judicata</Emphasis> as set out (most notably) in the oft-cited English decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Henderson v Henderson</Emphasis> (1843) 3\u00a0Hare 100; 67\u00a0ER 313 applies to prevent the Appellants, who are acting in the capacity as personal representatives of the Husband, from arguing that the grant of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> was a nullity.

On this basis, I did not agree with Ms Chai that this application should be dismissed because the status of the marriage had already been determined. <Emphasis type=\"bi\">There was still a res before the court over which the court may exercise its jurisdiction</Emphasis>\u2026 [emphasis added in bold italics]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"71\" pID=\"p1_71\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">With respect, we are unable to agree with the reasoning set out in the preceding paragraph. As has been explained, the purpose of s\u00a099(2) is for third parties to a marriage to challenge the <Emphasis type=\"biul\">status</Emphasis> of the marriage in circumstances where a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> has been granted. A third party would, ordinarily, have no interest in the ancillary orders made as between the parties to the marriage. Ancillary orders in divorce proceedings generally concern only the parties to the marriage and cannot by any measure be said to be a matter of <Emphasis type=\"i\">public importance</Emphasis>, unlike the <Emphasis type=\"biul\">status</Emphasis> of the marriage. The only reason the Appellants have an interest in this case is because they are also the beneficiaries under the Will. Given that s\u00a099(2) is concerned with the <Emphasis type=\"biul\">status</Emphasis> of the marriage, we are unable to see how it continues to apply once a party to that marriage has <Emphasis type=\"i\">passed away</Emphasis>. The death of one of the parties dissolves a marriage (see s\u00a07(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>) of the Act, also reproduced above at [49]). The status of the marriage has thus already been conclusively determined by the death of the Husband. In these circumstances, s\u00a099(2) no longer remains applicable given that its very purpose concerns the <Emphasis type=\"biul\">status</Emphasis> of the marriage. What the Judge thought to be the core of the appellants\u2019 application (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the enforceability of the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>) is, in our view, more properly described as the <Emphasis type=\"i\">motive</Emphasis> for their application. But the Appellants\u2019 motive in bringing the present application <Emphasis type=\"i\">cannot</Emphasis> change the fact that the <Emphasis type=\"i\">status</Emphasis> of the marriage had been determined by the death of the Husband and that, as a result, s\u00a099(2) no longer has any application.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"72\" pID=\"p1_72\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In a similar vein, in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Hou Wa Yi\u00a02012\u00a0HC</Emphasis>, Choo Han Teck\u00a0J held that the court no longer had any power to make absolute a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> after the death of one of the parties to the marriage. The appellants in that case, who, incidentally, are the Appellants in the present appeal, attempted to rely on s\u00a099(3) of the Act to make this very Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> absolute. Section\u00a099(3) reads as follows:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Where an interim judgment of divorce has been granted and no application for it to be made final has been made by the party to whom it was granted, then, at any time after the expiration of 3\u00a0months from the earliest date on which that party could have made such an application, the party against whom it was granted may make an application to the court and on that application the court may \u2014</Text>\n          <QuoteList level=\"2\" indent=\"none\">\n            <Item>\n              <Label>(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>)</Label>\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">notwithstanding subsection\u00a0(1), make the judgment final;</Text>\n            </Item>\n            <Item>\n              <Label>(<Emphasis type=\"i\">b</Emphasis>)</Label>\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">rescind the interim judgment;</Text>\n            </Item>\n            <Item>\n              <Label>(<Emphasis type=\"i\">c</Emphasis>)</Label>\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">require further inquiry; or</Text>\n            </Item>\n            <Item>\n              <Label>(<Emphasis type=\"i\">d</Emphasis>)</Label>\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">otherwise deal with the case as it thinks fit.</Text>\n            </Item>\n          </QuoteList>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"73\" pID=\"p1_73\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Choo\u00a0J held that once death of one of the parties to the marriage intervened, s\u00a099(3) no longer had any application (at [6]). In our view, this must be correct since s\u00a099(3) also concerns the <Emphasis type=\"biul\">status</Emphasis> of the marriage. As the Judge herself perceptively pointed out, there is a logical unity to ss\u00a099(2) and (3) of the Act (see the GD at [45]). We find it to be incongruous (indeed, a contradiction in terms) if a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> cannot be made absolute once death of a party to the marriage intervenes, but can be set aside by all and sundry, except the parties. If, in fact, this were the case, then it would mean that, in the present case, while the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis> cannot be made absolute, it would remain under constant threat of challenge. There is nothing preventing other unrelated third parties from bringing an application under s\u00a099(2) to set aside the Decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">Nisi</Emphasis>. In the usual course of things, the parties to a marriage can put an end to the possibility of their marital status being challenged by third parties by applying for the decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> to be made absolute. Once the death of one party intervenes, this path is no longer open to them, and we cannot accept that, notwithstanding this, a decree <Emphasis type=\"i\">nisi</Emphasis> obtained <Emphasis type=\"i\">always</Emphasis> remains susceptible to attack by third parties.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"74\" pID=\"p1_74\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">That having been stated, we (like Choo\u00a0J) would also add the caveat that our purposive reading of s\u00a099(2) leads only to the conclusion that the provision is inapplicable on the <Emphasis type=\"biul\">present set of facts</Emphasis>; it does not in any way determine the effect of the Husband\u2019s death on the appeal in relation to the ancillary matters, as that is not in issue before us (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Hou Wa Yi\u00a02012\u00a0HC</Emphasis> at [8]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"75\" pID=\"p1_75\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For completeness, we add that had the Appellants brought the present application for declaratory relief in their <Emphasis type=\"i\">personal capacities </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">without more</Emphasis>, such an application would <Emphasis type=\"bi\">fail</Emphasis> for <Emphasis type=\"bi\">lack of standing, simply because they were not asserting a right personal to them; the rights at stake resided in the Husband and the Respondent instead</Emphasis> (see the decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Karaha Bodas Co\u00a0LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another appeal</Emphasis> [2006] 1\u00a0SLR(R) 112 at [15]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"76\" pID=\"p1_76\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the premises, the Appellants must fail in respect of Issue\u00a03.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"77\" pID=\"p1_77\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the reasons set out above, the appeal is dismissed.

For the first time in the various transfer orders, it is stated specifically that leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal from a decision of the High Court, when exercising its appellate jurisdiction, is required. We will refer to such a decision as \u201can appellate decision\u201d of the High Court for convenience. For completeness, we should add that the substance of the old para\u00a06 under the 2003 Transfer Order was reiterated in the new para\u00a06(3).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The new para\u00a06(2) still applies today. Mr\u00a0Koh Tien Hua, counsel for the Wife, contended that because para\u00a01(2) of the 2004 Transfer Order stipulates that the new para\u00a06 shall apply to any appellate decision of the High Court made on or after 1\u00a0November 2004 and because Phang\u00a0J\u2019s decision was made on 7\u00a0March 2006, the Husband was required to obtain leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal which he had not done.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Husband\u2019s primary contention was that leave was not required. However, presumably as a matter of caution, he filed an application (after the Wife\u2019s application to strike out the appeal was filed) for an extension of time to apply for leave should we determine that leave was required.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0Ooi Oon Tat, counsel for the Husband, relied on the Saving Provision because the Wife\u2019s divorce petition was filed on 17\u00a0July 2003, <i>ie</i>, before the cut-off date of 15\u00a0December 2003. Significantly, the 2004 Transfer Order had left the Saving Provision intact.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, Mr\u00a0Koh relied heavily on para\u00a01(2) of the 2004 Transfer Order. He submitted that the intention of the 2004 Transfer Order was to require leave to be obtained for any intended appeal from an appellate decision of the High Court on or after 1\u00a0November 2004, irrespective of when a divorce proceeding had been presented. However, there was no evidence before us of the intention behind the 2004 Transfer Order. In any event we had to consider the 2003 Transfer Order, as amended, in its entirety.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0Koh also had another argument. He pointed out that in <i>IW v IX</i> <nobr>[2006] 1 SLR 135</nobr> (\u201c<i>IW</i>\u201d), the Court of Appeal had accepted that leave to appeal must be obtained in respect of a custody order made by the High Court after 1\u00a0December 2004 even though the divorce petition there was filed on 19\u00a0October 2001 <i>ie</i>, before the cut-off date stipulated in the Saving Provision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We shall deal with the case of <i>IW</i> first. It is significant to note that in <i>IW</i> the parties had accepted that leave to appeal must first be obtained. That is why the Court of Appeal proceeded on that basis in that case. Also, apparently, the Saving Provision was not brought to the attention of the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, in our view, <i>IW</i> was of no assistance to the issue facing us, <i>ie</i>, whether the Saving Provision still applies in the face of para\u00a01(2) of the 2004 Transfer Order.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Mr\u00a0Koh\u2019s submission was correct, it would mean that the Savings Provision would be rendered nugatory. On the other hand, it is possible to reconcile the Saving Provision with para\u00a01(2) of the 2004 Transfer Order. The approach will then be first to see when the divorce petition is filed. If it is filed before 15\u00a0December 2003, then para\u00a01(2) does not apply at all and no leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal is required.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, if the divorce petition is filed after 15\u00a0December 2003, then the date of the appellate decision of the High Court becomes relevant. If that decision is before 1\u00a0November 2004 then, again, no leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal is required. However, if the divorce petition is filed on or after 15\u00a0December 2003 and if the appellate decision of the High Court is made on or after 1\u00a0November 2004, then leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal is required. In our view, that is the correct position.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would also add that although the earlier written submissions for the Wife relied on O\u00a056 r\u00a03 of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2004\u00a0Rev Ed) and s\u00a034 (meaning s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>)) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed) to support the contention that leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was required, Mr\u00a0Koh orally informed us that he was not relying on s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) for that contention. Accordingly, we need not say anything else about s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances, we dismissed the Wife\u2019s application with costs and the Husband\u2019s application for an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal became academic.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Slightly over two years later, on 29\u00a0November 2002, the Wife applied for leave under s\u00a094 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d) to commence divorce proceedings before the expiration of three years from the date of marriage. Her application was dismissed. Nevertheless, the parties did not reconcile and the Wife filed a second divorce petition on 17\u00a0July 2003. The decree <i>nisi</i> was granted on 19\u00a0September 2003. The district judge in the Family Court found that, effectively, the marriage lasted for only 19 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This appeal concerns the division of two matrimonial assets, namely, the apartment known as 259 Onan Road (\u201cthe matrimonial home\u201d) and the apartment situated at 373 Onan Road #01-10 Malvern Springs (\u201cMalvern Springs\u201d). It is necessary to elaborate on the manner in which these two properties were acquired.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The matrimonial home was jointly purchased by the parties in July 2000. The Husband and the Wife made lump sum payments of $74,740.46 and $39,659.54 respectively from their accounts with the Central Provident Fund Board (\u201cCPF\u201d). The Husband made an additional cash down payment of $137,600. The remainder of the purchase price was financed by a bank loan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The parties agreed that the Wife would be responsible for the monthly loan instalments and would pay these from her CPF account. Thus, from August 2000 to August 2003, the Wife alone paid the monthly instalments of $1,837.90. From September 2003 onwards, however, when the instalments were increased, the Husband started to contribute to them. In February 2004, the Wife\u2019s CPF contributions decreased to $1,000.00 a month and the Husband thereafter correspondingly bore the remainder of each instalment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In February 2002, the parties entered into a sale and purchase agreement to purchase Malvern Springs in their joint names. The parties\u2019 intention <i>at that point in time</i> was for Malvern Springs to replace their matrimonial home, which was by then in a state of disrepair. Given that the Wife\u2019s funds were being used to finance the loan for the matrimonial home, the parties agreed that the Husband would be solely responsible for financing Malvern Springs. As the Husband was unable to obtain financing in his sole name, the parties also agreed that the mortgage loan for Malvern Springs was to be applied for in their joint names. The Husband made the initial 10% down payment for Malvern Springs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shortly afterwards, the parties\u2019 relationship broke down and when the time came to sign the mortgage documents, the Wife refused to sign them unless the Husband agreed to enter into a deed of financial settlement (\u201cthe Deed\u201d) with her to formally record an agreement with regard to Malvern Springs. Under the Deed, the Husband was to undertake to be solely responsible for all monthly instalments, the second 10% of the purchase price, interest, stamp duty, penalty, outgoings, costs, bank charges and fees and legal costs incurred in relation to Malvern Springs. The Husband did not consent to the Deed and as a result the Wife pulled out of the purchase in April 2003. Abortive costs of $10,684.04 were thus incurred.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Husband then proceeded to purchase Malvern Springs in his sole name in May 2003. The Wife had no knowledge of this until it was revealed in the Husband\u2019s fourth affidavit filed for the purposes of the ancillary matters in the divorce proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this juncture, it is important to note that the values of both properties have moved in opposite directions. While the matrimonial home has drastically decreased in value, Malvern Springs has appreciated in value. The matrimonial home was purchased for $688,000 but a valuation obtained by the Wife in June 2005 showed its then value to be only approximately $550,000. A shortfall will thus be incurred if the matrimonial home is to be sold now. On the other hand, Malvern Springs was purchased for $804,155 and, according to the Wife\u2019s estimate based on the sale price attained for a smaller unit at that time, was worth more than $1m in February 2005. The Husband disputed that estimate, but only as to the degree of capital appreciation, and not to the fact that no capital loss had been suffered in respect of Malvern Springs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Proceedings in the courts below</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the issue of division of matrimonial assets was first heard in the Family Court, the position of Malvern Springs was a hotly contested issue. The district judge considered that Malvern Springs should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided because the parties had intended it to replace their matrimonial home. The district judge made the following ancillary orders on 18\u00a0April 2005 (see <i>Chan Mei Lan Kristine v Ong Boon Huat Samuel</i> <nobr>[2005] SGDC 187</nobr> at [3]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The [Wife] was entitled to 18.56% of the net total value [<i>ie</i>, net profit of Malvern Springs \u2013 shortfall in the sale price of the matrimonial home \u2013 the Husband\u2019s cash loss \u2013 abortive costs of Malvern Springs] of both properties at 259, Onan Road (the matrimonial home) and 373,\u00a0Onan Road, #01-10 Malvern Springs (Malvern Springs property) which, using the [Husband\u2019s] amended calculations, amounted to $22,596.64.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The [Husband] was given the option either to sell the Malvern Springs property or he could retain it upon paying the [Wife] the said $22,596.64.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The matrimonial flat was to be sold within 6 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No order on other claims of both parties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [The Husband] to pay $1 per month as maintenance to [the Wife].</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs of Divorce Petition to [the Wife] fixed at $1,500 and costs of $2,000 for the ancillary proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Husband was dissatisfied and appealed against the orders made by the district judge. On appeal, the High Court judge reduced the Wife\u2019s share of the net total value of the two properties from 18.56% to 15% after taking into account the unsatisfactory state of the Husband\u2019s financial affairs. The High Court judge left the district judge\u2019s orders otherwise untouched.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>The parties\u2019 arguments and the findings of the lower courts</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not disputed that the matrimonial home was to be divided. The brunt of contention instead arose from the Wife\u2019s claim to a share in Malvern Springs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Husband\u2019s main argument in this court and the courts below was that Malvern Springs should <i>not</i> be included in the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided, <i>ie</i>, the Wife should not be entitled to any share in Malvern Springs. The main reason he gave was that the Wife had, from the very beginning, maintained that she was not interested in the purchase of Malvern Springs and that she should not be responsible for any liability that might arise from the same. That being so, she should not now be allowed to take advantage of the Husband\u2019s astute investment decision in purchasing Malvern Springs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Wife argued that Malvern Springs should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets because it was purchased during the marriage and was originally intended to replace the matrimonial home. Further, the parties\u2019 agreement was that the Wife would continue to service the monthly loan instalments in respect of the matrimonial home while the Husband financed the purchase of Malvern Springs. The Wife argued that it would be unjust and inequitable to now deny her a share of Malvern Springs because the arrangement resulted in her financing a negative asset (being the matrimonial home) while the Husband financed a profitable asset (being Malvern Springs).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The district judge and the High Court judge both agreed with the Wife. They found that Malvern Springs should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided because it was acquired during the marriage and was intended to constitute the parties\u2019 new matrimonial home. Further, the High Court judge found that the Husband could only afford to purchase Malvern Springs because the Wife was helping to finance the matrimonial home. She was, to that extent, financially strapped and unable to help finance Malvern Springs. The Wife had thus contributed to the purchase of Malvern Springs by relieving the Husband from the financial burden he would otherwise have borne with respect to the matrimonial home. The High Court judge concluded that she was therefore entitled to a share in Malvern Springs: see <i>Chan Mei Lan Kristine v Ong Boon Huat Samuel</i> <nobr>[2006] SGHC 108</nobr> (\u201cthe GD\u201d) at [16].</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Our decision</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Should Malvern Springs be included in the matrimonial asset pool?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having heard the submissions on appeal and having reconsidered the evidence, we have come to a different conclusion from the courts below. With respect, it is our determination that Malvern Springs should <i>not</i> be included in the matrimonial asset pool for division and consequently that the Wife should not get a share of Malvern Springs. This determination is, in our judgment, the only one that is consistent with the Wife\u2019s position from the beginning that she was to have no part in the purchase of Malvern Springs and all liabilities associated therewith would be borne by the Husband.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Wife\u2019s position <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> Malvern Springs was clearly enunciated in her affidavits. At para\u00a011 of her first affidavit filed on 10\u00a0November 2003, the Wife said:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i>The [Husband] was the one who wanted to buy this property.</i> I was already unable to afford buying another property as all my monies were already being used to finance our matrimonial home\u2019s outstanding loan. Therefore, it was agreed that the [Husband] would be the one fully financing the purchase of Malvern Springs. However, for the [Husband] to obtain a mortgage loan from the bank for such a purchase, the mortgage loan had to be applied for by both him and [me]. Therefore, the [Husband] asked me to be a joint owner of Malvern Springs and to apply for the mortgage loan with him so that he can continue with the purchase <i>but it was made very clear that I will not be paying anything for Malvern Springs.</i> This is confirmed by the fact that the [Husband] was the one who paid the initial 10% downpayment for the property. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She continued at para\u00a013:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The purchase of Malvern Springs was then aborted and I believe that the developers and the bank are seeking compensation and damages for the non-completion of the purchase. <i>I pray that the Court will order that any losses, damages, interest, payments are to be borne by the [Husband]</i> <i>as</i> <i>it was really his sole decision to buy Malvern Springs and he had agreed to finance it solely himself therefore I should not be liable for any of its losses or damages now</i>. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In her second affidavit filed on 5\u00a0December 2003, the Wife continued to protest that she should not be liable for the abortive costs associated with Malvern Springs. She said at para\u00a013:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I note that the [Husband] has made no mention of the Malvern Springs issue in his Affidavit but this is a matrimonial asset which should be divided during the divorce proceedings as well, even though it is in fact a liability now. <i>This liability should not be shared between the [Husband] and [me] but should be borne by him solely as this liability was not incurred for our joint benefit but for the [Husband\u2019s] sole benefit. It was his intention to invest his monies into this property and had nothing to do with me.</i> I was only to assist in obtaining a mortgage loan for him. <i>It was understood that this property would belong wholly to him. Therefore, the liability should also be his solely.</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notably, these affidavits were filed before the Wife found out that the Husband had purchased Malvern Springs in his own name. The Wife\u2019s subsequent affidavits made no reference to Malvern Springs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, it is evident that the Wife had from the beginning wholly dissociated herself from the purchase of Malvern Springs. She testified in her first affidavit (see [16] above) that the purchase of the property was the Husband\u2019s idea and she had only agreed to be a party to the mortgage because the Husband was unable to obtain financing in his sole name. At that time, the parties\u2019 relationship had already deteriorated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the parties\u2019 relationship had completely broken down, the Wife made her intentions exceptionally clear by seeking to enter into a legally binding agreement which would confirm that she would not be responsible for any liabilities arising from Malvern Springs. In a letter from the Wife\u2019s solicitors to the Husband\u2019s solicitors dated 4\u00a0April 2003 in which the Deed was proposed, it was made clear that the Wife would execute the mortgage documents to avoid both parties being sued by the developers of Malvern Springs, but only on the basis that the Husband would be solely responsible for the financial costs of the purchase and would indemnify her against any claims made in relation to that property. Her solicitors gave the Husband one day to accept these terms and, in the absence of such acceptance, the letter stated that the Wife would reserve her rights to seek an indemnity from the Husband for any losses, costs and damages sustained by her. When the Husband refused to enter into the Deed, the Wife put her intentions into effect by completely withdrawing from the purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Wife\u2019s second affidavit (see [18] above), filed before she found out that the Husband had purchased Malvern Springs in his sole name, is consistent with this view of the facts and is particularly telling. Importantly, she testified that the liability should be borne solely by the Husband because it was incurred \u201cfor the [Husband\u2019s] sole benefit\u201d and that the parties\u2019 understanding was for Malvern Springs to \u201cbelong wholly to [the Husband]\u201d.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having realised that the Husband had gone ahead with the purchase of Malvern Springs on his own, and that Malvern Springs had turned out to be a profitable investment, the Wife adopted a radically different position in these proceedings and claimed a share of Malvern Springs. We have no doubt that, had Malvern Springs turned out to be an imprudent investment, the Wife would have maintained her position that she should have nothing to do with the purchase. In our view, the Wife cannot now claim what she once rejected. If the Wife maintains that she has nothing to do with the liabilities associated with Malvern Springs, then she similarly can have no share in its profits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the facts, the Husband went ahead to purchase Malvern Springs in his sole name because he was facing substantial financial loss and was in danger of being sued by the developers if the initial purchase was aborted. Importantly, the purchase took place at a point in time when the parties\u2019 marriage had already completely broken down. To recall, the Husband purchased Malvern Springs in May 2003 and the Wife filed the second divorce petition shortly afterwards in July 2003. The Husband paid for both the first 10% down payment and the second 10% instalment of the purchase price from his cash savings, and has been paying the monthly loan instalments ever since.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of all the circumstances, we see no reason why Malvern Springs should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided between the parties. While it may be that Malvern Springs was acquired <i>during</i> the marriage, and therefore technically falls under the definition of a matrimonial asset contained in s\u00a0112(10) of the Act, we must emphasise that the court\u2019s power to divide any matrimonial asset is a discretionary power. This is obvious from ss\u00a0112(1) and 112(2) of the Act, which provide:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of <i>any matrimonial asset</i> or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It shall be the duty of the court <i>in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection\u00a0(1)</i> and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, it is not mandatory for the court to exercise its powers of division under s\u00a0112 and the court may generally decline to do so where a valid reason is given: <i>Wong Kam Fong Anne v Ang Ann Liang</i> <nobr>[1993] 2 SLR 192</nobr> at 200, [31]. For the reasons given above, the present case is one in which there is good reason for the court <i>not</i> to divide Malvern Springs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would also add that, while it may have been the intention of the parties in February 2002 that Malvern Springs should replace their matrimonial home, it was very clear that by May 2003, when the Husband purchased Malvern Springs in his sole name, such an intention no longer existed. In this regard, we must disagree with the approach of the lower courts in placing emphasis on the parties\u2019 original intention that Malvern Springs should become the new matrimonial home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Division of the matrimonial home</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having excluded Malvern Springs from division, we now turn to consider the division of the matrimonial home. In a short and childless marriage, the division of matrimonial assets will usually be in accordance with the parties\u2019 direct financial contributions as non-financial contributions will be minimal. Thus, in <i>Wang Shi Huah Karen v Wong King Cheung Kevin</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 1025</nobr>, a case where the wife left home after a year, the High Court divided the matrimonial home solely in accordance with the parties\u2019 direct financial contributions. In the present case, it has been established that the direct financial contributions of the parties to the matrimonial home are in the proportions of 64:36 from the Husband and the Wife respectively. The Wife rightly did not make a claim for any non-financial contributions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As stated above at [8], the matrimonial home has drastically decreased in value. On the basis of the figures we were given, the shortfall that will be incurred if the property is to be sold for $550,000 is approximately $70,000 (after refunding the parties\u2019 respective CPF contributions and repayment of the bank loan). It should be noted that the Husband had also obtained a lower valuation of $500,000 and if the property achieves a price closer to that value then the shortfall would be even larger. Further, as the CPF has a first charge on the property, the parties\u2019 CPF contributions will have to be refunded in priority to the bank loan. This means that the parties are liable to be sued by the bank for the shortfall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The matrimonial home is presently in a bad state of disrepair and is infested with termites. It is currently unoccupied. We were informed by the Husband during the hearing that the approximate cost of repairing the property is $20,000 but no evidence was given in support of this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The order made by the courts below was that the matrimonial home should be sold within six months (see [9] above). The Wife continued to press for an early sale whilst the Husband asked for a postponement. We are of the view that in the particular circumstances of this case, an immediate sale of the matrimonial home would be inequitable. As the parties\u2019 CPF contributions will first have to be refunded, the Wife will get a <i>full</i> refund of her direct financial contributions. On the other hand, the Husband stands to lose his entire cash down payment of $137,600. Indeed, the district judge made similar observations at [32] of his grounds of decision. In addition, given that the Wife is now residing in the UK, the Husband is, effectively, the borrower who will, at least in the immediate future, have to shoulder the full burden of paying the bank the amount of the shortfall or face being sued by it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It therefore appears to us that the equitable thing to do would be to allow a postponement of the sale of the matrimonial home for a limited period to give him the chance of selling it at a higher price. In the meantime, the matrimonial home can be rented out and the rent received can be used to defray the cost of repairs and to pay the loan instalments. It would, however, only be fair to grant the Husband\u2019s prayer for a postponement for the sale if the Wife\u2019s liability is not increased thereby. Therefore, for the period that the matrimonial home remains unsold the Husband must bear, solely, all the expenses relating to it including the loan instalments, service charge and property tax (though he may recoup these from the rental proceeds, if any) and such payments by him shall not affect the proportions in which the parties own the property, namely, 64% to the Husband and 36% to the Wife (see [28] above).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">33 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, we make the following orders with regards to the matrimonial home:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Husband shall be entitled to hold on to the matrimonial home for a period of up to three years from the date of the making of this order. During that period the Husband may, but shall not be obliged to, sell the matrimonial home. In the event the Husband decides to exercise his right of sale, he should give the Wife at least four weeks\u2019 notice of the completion of the sale. Should the Wife fail to execute all documents necessary to effect the transfer within four weeks from receiving such notice, the Registrar of the Supreme Court shall be empowered to execute the sale documents in the Wife\u2019s stead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the Husband does not sell the matrimonial home by the expiration of three years from the date of the making of this order, the Wife shall be entitled to effect the sale. Similarly, she should give the Husband at least four weeks\u2019 notice. Should the Husband fail to execute the necessary documents to effect the transfer within four weeks from receiving such notice, the Registrar of the Supreme Court shall be empowered to execute the necessary documents to effect the sale in the Husband\u2019s stead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Husband shall bear the monthly loan instalments and all other expenses associated with the matrimonial home until such time as the property is sold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the sale of the matrimonial home, the net proceeds of sale are to be divided between the Husband and the Wife in the proportions of 64:36 respectively after deduction of the following:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the refunds to both parties\u2019 CPF accounts of all moneys utilised for the acquisition of the matrimonial home together with accrued interest;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the sum paid to settle the outstanding bank loan;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Husband\u2019s cash contribution towards the initial down payment of $137,600.00 and stamp fees of $10,668.00 amounting to a total of $148,268.00;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the costs of repair works carried out to the extent that these have not already been recovered from any rental proceeds collected; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(v)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the costs of sale including legal costs and housing agent\u2019s commission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">On completion of the sale, the Husband shall render to the Wife an account of the manner in which the sale proceeds and the rental proceeds, if any, have been applied and shall pay the Wife her proportionate share of any moneys that remain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a loss is incurred upon sale, the loss is to be apportioned between the Husband and the Wife in the proportions 64:36 respectively. The Husband shall, if necessary, be entitled to recover from the Wife, as a debt due and payable to him, any amount which he has paid towards discharging the loan that is in excess of the amount which the bank would have been able to recover from him had it held him responsible for only 64% of the total outstanding amount, inclusive of interest, payable to it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both parties shall have liberty to apply to the High Court, if necessary, in connection with the implementation of these orders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Should the Wife be allowed a share in the Husband\u2019s savings for indirectly contributing to them?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would like to address one final point. It appears that the courts below were strongly influenced by the consideration that, by paying the full amount of the monthly loan instalments for the matrimonial home, the Wife had indirectly contributed to the Husband\u2019s ability to finance Malvern Springs. They concluded that this conduct entitled her to a share in Malvern Springs. Thus, the High Court judge observed at [16] of the GD:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In <i>substance</i>, however, the understanding between the parties never included any participation at all. But this did not mean that the Wife had relinquished her interest in the Malvern Springs property \u2013 or any of the matrimonial assets for that matter. It was a simple matter of division of financial labour, so to speak. <b><i>Her contribution, in fact, to the purchase of the Malvern Springs property was in the form of relieving the Husband with respect to his otherwise heavier financial burdens</i> vis-\u00e0-vis <i>the matrimonial home.</i></b> [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have already given our reasons above why the Wife should not be entitled to a share in Malvern Springs. The question remains: Should this court on the other hand treat the Husband\u2019s savings accumulated after the purchase of the matrimonial home, which he used to partly finance Malvern Springs, as a matrimonial asset that should be divided between the parties?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are of the view that the Wife should not get an additional sum on top of her direct financial contributions for two reasons. Firstly, the monthly loan instalments paid by the Wife constituted direct financial contributions and went towards increasing her percentage share in the matrimonial home in the event of a divorce. To allow her a sum in addition to her direct financial contributions would be giving her an unnecessary bonus. It is indeed unfortunate that the matrimonial home has depreciated in value, but this should not be a relevant factor for the court to take into account especially when it divides matrimonial assets in accordance with direct financial contributions. It is also relevant to note that all these contributions came from her CPF account and therefore even if the property is sold at a loss, her contributions will be returned to her in full together with accrued interest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, allowing the Wife an additional sum would, in our view, be contrary to the parties\u2019 original financial agreement. Let us relook the terms of this arrangement. When the matrimonial home was purchased, the Husband paid a large initial cash down payment of $137,600.00 from his savings. He additionally exhausted his CPF savings by making a lump sum payment of $74,740.46. Therefore, the most probable reason for the parties agreeing that the Wife should be responsible for the monthly loan instalments was simply that the Husband had exhausted the bulk of his cash savings and his entire CPF savings. Notably, this arrangement subsisted long before the purchase of Malvern Springs was contemplated. The basic point is that the parties would probably have continued this financial arrangement <i>even if Malvern Springs had not been purchased</i>. Simply put, this appears to be the crux of their arrangement \u2013 in so far as the matrimonial home was concerned, the Husband would make a large initial down payment and the Wife would pay the monthly instalments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This being so, we are unable to agree with the High Court judge\u2019s observations reproduced at [34] above. In the first place, the parties\u2019 financial arrangement never envisaged that the Husband should bear the financial burdens of contributing to the matrimonial home in so far as the monthly instalments were concerned. This being so, we find it somewhat artificial to say that the Wife had, by her contributions, relieved the Husband of his financial burdens <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> the matrimonial home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any case, there was no evidence before us that the Wife had claimed an entitlement to the Husband\u2019s savings as a matrimonial asset. The only ancillary matters heard in the lower courts were with regards to maintenance and the division of the matrimonial home and Malvern Springs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the reasons given above, we allow the appeal and set aside the orders made below in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. They shall be replaced by the orders set out in [33] above. The Husband shall be entitled to his costs of the appeal before the High Court judge, to be taxed if not agreed. As regards the costs of this appeal, as the Husband appeared in person he is not entitled to legal costs but he shall be entitled to recover reasonable disbursements in relation to this appeal. The security deposit shall be refunded to him.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\3\\B\\URJ_[2001]_SGCA_48_v2.0.html\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"6337\" id=\"6337-M\" uniqueid=\"8e62e2b4-6995-44ca-ab52-3097cdd616fa\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/6337-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2003-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2001-06-22T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2001</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>48</No>\n      <NCit>[2001] SGCA 48</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>48</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2001] SGCA 48</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng</SortTitle><SortDate>2001-06-22T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA 141/2000</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Plaintiff</Role>\n        <Name>Lim Choon Lai</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#2\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Defendant</Role>\n        <Name>Chew Kim Heng</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#7\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third Party</Role>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#254\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Lai Kew Chai J</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#539\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L P Thean JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#627\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Yong Pung How CJ</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Tan Kok Heng Leroy Solomon (Lee &amp; Lee) for the appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Raymond Lye and Alvin Chang (Tay Lye &amp; Ngaw Partnership) for the respondent</Counsel>\n    </Counsels>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2105\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Family Law</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2147\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Divorce</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Division of matrimonial home</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Just and equitable division</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"6\">Proper approach to making just and equitable division</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"7\">Financial and non-financial contributions by each party</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"8\">Wife making comparatively larger contributions to family and marriage</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n  \n\n<SLR>YES</SLR></Metadata>\n</CaseReport>\n<body>\n    <p align=\"justify\">\n      <font face=\"Times New Roman\" color=\"#3322AA\" size=\"4\">\n        <strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>\n      </font>\n    </p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\" color=\"#804040\">Grounds\n\nof Judgment</font></strong></p>\n\n<font face=\"Times New Roman\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\">1. This was an appeal from the decision of the High Court dismissing an\n\nappeal from the District Court on the issue of division of matrimonial assets following\n\nthe dissolution of the marriage between the appellant and the respondent. We allowed the\n\nappeal and now give our reasons.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Background facts</p>\n\n</b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">2. The appellant, Mdm Lim Choon Lai (\u2018Mdm Lim\u2019) and the\n\nrespondent, Mr Chew Kim Heng (\u2018Mr Chew\u2019) had had a long marriage of about 30\n\nyears. Unfortunately, their marriage was dissolved on 20 April 1999 on Mdm Lim\u2019s\n\npetition and Mr Chew\u2019s cross-petition on the ground that the marriage had\n\nirretrievably broken down.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">3. The parties had had a long relationship even before their marriage.\n\nThey first started living together as from December 1962, when Mdm Lim was still a\n\nstudent. She went on to pursue her university education and graduated in 1968. They\n\neventually got married in 1970. At the time of their marriage, both were employed in the\n\nGovernment service, Mr Chew as a clerk and Mdm Lim as a school teacher. He had been\n\nworking as a clerk since 1958 and retired on 1 May 1998. She, on the other hand, started\n\nwork in 1968 and continues to be so employed today. The parties have a daughter and a son\n\nfrom the marriage, and both of them are over 21 years old.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">4. With regard to the parties\u2019 housing arrangements during the 38\n\nyears that they were together, they first stayed at Mr Chew\u2019s family home for the\n\nperiod from 1963 to 1970. In 1972, they rented a place at 9A Clover Avenue. Soon\n\nthereafter and in the same year, they rented a flat at Block 60, Commonwealth Drive from\n\nthe Housing and Development Board (\u2018HDB\u2019). They stayed there until they bought\n\ntheir own flat in 1974. The new flat was at Block 8, Holland Avenue (\u2018the Holland\n\nAvenue flat\u2019), and it was purchased in their joint names from the HDB in early 1974\n\nfor $15,500. The downpayment and monthly instalments were paid for out of Mdm Lim\u2019s\n\nCentral Provident Fund (\u2018CPF\u2019), while Mr Chew paid for the furnishings and\n\nrenovations and was responsible for the other household expenses. The Holland Avenue flat\n\nwas later sold in November 1979 for $30,273, and they purchased the present matrimonial\n\nproperty, 83 Namly Avenue, Singapore (\u201883 Namly Avenue\u2019), which is a two-storey\n\nsemi-detached house. The total purchase price of the house, including renovations and\n\nother expenses, amounted to $229,000. A government loan of $90,000 was taken to finance\n\nthe purchase of the house, while the remaining sum of $139,000 was paid for directly by\n\nthe parties.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Proceedings below</p>\n\n</b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">5. With respect to the ancillary matters in the divorce proceedings\n\nbefore the District Court, the only contentious issue was the division of the matrimonial\n\nproperty, 83 Namly Avenue. The district judge made the following orders on 19 July 2000:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) That the matrimonial property known as 83 Namly Avenue, Singapore,\n\n  be sold in the open market within six months from the date of this order and the proceeds\n\n  of sale, less the expenses connected with the sale, be divided equally between the\n\n  parties.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(ii) That the wife be given the first option, to be exercised within\n\n  one month, to purchase the husband\u2019s share.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(iii) No order as to maintenance.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(iv) No order as to costs.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">6. Mdm Lim appealed only against the order relating to the division of\n\nthe matrimonial property. The High Court dismissed her appeal and she appealed to this\n\nCourt.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The appeal</p>\n\n</b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">7. The starting point in our consideration of this appeal is s 112 of\n\nthe Women\u2019s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 ed). Sub-section (1) thereof confers on the court\n\nthe power to order a division of matrimonial assets, and it provides:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the\n\n  grant of a decree of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the\n\n  division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and\n\n  the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such\n\n  proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Sub-section (2) of s 112 goes on to provide that the court, in deciding\n\non the question of division, must \u2018have regard to all the circumstances of the\n\ncase\u2019 and in particular, a number of matters there enumerated. It would be helpful to\n\nset out, in so far as material, these provisions which are as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise\n\n  its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the\n\n  circumstances of the case, including the following matters:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money,\n\n    property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(b) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party\n\n    for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(c) \u2026..</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare\n\n    of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or\n\n    infirm relative or dependant of either party;</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(e) \u2026..</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(f) \u2026..</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(g) the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party\n\n    (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which\n\n    aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(h) \u2026..</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">8. The central issue in this appeal was whether the division of the\n\nmatrimonial property, 83 Namly Avenue, between the parties was in a proportion which was\n\n\u2018just and equitable\u2019. The approach to be taken in determining what is a\n\n\u2018just and equitable\u2019 division of matrimonial assets has been considered in a\n\nnumber of High Court decisions. In <i>Soh Chan Soon v Tan Choon Yock </i>(DCA 5017/97, 19\n\nJune 1998, unreported), Warren Khoo J advocated the use of a presumption of equal\n\ncontribution as the starting point. He held, at  4, 9 &amp; 10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">4. Division of matrimonial assets is not a science. It is a judicial\n\n  attempt to divide what was never intended to be divided in the first place. The\n\n  legislature and the courts have formulated general guidelines, but it is possible for two\n\n  judges each doing his or her honest best to come to two significantly different results.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\u2026</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">9. There is a touch of artificiality in such cases to use as the\n\n  starting point in a division of the matrimonial assets the amount of money each party has\n\n  contributed directly towards the acquisition of the home. This ignores the indirect\n\n  contributions, monetary and otherwise, most of which are incapable of any meaningful\n\n  ascertainment either because no record was kept or because the nature of the contribution\n\n  is irreducible into monetary terms. It is closer to reality to use as the starting point\n\n  the assumption that both parties have contributed jointly and equally throughout the\n\n  marriage to the acquisition and growth of the equity in the family home. An account can\n\n  then be taken of other factors to tilt the balance one way or the other. It is more a\n\n  qualitative than a quantitative exercise.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">10. Working out the exact amounts of direct monetary contribution would\n\n  be worthwhile only in a case, e.g. of a couple who has been married for a short time, with\n\n  no children, each with independent means and who have not shared a household and its\n\n  myriad responsibilities. It is hardly worthwhile in the vast majority of cases that come\n\n  through the divorce courts. It also sometimes adds to the acrimony in ancillary\n\n  proceedings, not to say anything about the costs of them.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">9. In that case, the marriage lasted for about 28 years, and throughout\n\nthe marriage the wife played a large role in maintaining the family. She even paid the\n\ndebts of the husband. In terms of the financial contributions made to the purchase of the\n\nmatrimonial flat, the wife contributed 34%, while the husband paid the balance of 66%.\n\nAfter taking into account the significant indirect contributions made by the wife, the\n\ndistrict court awarded the wife a 63% share in the flat. The husband appealed and his\n\nappeal was dismissed by Warren Khoo J.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">10. In <i>Louis Pius Gilbert v Louis Anne Lise </i><a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49757&amp;freetext=\">[2000] 1 SLR 274</a>,\n\nparties were married on 11 July 1980 and their marriage lasted for about 18 years. The\n\nmatrimonial assets for division between them comprised mainly a HDB flat and the\n\nhusband\u2019s CPF savings. The wife\u2019s contributions were, for the most part,\n\nindirect and the district judge awarded her 35% of the value of the assets. In upholding\n\nthe district judge\u2019s decision, Goh Joon Seng J endorsed the approach taken by Warren\n\nKhoo J in <i>Soh Chan Soon v Tan Choon Yock</i>, and held that the district judge\u2019s\n\ndecision was not shown to be so out of line as to be perverse or that it was clearly wrong\n\non principle.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">11. A slightly different approach was, however, taken in <i>Lau Loon\n\nSeng v Sia Peck Eng</i> [1999] 4 SLR 409, where the High Court was again dealing with a\n\nlong marriage \u2013 a marriage of about 41 years. The wife was a housewife, who looked\n\nafter the family and also helped the husband in his business. The district court gave the\n\nwife a 50% share in the matrimonial assets, but on appeal, the High Court varied the order\n\nand reduced the wife\u2019s entitlement to only 30%. Kan Ting Chiu J held that the\n\ndistrict judge had placed a greater value on the wife\u2019s input than she had done so\n\nherself. He referred to what he considered the genesis of s 112 of the Women\u2019s\n\nCharter, which replaced the previous s 106, and held that the principle of equal division\n\nwas not preserved in the \u2018just and equitable\u2019 formulation, and what was just and\n\nequitable must be decided on the facts of each case. The case of <i>Soh Chan Soon v Tan\n\nChoon Yock</i>, however,<i> </i>was not cited to the judge and was therefore not\n\nconsidered.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">12. There are two further High Court decisions on the division of\n\nmatrimonial assets, both of which were decided by Judith Prakash J. In the first case, <i>Yow\n\nMee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59755&amp;freetext=\">[2000] 4 SLR 466</a>, the parties were married for 26 years and\n\nhad three children from ages 12 to 24. The wife played a supporting role in the family\n\nbusiness but made less financial contributions than the husband. However, she was the main\n\ncaregiver of the children and she looked after the family. The district judge awarded the\n\nwife 50% of the matrimonial home, 40% of the husband\u2019s Singapore assets, and 30% of\n\nhis foreign assets. Both parties appealed against this decision. Judith Prakash J held\n\nthat the wife should be given 50% of all the assets. In discussing the principles\n\napplicable to the question of division of matrimonial assets, she disagreed with the\n\napproach taken in <i>Soh Chan Soon</i> that the starting point is the assumption that both\n\nparties have contributed jointly and equally throughout the marriage to the matrimonial\n\nassets. She felt that such an approach placed too much emphasis on financial contributions\n\ntowards the acquisition of matrimonial assets and gave too little weight to other\n\ncontributions made to the marriage. She was of the view that the court should instead\n\nfirst determine the facts of any particular case, consider which of the factors set out in\n\ns 112(2) of Women\u2019s Charter are applicable on those facts, and thereafter decide, on\n\nthat basis, what would amount to an equitable division. She said at <font face=\"Lucida Console\"/> 32 \u2013 33:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">32. \u2026 The court\u2019s task in each case now is to consider the\n\n  marriage before it as a whole and particularly the role played by each of the parties in\n\n  the physical and emotional care of the family and in their financial dealings, in order to\n\n  arrive, to the best of its ability, at a fair division of the assets. In doing this, the\n\n  court will of course have regard to the various factors laid down both in s 112(2) and in\n\n  s 114 but will not be bound to give pre-eminence to any of those factors in the way it\n\n  used to have to do under s 106(4). Thus, a party\u2019s financial contributions to the\n\n  acquisition of any particular matrimonial asset can no longer be principally determinative\n\n  of how it is divided and the court is free to give as much weight or more to other,\n\n  non-financial, factors.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">33. Given that the court\u2019s prime function is to make an equitable\n\n  distribution of matrimonial assets in the light of all the circumstances, it cannot carry\n\n  out this function properly if it operates on assumptions. In my view, the correct approach\n\n  would be to first determine the facts of any particular case, consider which of the\n\n  factors set out in s 112(2) are applicable on those facts and thereafter decide what on\n\n  that basis would amount to an equitable division. In this regard, I must respectfully\n\n  disagree with the approach postulated in <i>Soh Chan Soon</i>\u2019s case that the\n\n  starting point is the assumption that both parties have contributed jointly and equally\n\n  throughout the marriage to the acquisition and growth of the equity in the family home (an\n\n  assumption which in this case the court below applied equally to all other matrimonial\n\n  assets) and thereafter take account of the other factors mentioned in s 112(2) to tilt the\n\n  balance between them.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In particular, Prakash J emphasised that a party\u2019s financial\n\ncontributions to the acquisition of any particular matrimonial asset cannot be principally\n\ndeterminative of how it is divided and just as much weight or more can be given to other\n\nnon-financial factors. She held, at  43:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\u2026 marriage is not a business where, generally, parties receive an\n\n  economic reward commensurate with their economic input. It is a union in which the husband\n\n  and wife work together for their common good and the good of their children. Each of them\n\n  uses (or should use) his or her abilities and efforts for the welfare of the family and\n\n  contributes whatever he or she is able to. The partners often have unequal abilities\n\n  whether as parents or as income earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and\n\n  talent should not result in unequal rewards where the contributions are made consistently\n\n  and over a long period of time.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">13. In the second case of <i>Neil John Ryan v Rosaline Berger </i><a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=60356&amp;freetext=\">[2001] 1 SLR 419</a>, Prakash J reiterated her view that a just and equitable division should not be\n\nequated with an equal division, although she did conclude that in that particular case, an\n\nequal division was just and equitable. She said at <font face=\"Lucida Console\"/>\n\n32:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">32. Having considered the submissions and the facts, I concur with the\n\n  judge\u2019s conclusion that in this case the just and equitable division of the\n\n  matrimonial assets was an equal one. I do not think that the judge did equate a just and\n\n  equitable division with an equal division. I agree with the submission that the two are\n\n  not the same because just and equitable has to be determined on the basis of the facts\n\n  before the Court in any proceeding and whilst in one situation it might be just and\n\n  equitable to divide assets equally between the parties, in another situation such a\n\n  decision might very well wreak injustice.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Later in relation to the facts of the case, she said at <font face=\"Lucida Console\"/>34:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">34. In this particular case, therefore, on the basis of the factors\n\n  cited by the judge, viz the length of the marriage, the parties\u2019 joint involvement in\n\n  the family business up to 1990, the wife\u2019s contributions in the domestic sphere and\n\n  as a mother thereafter and the wife\u2019s efforts to maintain or improve the value of the\n\n  family\u2019s assets by property investment vis--vis the husband\u2019s role in running\n\n  the main income producing asset ie the company after 1990, it was just and it was\n\n  equitable to order an equal division of all matrimonial assets.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">14. In our respectful view, the approach adopted by Judith Prakash J in\n\n<i>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59755&amp;freetext=\">[2000] 4 SLR 466</a> is correct. In determining a\n\n\u2018just and equitable\u2019 division of matrimonial assets under s 112(1) of the\n\nWomen\u2019s Charter, the court must, as directed by s 112(2), have regard to all the\n\nrelevant circumstances of the case at hand, and in particular the matters enumerated in\n\nthat sub-section, in so far as they are applicable, and on that basis determine what a\n\n\u2018just and equitable\u2019, division should be. The matters enumerated there comprise\n\nboth financial and non-financial contributions made by the parties. Where financial\n\ncontributions are concerned, the court must, of course, take into account the sums\n\ncontributed by each party; these are the matters specifically mentioned in paragraphs (a)\n\nand (b) of s\u00a0112(2). However, this does not mean that the court should engage in a\n\nmeticulous investigation and take an account of every minute sum each party has paid or\n\nincurred in the acquisition of the matrimonial assets and/or discharge of any obligation\n\nfor the benefit of any member of the family, and then make exact calculations of each\n\nparty\u2019s contributions. The court must necessarily take a broader view than that. As\n\nfor the non-financial contributions, they also play an important role, and depending on\n\nthe circumstances of the case, they can be just as important. At the end of the day,\n\ntaking into account both the financial and non-financial contributions, the court would\n\nadopt a broad-brush approach to the issue and make a determination on the basis of what\n\nthe court considers as a \u2018just and equitable\u2019 division.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">15. It is true that a division of matrimonial assets under s 112(1) of\n\nthe Act is not an exact science, and that each judge would have his own view in a\n\nparticular case as to what is a just and equitable division. It all depends on the facts\n\nof the case before him. That is what is directed by that section. Bearing in mind what the\n\nsection directs, the judge in any particular case is doing the best he can in making a\n\ndivision of the assets between the husband and wife. Such an exercise, in principle, is\n\nanalogous to that of assessment of damages or losses, which a judge does frequently.\n\nHaving regard to what the court is statutorily directed to do, we do not think, with\n\nrespect, that it is correct to say that \u2018it is closer to reality to use as the\n\nstarting point the assumption that both husband and wife have contributed jointly and\n\nequally throughout the marriage to the acquisition and growth of the equity in the family\n\nhome\u2019, whether the marriage be a long or a short one. The proper approach should be\n\nto have regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular those set out in s\n\n112(2) and make a division on the basis of what the court considers is a \u2018just and\n\nequitable\u2019 division between the parties.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Direct contributions</p>\n\n</b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">16. We now turn to the facts in this case. It was undisputed that the\n\npurchase price of 83 Namly Avenue was $229,000 and that a loan of $90,000 was taken to\n\nfinance the purchase, which was to be repaid over 18 years with each party making equal\n\ncontributions of $316.50 per month. The loan had since been fully repaid and there was no\n\noutstanding mortgage over the property. What was really in contention between the parties\n\nbefore us and also below was the extent of each party\u2019s contributions to the balance\n\nsum of $139,000.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">17. Mr Chew claimed that he paid $125,000 as direct financial\n\ncontributions to the purchase price of 83 Namly Avenue. A sum of $100,000 was his savings\n\nfrom his salary earned during the period from 1958 to 1979, $16,054 from his MPF benefits\n\nand $9,000 from his share of the compensation paid by the government for the acquisition\n\nof his family home at Lorong Tamok. Mdm Lim conceded that he paid only the sum of $22,768\n\naltogether: being $16,054 from his MPF and $6,714 from the government compensation, but\n\ndisputed that he paid the $100,000 from his alleged accumulated savings. It seemed to us\n\nthat Mr Chew\u2019s claim on the amount of his salary savings was exaggerated. His income\n\nfor the 10-year period from 1970 to 1979 was only about $68,000. Having regard to the kind\n\nof job in which he was employed, he could not have earned more than that amount for the\n\nearlier 10-year period from 1958 to 1969. On that basis, his income would be about\n\n$136,000 or less for the period of 20 years from 1958 to 1979. In order to have\n\naccumulated savings of $100,000 over that same period, Mr Chew would have had to spend\n\nless than $36,000 in the 20 years, which would be less than $150 per month. This was\n\nhighly improbable when he also claimed to have helped out with the household expenses,\n\npaying for the taxes and other charges.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">18. Mdm Lim, on the other hand, claimed that she paid $107,047 as her\n\ndirect contribution for the purchase of 83 Namly Avenue. This was made up of $76,774 from\n\nher accumulated savings from her salary and other sources of income, and $30,273 from the\n\nsale proceeds of the Holland Avenue flat. Mdm Lim said that during the 10-year period from\n\n1970 to 1980, her total income was $116,885, which was almost double that of Mr Chew for\n\nthe same period. It was therefore submitted that she must have made more contributions to\n\nthe purchase price. In our view, her claim was similarly inflated. Firstly, the actual\n\nnett proceeds arising from the sale of the Holland Avenue flat was only $6,995 and not\n\n$30,273, and of this $6,995, half belonged to Mr Chew. Having regard to this, if she\n\ncontributed the sum of $107,047, it could only have come from her savings, which would not\n\nhave been possible with her level of income at that time, especially if her assertion that\n\nshe had paid for most of the household expenses was to be believed.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">19. The district judge found that both parties were not able to\n\nsubstantiate their respective claims and that they each exaggerated the extent of their\n\nown contributions. The district judge accepted that Mr Chew had contributed $22,768, as\n\nconceded by Mdm Lim. She found that $6,995 came from the sale of the Holland Avenue flat.\n\nIn her view, Mdm Lim should not be given the sole credit for this sum of $6,995, even\n\nthough she had used her CPF monies to pay for the flat, as credit had to be given to Mr\n\nChew\u2019s contributions towards the renovations and household expenses. The district\n\njudge felt that it would be futile to go into a minute examination of each party\u2019s\n\nexact contributions, especially since the sale of the Holland Avenue flat took place 20\n\nyears ago, and she thus concluded that they should be entitled to the profit from the sale\n\nof the flat in equal shares, i.e. each being entitled to $3,497.50.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">20. On the basis that Mr Chew had contributed $22,768 and that $6,995\n\nhad come from the sale of the Holland Avenue flat, the district judge held that only the\n\npayment for the balance of $109,237 was in dispute. In the face of conflicting evidence\n\nfrom both parties, she did not make a finding as to how much each party paid exactly. She\n\ntook into account the fact that Mr Chew had started working 10 years earlier than Mdm Lim\n\nand would have accumulated more savings even though Mdm Lim was earning a higher salary\n\nthan he was. She found that, at best, each had contributed equally from their savings. On\n\nthis basis, she held that with regard to the purchase of 83 Namly Avenue, Mr Chew\u2019s\n\ndirect financial contribution was 58% while Mdm Lim\u2019s was 42%. On appeal, the High\n\nCourt upheld the district judge\u2019s assessment but noted that the correct calculations\n\nof the percentage contributions should instead be 55% and 45% respectively.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">21. We were in agreement with the district judge\u2019s decision that\n\nthe nett proceeds from the sale of the Holland Avenue flat should be split equally between\n\nthe parties. Although the flat was substantially paid for from monies from Mdm Lim\u2019s\n\nCPF account, all those monies, presumably with interest, had been refunded to her CPF\n\naccount upon the sale of the flat. Having had the benefit of this repayment, it follows\n\nthat she should not be entitled to the whole of the nett proceeds of sale. Further, it\n\nappeared that Mr Chew had also made financial contributions by paying for the furnishings\n\nand renovations and various household expenses. This was admitted by Mdm Lim.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">22. We now turn to the balance of $109,237, which was in dispute. The\n\nevidence from the respective parties was conflicting and neither of them was able to prove\n\nwhat were his or her exact contributions. It was not in dispute that in the relevant\n\n10-year period from 1970 to 1980, Mdm Lim earned almost twice the amount earned by Mr\n\nChew. From that alone, it seemed that she was in a much better financial position than Mr\n\nChew and probably had made larger contributions towards the purchase price. The district\n\njudge was of the view that Mdm Lim\u2019s higher earning power was counter-balanced by the\n\nfact that Mr Chew had been working for 10 years more than Mdm Lim and would have had more\n\nsavings than Mdm Lim by 1979. We had grave doubts on this evaluation. We did not think\n\nthat Mr Chew would necessarily have had more savings at the end of the period simply\n\nbecause he had a head-start over Mdm Lim, since his earnings then were rather low and,\n\nmore likely than not, he would have spent most or all of it on the family. It seemed to us\n\nthat the higher earnings of Mdm Lim during the relevant period would probably result in\n\nhigher contributions by her which would offset the $22,768 as the contribution of Mr Chew.\n\nBearing in mind the absence of reliable evidence on the exact monetary contributions made\n\nby each party with regard to the purchase, which took place more than 20 years ago, we\n\nthink that a fairer view would be that the parties made substantially equal contributions\n\ntowards the purchase of 83 Namly Avenue.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Other financial and non-financial contributions</p>\n\n</b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">23. Mdm Lim claimed that throughout the 30-year marriage, she was the\n\none who shouldered the bulk of the household expenses, did most of the housework and\n\nlooked after the welfare of the family. She highlighted repeatedly the fact that her\n\nearnings over that period were significantly higher than Mr Chew\u2019s and that she was\n\nthe one who was able to provide the family with a comfortable living by paying for their\n\noverseas holidays, purchases of cars and branded goods. By contrast, Mr Chew\u2019s meagre\n\nincome was not sufficient for him to provide much for the family at all.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">24. Mr Chew did not deny that he earned considerably less than Mdm Lim.\n\nIn fact, he said that it was precisely because they both recognised that Mdm Lim would\n\nhave better career prospects that they agreed upon the arrangement, whereby she would\n\nfocus on her career development, while he would be mainly responsible for the family. Mr\n\nChew said that as Mdm Lim was busier with her career, he was the one who did most of the\n\nhousework and he was the main caregiver of the children. In addition, he had made other\n\nfinancial contributions to the family by paying for the household expenses such as the\n\nutilities, taxes, telephone bills, family car, petrol and newspapers. He also paid for the\n\nrent and conservancy charges while they were staying in the rented homes as well as for\n\nthe furnishings and renovations for their Holland Avenue flat. Mr Chew said that he had\n\npaid for four years of the daughter\u2019s medical course at the university, and this came\n\nup to a sum of $48,000. During that period, he had further provided the daughter with a\n\nmonthly allowance of $600 per month. He claimed that the agreement with Mdm Lim was that\n\nhe would pay for the daughter\u2019s medical course, while she would pay for the\n\nson\u2019s engineering course. Mdm Lim disputed the amount that Mr Chew paid for the\n\ndaughter\u2019s medical course. She said that he paid only $36,000 for the course for the\n\nperiod from the second year to the fifth, whereas she was the one who paid for the first\n\nyear. She admitted that Mr Chew paid for some of the household expenses, but claimed that\n\nhis contributions were little due to his paltry income and that she was still the one who\n\npaid for the bulk of the expenses.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">25. In dealing with the issue of other financial contributions made by\n\nthe parties, the district judge\u2019s view was that it was not surprising for Mdm Lim to\n\nbear the bulk of the household expenses since she earned almost twice Mr Chew\u2019s\n\nincome. However, the judge also chose to give credit to Mr Chew for his payment of the\n\ndaughter\u2019s school fees. With respect to the indirect contributions, no findings were\n\nmade as to who was the primary caregiver of the children but the district judge appeared\n\nto have acknowledged Mdm Lim\u2019s role in running the household and bringing up the\n\nchildren.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">26. We had no doubt that in the course of the 30-year marriage, it was\n\nMdm Lim who bore the main burden of supporting the family and providing for its welfare.\n\nShe was a determined woman who had worked very hard for her family, and she strove to\n\nimprove herself in her career. She took on extra work and assignments, such as relief\n\nteaching and marking examination papers, in order to augment the family income. From the\n\navailable evidence, which was not disputed, it could be observed that by May 1996, Mdm\n\nLim\u2019s gross monthly income was about $5,000 while Mr Chew\u2019s was only about\n\n$1,800. Although the parties could not be said to be high income earners, the family was\n\nnonetheless able to enjoy a comfortable living. They bought cars and went on packaged\n\ntours overseas, and it was apparent that these material comforts were provided largely by\n\nMdm Lim. Of course, due recognition should also be given to Mr Chew for his contributions.\n\nHe did what his level of income permitted him to, and he paid for the lesser expenses. In\n\nour view, the district judge had been too generous towards Mr Chew and had given too much\n\ncredit to Mr Chew\u2019s financial contributions. Whilst he may have paid for part of his\n\ndaughter\u2019s university education, this could hardly be matched with the level of\n\nfinancial input which Mdm Lim had contributed to the welfare and maintenance of the\n\nfamily.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">27. As for the indirect contributions made by the parties, we believed\n\nthat Mdm Lim, being a school teacher, would most probably have had more time to spend with\n\nthe family and children, whereas Mr Chew, who worked as a clerk, would have had a nine to\n\nfive vocation and would not have been as likely to spare the time.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Conclusion</p>\n\n</b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">28. After taking into consideration all the various factors and\n\nweighing the contributions, both monetary and non-monetary, made by each party, we were of\n\nthe view that Mdm Lim deserved greater credit for the comparatively larger contributions\n\nshe had made to the family and marriage. Consequently, we held that a just and equitable\n\ndivision would be for Mdm Lim to receive a 60% share in the sale proceeds of 83 Namly\n\nAvenue and for Mr Chew to have a 40% share. In the result, we allowed Mdm Lim\u2019s\n\nappeal.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Sgd:</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Yong Pung How<br/>\n\nChief Justice</p>\n\n<p

<i>nisi</i> for divorce, to annul, pursuant to s\u00a073B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap\u00a061, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CLPA\u201d), the sale and transfer by the husband of a certain property at 764\u00a0Mountbatten Road (\u201cthe Mountbatten property\u201d) and some 60,000 shares in a family company to two related companies owned by members of his family. These two companies are the appellants herein. In the court below, Judith Prakash\u00a0J granted the relief prayed for, including an order for account of rental and profits (see <nobr>[2004] 4 SLR 365</nobr>). We heard the appeal on 21 and 24\u00a0February 2005 and reserved judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The background</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent, Mdm\u00a0Wong Ser Wan (\u201cMdm\u00a0Wong\u201d), married Mr\u00a0Ng Cheong Ling (\u201cMr\u00a0Ng\u201d) in January 1976. Mr\u00a0Ng is one of the sons of Mr\u00a0Ng Bok Beng (\u201cNBB\u201d), the founder of Ng Bok Eng Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cNBEH\u201d), the first appellant herein. NBEH was set up by NBB more than 30 years ago. At the time, the shareholders of NBEH were Mr\u00a0Ng and his parents and siblings. Its directors were NBB, Mr\u00a0Ng and his older brother, Ng Cheong Bian (\u201cNCB\u201d). By the time of the trial, Mr\u00a0Ng no longer held any shares in NBEH, having on 26\u00a0September 1998 transferred his entire shareholding therein, which stood at 60,000, to the second appellant, Bian Bee Company Pte Ltd (\u201cBBC\u201d). The shareholders of BBC were NBB and NCB.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0Ng and Mdm\u00a0Wong have three children. By the first half of the 1990s, their marriage was considerably strained. In 1995, Mdm\u00a0Wong applied for a summons in the Subordinate Courts against Mr\u00a0Ng claiming for maintenance for herself and the children. In March 1996, upon Mr\u00a0Ng promising to give her a monthly allowance of $12,000, Mdm\u00a0Wong withdrew the summons. However, Mr\u00a0Ng failed to keep to his promise. As a result, Mdm\u00a0Wong took out a fresh maintenance summons in July 1996 which was heard in August 1996 and, by consent, a monthly maintenance of $15,000 was ordered.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In October 1996, Mdm\u00a0Wong filed a petition for divorce on the ground of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s unreasonable behaviour involving an improper association with a named woman. Mr\u00a0Ng cross-petitioned for divorce on the ground of unreasonable behaviour on the part of Mdm\u00a0Wong.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 1997, attempts were made to save the marriage and/or to reach a settlement. By December 1997, an agreement was reached and signed between the parties on financial matters (\u201cthe Financial Agreement\u201d) under which Mr\u00a0Ng agreed to:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 give certain immovable properties to Mdm\u00a0Wong, including a property in Singapore;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pay Mdm\u00a0Wong two sums, one for $2.5m and the other for US$320,000. The US$320,000 was to be paid within seven banking days of the Agreement and $500,000 of the $2.5m within three months thereafter. As for the remainder of the $2.5m, $1m was to be paid by November 1998 and the last $1m by November 1999;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 continue to pay the consent maintenance of $15,000 per month;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 transfer certain shares to Mdm\u00a0Wong by 15\u00a0February 1998.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Both parties also agreed to withdraw the various divorce proceedings taken by them in court, with Mr\u00a0Ng to pay Mdm\u00a0Wong her legal costs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, Mr\u00a0Ng failed to fulfil the promises he made in the Financial Agreement as they fell due. Instead, on 12\u00a0June 1998, Mr\u00a0Ng entered into an agreement to sell the Mountbatten property (estimated to be worth $8m) to NBEH for US$2m and this transaction was completed on 27\u00a0June 1998. In the meantime, on 25\u00a0June 1998, Mr\u00a0Ng entered into another agreement to sell his 60,000 NBEH shares to BBC for US$1m and this sale was completed in September 1998. Hereinafter, the Mountbatten property and the 60,000 NBEH shares will be referred to collectively as \u201cthe two assets\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was disagreement as to the value of the Mountbatten property, with Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s valuer putting it at $5,420,000, with a forced sale value of $3,795,000. Mdm\u00a0Wong\u2019s valuer estimated it at $8.2m. However, Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s valuer\u2019s valuation could not be accepted by the trial judge because the valuer had made an error in categorising the Mountbatten property as a conservation property when it was not. Moreover, even on Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s valuer\u2019s assessment, the market price was $5,420,000, well in excess of the US$2m (equivalent to $3.5m) paid by NBEH. As regards the price of US$1m for the 60,000 NBEH shares, the judge found it difficult to determine whether that price was substantially less than the market price as NBEH is a private company.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the evidence, it is clear that there are different methods of valuation, <i>eg</i>, the dividend payment method and the asset value method. However, none of these are exact. More importantly, at the time the transfers were agreed to and effected, neither Mr\u00a0Ng nor the appellants had any regard to the real values of the two assets. All Mr\u00a0Ng wanted was to make the transfers look good and real.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the first half of 1999, following Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s failure to fulfil his promises under the Financial Agreement, further negotiations between the parties took place through their solicitors, culminating in the execution of a deed of separation on 8\u00a0July 1999. The deed of separation affirmed Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s obligations under the Financial Agreement. Accordingly, on 9\u00a0July 1999, Mdm\u00a0Wong withdrew her divorce petition filed in 1996.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In September and October 1999, Mdm\u00a0Wong, being anxious to ascertain what Mr\u00a0Ng was up to, took steps to secretly record some of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s conversations with a number of people. From these conversations, it was clear that Mr\u00a0Ng had planned to put his assets out of her reach. On 9\u00a0October 1999, Mdm\u00a0Wong filed a fresh divorce petition and in March 2000 obtained a Mareva injunction to restrain Mr\u00a0Ng from dissipating his assets. Mdm\u00a0Wong obtained a decree <i>nisi</i> for divorce on 1\u00a0August 2002. The decree <i>nisi</i> has yet to be made absolute.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the meantime in a separate action, in Suit No\u00a01396 of 2001, Mdm\u00a0Wong also commenced a derivative action on behalf of Aromate Pte Ltd (\u201cAromate\u201d) against Mr\u00a0Ng for his breach of fiduciary duty as a director of Aromate and obtained judgment against him for $3.8m and costs.

She further held that by virtue of the terms of the Financial Agreement, Mdm\u00a0Wong was a creditor of Mr\u00a0Ng who had acted dishonestly when he effected the transfers of the Mountbatten property and the 60,000 NBEH shares to the appellants, the object of which was to reduce the matrimonial assets to which Mdm\u00a0Wong would be entitled. The judge noted that while the appellants, NBEH and BBC, did pay for the assets transferred, namely, US$2m and US$1m for the property and the shares respectively, no attempts were made to determine their real values. As Mr\u00a0Ng was the controlling mind of both the appellants, the latter were affixed with the knowledge of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s intention to defraud Mdm\u00a0Wong. Accordingly, the judge held that the appellants did not obtain the two assets in good faith.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Meaning and scope of section\u00a073B of the CLPA</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Quah Kay Tee v Ong &amp; Co Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 390</nobr> (\u201c<i>Quah Kay Tee</i>\u201d) at [8] and [9], this court stated that s\u00a073B of the CLPA was derived from s\u00a0172 of the English Law of Property Act 1925 (c\u00a020), which in turn was based substantially on the Statute of Elizabeth 1571 (c\u00a05) (\u201cthe Elizabethan Statute\u201d), an Act against fraudulent deeds, gifts, alienations, <i>etc</i>. The court in <i>Quak Kay Tee</i> stated at [26] that the one great object of the Elizabethan Statute was to \u201cprevent debtors from dealing with their property in any way to the prejudice of their creditors\u201d. If the transfer was without any, or with only nominal, consideration, there would be a presumption of an intent to defraud on the part of the transferor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the nature of things, unless there is an admission, proof of an intent to defraud on the part of the transferor will invariably have to be inferred from all the circumstances. The position will be the same with regard to the question as to whether or not the transferee of the assets who has given valuable or good consideration has received the assets in good faith, without notice of the intent to defraud creditors on the part of the transferor. We agree with what Prakash\u00a0J said as to the elements that need to be proved to set aside a transaction or to bring a transaction outside the ambit of s\u00a073B (see [13] and [14] above).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Quah Kay Tee</i>, a voluntary transfer of shares in a private company from a debtor to another private company was held to fall foul of the Elizabethan Statute, which was the statute in force in Singapore prior to the enactment of s\u00a073B, because of constructive fraud.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast, in <i>Soh Lai Chan v Kuah Peng Hock</i> <nobr>[2003] SGHC 144</nobr> (\u201c<i>Soh Lai Chan</i>\u201d), a decision of the High Court which was affirmed by this court on appeal, a challenge by a former wife to her former husband\u2019s disposal of his assets made pursuant to some family arrangements failed. There, the former wife, while still a wife, together with members of the husband\u2019s family, had knowingly and willingly participated in a family arrangement, at the direction of the family patriarch, whereby all members of the family had transferred their assets among themselves on the same day. This family arrangement was effected about two years before there was any contemplation of divorce proceedings between the couple. There was no intent to defraud on the part of the husband. We would add that the situation in <i>Soh Lai Chan</i> was quite different from that of the present case. Here the scheme for the transfers of the two assets was hatched by Mr\u00a0Ng.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Issues on appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this appeal, three main issues are canvassed. First, the appellants argue that when Mr\u00a0Ng transferred the assets to them, there was no intention on his part to defraud his creditors. Second, they argue that even if the answer to the first issue is in the affirmative, the appellants had no notice of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s intent to defraud. Third, the appellants contend that the judge was wrong to have made an order to account.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Was there intent to defraud?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The contention of the appellants was that Mr\u00a0Ng entered into the agreement of 12\u00a0June 1998 to sell the Mountbatten property to NBEH and the agreement of 25\u00a0June 1998 to sell the 60,000 NBEH shares to BBC solely for the purpose of obtaining funds urgently needed to help two companies of his, namely, Aromate and Fustar Chemicals Ltd (\u201cFustar\u201d), to settle their debts owing to Standard Chartered Bank (\u201cStanchart\u201d) and United Overseas Bank (\u201cUOB\u201d) Hong Kong respectively. The appellants claimed that Mr\u00a0Ng was obliged to do that because he stood as guarantor for the debts of those two companies and thus the burden fell on him. Mr\u00a0Ng alleged that he had to obtain the funds very quickly. In effecting the transfer of the property and the shares to the appellants, the appellants averred that Mr\u00a0Ng had obtained valuable consideration. The appellants also claimed that as Mr\u00a0Ng was desperate for money, he had to agree with his father\u2019s terms, <i>ie</i>, the prices set by the father.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the Mountbatten property was bought in 1980 in Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s name for $988,404 with a mortgage loan of $600,000 from the UOB, Mr\u00a0Ng said that it was his father who paid the upfront money and serviced the mortgage loan. The mortgage was repaid in 1986. Except for a short period when NBB lived there, the property was rented out. As for the 60,000 NBEH shares, it was also his father who provided the cash for the shares at $1 each in 1970. Therefore, the appellants said that NBB was entitled to ask Mr\u00a0Ng for the return of the two assets, claiming that the whole thing was a family arrangement.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr\u00a0Ng explained that in June 1998, he had substantial shareholdings in the two companies, Aromate (owning 62%) and Fustar (owning 50%). He claimed that of the consideration of US$2m received from NBEH, half went into Fustar\u2019s account at the Bank of America in New York and the other half to Aromate\u2019s account with Stanchart. Of the US$1m received for the 60,000 shares, Mr\u00a0Ng claimed that US$600,000 went into Fustar\u2019s account with UOB Hong Kong and US$400,000 into Aromate\u2019s account with Stanchart.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge noted that while Mr\u00a0Ng claimed that NBB had paid for the Mountbatten property, not a piece of document was produced to show that NBB had paid either the cash upfront or the instalments. She found as a fact that NBB did not pay for the property and did not give it to Mr\u00a0Ng as a gift.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, there is one other factor which is inconsistent with the appellants\u2019 claim that NBB had paid for the Mountbatten property. Besides the loan of $600,000 obtained from UOB, Mr\u00a0Ng admitted in cross-examination that he had taken another loan of $325,792.00 from his cousin, Tjoa Him Tjaij, and there is a handwritten note by him indicating that it was for the purchase of the property. This would obviously have gone towards paying for the upfront money which was the shortfall between the purchase price and the UOB loan. The judge also noted that it was probably to fund the purchase of the property.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this context the appellants relied on the fact that UOB required a guarantee from NBB as indicating that Mr\u00a0Ng was incapable of paying for the property and it was NBB who paid for it. We do not see how that follows. Moreover, the guarantee given by NBB was only for the short interim period between the granting of the loan and the registration of the mortgage over the property.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the 60,000 NBEH shares, while Mdm\u00a0Wong accepted that Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s initial shareholding in NBEH came from his father in 1970, over the years Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s shareholding in NBEH varied between 60,000 and 120,000. The trial judge held that it could hardly be said that the 60,000 shares in 1998 were the original 60,000 given to him by his father in 1970. In any event, as the 60,000 shares were given to him, they were his and there was nothing to suggest that Mr\u00a0Ng held them in trust for his father.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge accepted Mdm\u00a0Wong\u2019s assertion that, at the time of the transfer of the two assets, Mr\u00a0Ng had failed to pay Mdm\u00a0Wong the maintenance under the consent order of 1996 and had failed to fulfil his obligations under the Financial Agreement. Mr\u00a0Ng had failed to transfer certain shares to Mdm\u00a0Wong by 15\u00a0February 1998 and had also failed to pay her the promised sum of $500,000 by 4\u00a0March 1998. The judge found (at [37]) that by the transfers, Mr\u00a0Ng had \u201ceffectively reduced the realisable pool of assets from which [Mdm\u00a0Wong] could satisfy her rights\u201d. Those assets were Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s only assets in Singapore. She found that Mr\u00a0Ng had acted dishonestly in effecting the transfers and that his intention was to put them out of Mdm\u00a0Wong\u2019s reach. She said (at [38]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Mr\u00a0Ng] arranged for [the assets] to be transferred at values that were not determined by their market values at the time, and without any investigation of such market values. He came up with the scheme of borrowing money from his father so that it would look like he had no assets which could help pay his debts. Whilst Aromate and Fustar may have been experiencing financial difficulties at that time, I am satisfied that settling those debts was not the dominant reason for the disputed property transfers. Mr\u00a0Ng was more concerned with what he would have to pay Mdm\u00a0Wong in the event that the divorce went through and he wanted to reduce her share of the matrimonial assets as much as he could.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was a finding of fact based on the testimonies of Mr\u00a0Ng and Mdm\u00a0Wong, which an appellate court should be slow to overturn unless it can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. There are four observations which we would make here. First, the entire basis of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s assertion that he needed to dispose of the two assets quickly was due to the creditor banks of Aromate and Fustar breathing down his neck. However, there was no letter of demand from the banks to him or, at least, none was produced. Neither was there any letter of demand from Stanchart to Aromate. There was also no evidence to show that Aromate and Fustar had used the sale proceeds to repay Stanchart and UOB Hong Kong. Second, the evidence of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s then solicitor, Mr\u00a0Tan Kok Keong (\u201cMr\u00a0Tan\u201d), of Mr\u00a0Ng wanting to borrow money urgently from NBB, did not prove anything. The evidence of Mr\u00a0Tan also confirmed that Mr\u00a0Ng had been telling him how he planned to reduce the assets available for division with Mdm\u00a0Wong. Third, having regard to the completely incoherent evidence of NBB in court, the judge was quite correct to have disregarded his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. Borrowing money from his father was a part of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s plot. Fourth, in any event, the transcripts of telephone conversations (though taking place after the events) between Mr\u00a0Ng and third persons, particularly those with NCB on 27 to 28\u00a0October 1999, provided the confirmation that Mr\u00a0Ng had the clear intention to make himself look poor and be in debt so that Mdm\u00a0Wong would not be able to get anything much out of him. The conversation with NCB clearly showed that Mr\u00a0Ng realised that he was giving the Mountbatten property to his father for a low price when he used the term \u201cpawning\u201d. It is clear to us that Mr\u00a0Ng had the intention to reduce his net asset position. Accordingly, we agree with the trial judge that the transfers of the two assets by Mr\u00a0Ng were made with fraudulent intent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants sought to downplay the significance of the transcripts of the telephone conversations on the ground that those conversations did not take place contemporaneously with the sale of the Mountbatten property and the 60,000 NBEH shares. They occurred more than a year later and even then only in one conversation was express reference made to the two assets. We have perused the transcripts and they no doubt confirm that Mr\u00a0Ng had planned it all: to make himself look poor so that Mdm\u00a0Wong would not be able to get at the two assets. He was very conscious of the financial implications which would follow from a divorce.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants next argued that it was wrong for the trial judge to have inferred dishonest intent from the surrounding circumstances. Obviously, if there was direct evidence of such intent that would be the best proof. In our opinion, the transcripts of the telephone conversations provide the direct proof. Even assuming that the telephone conversations could not amount to an admission, it does not follow that such intent may not be inferred from all the circumstances. As Pennycuick VC so poignantly put it in <i>Lloyds Bank Ltd v Marcan</i> [1973] 2\u00a0All ER 359 at 367:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The word \u2018intent\u2019 denotes a state of mind. A man\u2019s intention is a question of fact. Actual intent may unquestionably be proved by direct evidence <i>or may be inferred from surrounding circumstances</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This court had also in <i>Yogambikai Nagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 258</nobr> held that fraud could be inferred from the surrounding circumstances although such an inference should not be lightly made. In <i>Re M\u00a0Kushler, Ltd</i> [1943] 2\u00a0All ER 22, the English Court of Appeal held that an intent to defraud could be inferred from all the circumstances. In the circumstances of the present case we do not see how the trial judge could be faulted for making the inference.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Was Mdm\u00a0Wong a creditor and was she prejudiced?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A related argument raised by the appellants is that Mdm\u00a0Wong was not prejudiced when the agreements for the transfers of the assets were made. Reliance was placed on the fact that in her proof of debt filed in Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s bankruptcy, the debts stated to be owing by Mr\u00a0Ng arose in April 1999 and they were not in respect of any obligation due under the Financial Agreement but under the consent maintenance order of 14\u00a0August 1996. Thus, the appellants claimed that Mdm\u00a0Wong was not a creditor in 1998.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should, at this juncture, add that before us, the appellants further submitted that, in any event, by the time Mdm\u00a0Wong instituted the present action, she was no longer a creditor under the Financial Agreement. Reliance was placed on the case of <i>Cadogan v Cadogan</i> [1977] 3\u00a0All ER 831 (\u201c<i>Cadogan</i>\u201d) where the view was expressed by Goff\u00a0LJ (at 839) that once a claim brought by a plaintiff under s\u00a0172 of the English Law of Property Act 1925 had abated or collapsed, then such a claim could not stand or be sustained.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this further submission, the respondent has objected that this was a new point which was not raised in the court below, relying in this regard on O\u00a057 r 9A(4)(b) of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2004\u00a0Rev Ed). Neither have the appellants sought leave to raise this new point. The respondent also contended that in now raising this point for the first time the appellants have deprived the respondent of the opportunity to specifically put before the trial court all evidence relevant to the issue of her status as Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s creditor at the time the present action was instituted. For this reason, the respondent averred that this court should not allow this point to be canvassed. We agree.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, we would like to make this comment on <i>Cadogan</i>. There, the wife had appealed against an interlocutory ruling striking out her claim to set aside the conveyance of her husband\u2019s property pursuant to s\u00a0172 of the English Law of Property Act 1925. The basis of her claim was that the conveyance by her husband had deprived her of her potential rights for financial provision under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c\u00a018). However, the husband died, resulting in her right to financial relief under the said 1973 Act being abated. The judge at first instance ordered that the claim be struck out on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The English Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the wife\u2019s appeal which meant that her claim under s\u00a0172 would proceed to trial. While Goff\u00a0LJ did make the remark referred to at [34] above, it could not be intended to be the final word. More importantly, in our case here, the factual position is quite different. We do not see how Mdm\u00a0Wong\u2019s rights under the Financial Agreement could be considered to have been abated. Rights acquired before discharge of an agreement are not affected by the discharge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants alleged that the main purpose of the present action by Mdm\u00a0Wong was to ensure that the two assets would be available for division between Mdm\u00a0Wong and Mr\u00a0Ng. In this regard, the appellants relied on this part of the judgment of Prakash\u00a0J at [1]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[This case] is Mdm\u00a0Wong\u2019s attempt to annul the sale and transfer by Mr\u00a0Ng of certain assets so that these assets may be considered for division between her and Mr\u00a0Ng when the ancillary matters attendant on the divorce proceedings are heard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">They submitted that the proper remedy for Mdm\u00a0Wong was under s\u00a0132 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed) and not s\u00a073B of CLPA.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear to us that on the date the two assets were transferred to the appellants, Mr\u00a0Ng had outstanding maintenance due to Mdm\u00a0Wong under the 1996 consent order. In addition, he had not paid the instalment of $500,000 due in March 1998 under the Financial Agreement. After the transfers, further instalments due under the Financial Agreement were outstanding. Similarly, there were outstanding subsequent maintenance payments due to Mdm\u00a0Wong. The fact is that Mr\u00a0Ng was constantly in default in paying maintenance to Mdm\u00a0Wong. It was clear that at all material times, Mdm\u00a0Wong was a creditor of Mr\u00a0Ng.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under s\u00a073B, any person who is a creditor and is prejudiced by the transfer of an asset is entitled to apply to court to set it aside. Mdm\u00a0Wong is such a person. As Mr\u00a0Ng is now a bankrupt the assets upon restoration pursuant to the judgment below will have to be dealt with by the Official Assignee in accordance with the law of insolvency.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Notice of intent to defraud</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants next challenged the finding of the trial judge that the appellants had notice of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s intent to defraud creditors. They averred that the judge was wrong to have found that Mr\u00a0Ng was the controlling mind of both the appellants. The appellants claimed that the true controlling mind was NBB. They emphasised the fact that the first appellant was an investment holding company under the sole control of NBB. As for the second appellant, Mr\u00a0Ng had ceased to be a director thereof from 1993 and the appellants claimed that Mr\u00a0Ng played no part in the transfer of the Mountbatten property to NBEH and of the 60,000 NBEH shares to BBC.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants submitted that for notice of the fraudulent intent of the transferor to be imputed to the transferee, the latter must have actual knowledge, not just constructive knowledge. The appellants submitted that the trial judge seemed to have wrongly applied the concept of constructive knowledge when considering the question of good faith.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we do not think there was any misconception on the part of the trial judge as to the test to be applied in determining knowledge. She recognised that in a case where the transferee, in fact, provided valuable consideration, it must be shown that the transferee had actual knowledge of the intent to defraud on the part of the transferor. This was her observation at [8], when commenting on what was decided by this court in <i>Quah Kay Tee</i>:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where, however, the transfer was made for valuable consideration, to set it aside it must be shown that the transferor acted with the actual intent to defraud creditors and that the transferee had notice of the transferor\u2019s fraudulent intention. The intent of the transferor will not be inferred simply from his disposal of the asset concerned since he is disposing of it for value.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Here, the trial judge found that both the appellants had knowledge of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s scheme in relation to the transfer because he was managing NBEH and, although in relation to BBC, Mr\u00a0Ng was not a director, he was, on the evidence of NCB, <i>de facto</i> running it. He was the controlling mind of the appellants. Although Mr\u00a0Ng would report to his father, NBB, it was often after things had been executed. In any event, the burden of disproving knowledge rests with the transferee. Again this is a finding of fact which we are not disposed to disturb. Thus, knowledge of the devious scheme of Mr\u00a0Ng would be imputed to the appellants.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should add that the trial judge also found that the other director of the appellants, NCB, was aware that the \u201ctransfers\u201d were really to keep the assets out of the reach of Mdm\u00a0Wong. Two of the taped conversations were between Mr\u00a0Ng and NCB. They seemed to show that NCB was aware of Mr\u00a0Ng\u2019s motive in effecting the \u201ctransfers\u201d. NCB was at all material times a substantial shareholder of the second appellant, BBC. He also signed the directors\u2019 resolutions of the appellants to acquire the two assets from Mr\u00a0Ng.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Denning\u00a0LJ said in <i>H\u00a0L Bolton (Engineering) Co Ltd v T\u00a0J Graham &amp; Sons Ltd</i> <nobr>[1957] 1 QB 159</nobr> at 172:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[D]irectors and managers \u2026 represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control what it does.

In this context, the transferee\u2019s acting in good faith must also involve his not having knowledge about the fraudulent intent of the transferor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In substantiation of this submission, the appellants relied upon the following passage from <i>Kerr on the Law of Fraud and Mistake</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th\u00a0Ed, 1986) at p\u00a0337:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A <i>bona fide</i> purchaser, without notice of any fraud on creditors, is more entitled to be protected than the creditors themselves, whose only claim is on the general estate; for he has paid his money for the particular estate which he claims, and is expressly exempted from the operation of the statute, by this section. And even though there be some suspicious circumstances as regards the purchaser\u2019s part in the matter, which may be ground for rigid inquiry, the purchase will nevertheless be held good, unless it is shown that it was a contrivance to defeat creditors, and that the purchaser was privy to it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we see it, the difference between what the judge said and what the author stated is more apparent than real, bearing particularly in mind the qualification made by <i>Kerr on the Law of Fraud and Mistake</i>, namely, \u201cunless it is shown that [the purchase] was a contrivance to defeat creditors\u201d and the statement of the trial judge at [58] of her judgment that \u201c[in] this context, the transferee\u2019s acting in good faith must also involve his not having knowledge about the fraudulent intent of the transferor\u201d. What must be borne in mind is that in the subsequent paragraphs of her judgment, the judge proceeded to find that the appellants had actual knowledge of the fraudulent intent of Mr\u00a0Ng. In short, she found that the appellants were privy to the scheme of Mr\u00a0Ng. How could it be said that the appellants had gone into the transactions in good faith when they knew of the sinister scheme of Mr\u00a0Ng? We need not go further into the question of whether \u201cblind-eye\u201d knowledge would constitute knowledge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Taking of accounts</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to the third issue raised by the appellants. In granting relief to Mdm\u00a0Wong, the trial judge also made orders on the taking of accounts in relating to the transfer of the two assets to the appellants, namely:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There shall be an account (rental or otherwise) received by the first [appellant] from its purported ownership of the Mountbatten property.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There shall be an account of and an inquiry into the profits, if any, made by the second [appellant] arising from the transfers of the [60,000] shares.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants contended that the judge was wrong to have made these consequential orders and in this regard cited the following passage from <i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England</i> vol\u00a018 (Butterworths, 4th\u00a0Ed, 1977) at para\u00a0386:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Creditors are not entitled to an account of the rents and profits of the property received by the transferee before the conveyance is set aside.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The above passage of <i>Halsbury\u2019s</i> is based on the ancient case of <i>Higgins v York Buildings Co</i> (1740) 2\u00a0Atk 107; 26\u00a0ER 467 (\u201c<i>Higgins</i>\u201d) where Lord Hardwicke did not offer any reason why an account for rental and profits should not be made. This view would appear to have been endorsed (in <i>obiter</i>) by Lord\u00a0Romilly\u00a0MR in <i>Reese River Silver Mining Company v Atwell</i> (1869) LR\u00a07 Eq 347 and also by the Upper Canada Court of Error and Appeal in <i>Bank of Upper Canada v Thomas</i> (1864) 2\u00a0E &amp; AR 502. However, in the later Canadian case of <i>Smith v Drew</i> (1877) 25\u00a0Grant 188, the Court of Chancery of Ontario, while recognising the statement of Lord\u00a0Hardwicke in <i>Higgins</i>, left open the question whether the court should have granted an order for an account if asked to do so.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, counsel for Mdm\u00a0Wong quoted the case of <i>In\u00a0re Mouat</i> <nobr>[1899] 1 Ch 831</nobr>, a decision on the Elizabethan Statute, where the English court had not only avoided the fraudulent conveyance but also granted an injunction restraining the transferee from dealing with the traced moneys received under the fraudulently assigned policy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under para\u00a014 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed), it is expressly provided that the High Court has the \u201c[p]ower to grant all reliefs and remedies at law and in equity\u201d. Of course, this only sets out the general power of the High Court. It would be for the court in each case to decide whether a particular relief ought to be granted in the circumstances there prevailing. As we have noted above, Lord\u00a0Hardwicke in <i>Higgins</i> did not give any reason as to why the relief by way of account should not be ordered in addition to the relief of having the property, which was conveyed in breach of the Elizabethan Statute, restored. While it is true that an account of profits is the traditional remedy for breaches of equitable obligations, it did not mean that that remedy may not be granted by the court in other situations. No rule should remain immutable in the eyes of equity. Ultimately, it is the justice of the case which will dictate what relief will be appropriate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, the following observations of Sir\u00a0George Jessel\u00a0MR in <i>In</i>\u00a0<i>re Hallett\u2019s Estate</i> (1880) 13\u00a0Ch D 696 at 710 are germane:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I intentionally say modern rules, because it must not be forgotten that the rules of Courts of Equity are not, like the rules of the Common Law, supposed to have been established from time immemorial. It is perfectly well known that they have been established from time to time \u2013 altered, improved, and refined from time to time. In many cases we know the names of the Chancellors who invented them. No doubt they were invented for the purpose of securing the better administration of justice, but still they were invented.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is significant to note that while ordinarily a breach of contract will only give rise to an award of damages, the House of Lords had in <i>Attorney General v Blake</i> <nobr>[2001] 1 AC 268</nobr> (\u201c<i>Blake</i>\u201d) held that in an exceptional case, where the normal remedies of damages, specific performance and injunction were inadequate compensation for a breach of contract, the court could, if justice demanded it, grant the discretionary remedy of requiring the defendant to account to the plaintiff for the benefits received from the breach of contract. In <i>Blake</i>, the breach related to an undertaking as to confidentiality and the court had noted that that sort of a breach was akin to a breach of fiduciary obligations. The following rationalisation, given by Lord\u00a0Nicholls of Birkenhead as to the necessity in certain circumstances to give an account in a contractual setting, is persuasive (at 284\u2013285):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[T]here seems to be no reason, in principle, why the court must in all circumstances rule out an account of profits as a remedy for breach of contract. I prefer to avoid the unhappy expression \u201crestitutionary damages\u201d. Remedies are the law\u2019s response to a wrong (or, more precisely, to a cause of action). When, exceptionally, a just response to a breach of contract so requires, the court should be able to grant the discretionary remedy of requiring a defendant to account to the plaintiff for the benefits he has received from his breach of contract. In the same way as a plaintiff\u2019s interest in performance of a contract may render it just and equitable for the court to make an order for specific performance or grant an injunction, so the plaintiff\u2019s interest in performance may make it just and equitable that the defendant should retain no benefit from his breach of contract.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\u00a0Nicholls then went on to clarify that no rigid tests could be laid down as to what would constitute an exceptional case. He said (at 285):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The court will have regard to all the circumstances, including the subject matter of the contract, the purpose of the contractual provision which has been breached, the circumstances in which the breach occurred, the consequences of the breach and the circumstances in which relief is being sought. A useful general guide, although not exhaustive, is whether the plaintiff had a legitimate interest in preventing the defendant\u2019s profit-making activity and, hence, in depriving him of his profit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It would be difficult, and unwise, to attempt to be more specific.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverting to the position in the present case, the question to ask is whether avoiding the fraudulent transfers alone would be an adequate remedy to deal with the mischief which s\u00a073B of the CLPA is intended to address. It seems to us that the answer cannot be given in the abstract. It must depend on the particular fact situation of each case. Neither does it follow that an account should be ordered in every case where a conveyance is annulled under s\u00a073B. What is objectionable is the transfer of the property to defraud creditors. Section\u00a073B does not seek to control the manner in which the owner of a property may use his asset or the income he derives therefrom. The owner would otherwise be free, had he not effected the transfer of the property, to allow whom he pleased to occupy the property with or without rental and deal with the rental received in any way he pleased. In the present case, there is no evidence that Mr\u00a0Ng was insolvent at the time the two assets were transferred, although he tried to make himself look impoverished so that there would be less for Mdm\u00a0Wong to look to for division. As Prakash\u00a0J noted in her second judgment in the present case reported at <nobr>[2004] 4 SLR 464</nobr>, s\u00a073B does not differentiate between the situation of a bankrupt debtor and the situation of a non-bankrupt debtor. She opined that the rights of the creditor to avoid a fraudulent transfer were not affected by the status of the debtor. We agree with this view. Thus, we do not think it would be necessary or just that an account should be ordered as from the dates of the transfers. In the present case, if an account should be ordered, it should only be from the date Mr\u00a0Ng was made a bankrupt. This is because as from that date, his creditors would have had an interest in his estate, and thus his assets. From that point onwards, Mr\u00a0Ng would have no longer been free to determine how his assets should be dealt with. An order for account as from that date would be warranted and just. Accordingly, we would vary to that extent only the order to account made by the judge below.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Set-off</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the course of arguments before us, counsel for the parties were requested to submit in writing on whether, if the order of the court below that there be an account of rental and profits was maintained, it would be possible for the appellants to set that off against the two sums which the appellants had paid to Mr\u00a0Ng for the two assets and only prove the balances against the bankruptcy estate of Mr\u00a0Ng. Counsel for the appellants, upon further research, quite rightly, conceded that such a set-off was not permissible.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The governing provision on this question is s\u00a088(1) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap\u00a020, 2000\u00a0Rev Ed) which provides:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">88.</span></b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2014(1) Where there have been any mutual credits, mutual debts or other mutual dealings between a bankrupt and any creditor, the debts and liabilities to which each party is or may become subject as a result of such mutual credits, debts or dealings shall be set-off against each other and only the balance shall be a debt provable in bankruptcy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There shall be excluded from any set-off under subsection\u00a0(1) any debt or liability of the bankrupt which \u2014</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>a</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is not a debt provable in bankruptcy; or</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(<i>b</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 arises by reason of an obligation incurred at a time when the creditor had notice that a bankruptcy petition relating to the bankrupt was pending.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly, there are a number of reasons why a set-off is not permissible in the present situation, the main reason being that there is no mutuality of parties and of debts. The rental and profits which the appellants are required to account to the trustees of the estate of Mr\u00a0Ng would be for the benefit of his creditors in general. However, the US$3m was paid by the appellants to Mr\u00a0Ng and now that Mr\u00a0Ng is a bankrupt, the appellants would have to join the ranks of the unsecured creditors and file their proofs of debt: see <i>Lister v Hooson</i> <nobr>[1908] 1 KB 174.</nobr> The following passage from Rory Derham, <i>The Law of Set-Off</i> (Oxford University Press, 3rd\u00a0Ed, 2003) at para\u00a013.07, while it relates to voidable transactions (at an undervalue or unfair preference) under the insolvency regime, is equally applicable to cases under s\u00a073B:\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A creditor who is liable to return a preferential payment is not entitled to set off against that liability the debt for which the payment was intended to be satisfaction, or indeed any other liability of the bankrupt to him. The trustee\u2019s right to the return of the preference accrues in his own right as trustee, and is not derived from an obligation incurred by the creditor to the bankrupt. The creditor\u2019s liability and the creditor\u2019s claim against the bankrupt accordingly are not mutual. In any event, public policy would dictate that a transaction which Parliament has said should be avoided as a preference should not be able to ground a set-off, because otherwise the efficacy of the preference provision would be severely limited.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, the appeal is allowed only to the limited extent that we vary the order to require the appellants to account for rental and profits as from the date on which Mr\u00a0Ng was made a bankrupt.

He was then insured under eight insurance policies with six different insurance companies, with the proceeds payable to the appellant, Madam Yap Chwee Kim (`Madam Yap`). When Madam Yap attempted to claim the insured sums, only one insurance company paid her the sum insured under the policy. The other five insurance companies, the respondents in this appeal (`the respondents`), refused to make any payment to her under their respective policies. In consequence, Madam Yap brought an action against the respondents claiming  under the respective policies. The sums insured under these seven policies amounted to a total sum of $827,000. Her case was that the insured peril under each policy had occurred, and the deceased had died by accidental drowning. She failed in her action at first instance before Tay Yong Kwang JC, and she appealed. We dismissed her appeal and now give our reasons.<br/><br/><strong><i> The facts </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the time of his death, the deceased was on a five-day package tour to Phnom Penh. His travelling companion was Madam Yap`s ex-husband, Mr Lim Chok Young (`Mr Lim`). Madam Yap and Mr Lim were married in 1979, but in 1994 they divorced. However, they have since reconciled and intend to re-marry. They have a daughter, who is now 14 years old.<br/><br/>At the trial, Madam Yap and Mr Lim initially testified that they were all the family that the deceased had. They said that they had been living with the deceased and taking care of him for over ten years. Madam Yap said that she was the deceased`s goddaughter. Mr Lim said that the deceased was his father`s brother, and thus his uncle by blood. He told the court that he and the deceased were as close as father and son. However, in the course of the trial, it emerged from the evidence adduced by the respondents that the deceased was not related by blood to Mr Lim or Mr Lim`s father after all. This came to light when two real relatives of the deceased, who were alerted by the publicity of the case, came forward to testify on behalf of the respondents. They told the court that Mr Lim`s father was not the deceased`s brother, and Mr Lim was not the deceased`s real nephew. Thereafter, Mr Lim told the court that he had just discovered that the deceased was his father`s sworn brother.<br/><br/>Mr Lim gave the following account of the history between the deceased and himself. Before he and the deceased became close, he had met the deceased on a few occasions. One of those occasions was his father`s funeral, at which the deceased introduced himself to Mr Lim as an uncle. Subsequently, in the late 1980s, the deceased started visiting Mr Lim and Madam Yap at their flat in Hougang (`the Hougang flat`). Mr Lim learnt that the deceased was staying with friends, but was not happy. He invited the deceased to move in with his family.<br/><br/>Madam Yap`s evidence was that the deceased moved in with them sometime in the late 1980s. She had not objected to this arrangement, for she found the deceased to be a simple, understanding and quiet man. His only vice was smoking. She got on well with the deceased. She always assumed that the deceased was Mr Lim`s uncle. According to her, about seven or eight years ago (around 1992 or 1993), the deceased was advised by a Taoist deity to adopt a godchild and he asked her to become his goddaughter. She agreed, and a simple tea ceremony was held to solemnise the relationship. That was how she became his goddaughter.<br/><br/>According to Madam Yap and Mr Lim, their marriage subsequently deteriorated. In or around May 1994, Madam Yap petitioned for a divorce from Mr Lim on the ground that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. In her petition she alleged that Mr Lim had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. The divorce was not contested and the decree nisi was granted in August 1994, which was subsequently made absolute.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the divorce, Mr Lim and Madam Yap remained in close contact with each other. In the division of matrimonial property, Madam Yap`s share or interest in the Hougang flat was transferred to Mr Lim in consideration of his paying her all the moneys (together with interests) withdrawn from her account in the Central Provident Fund Board, for the purchase of the flat. She subsequently purchased a flat in Woodlands in her own name (`the Woodlands flat`) and moved there. Apparently, the couple did not live separately for long. They said that they had organised their living arrangements around the needs of their daughter. As for the deceased, he continued to stay with Mr Lim after the latter`s divorce from Madam Yap. Occasionally, he also stayed at Madam Yap`s Woodlands flat. In early 1996, Mr Lim sold the Hougang flat and purchased a flat in Yishun (`the Yishun flat`).<br/><br/>In January 1996, a life policy for $7,000 and a personal accident policy for $20,000 were bought for the deceased from the second respondent. The premium for these policies were paid by Mr Lim. The particulars of the two insurance policies are as follows:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Second respondent</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Personal accident</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">22 January 1996, renewed on 27 December 1996</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$39/annum</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$20,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Second respondent</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Life</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">25 January 1996</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$121.35/every three months</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$7,000</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Insurance company </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Type of policy/relevant coverage </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Date of issue </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Premium </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Assured sum </i>\n      </strong>In late 1996, Mr Lim helped the deceased to purchase a flat at Petir Road (`the Petir Road flat`) in the latter`s sole name. The deposit for the flat was paid by Mr Lim. After the purchase, one of the bedrooms of the flat was rented out, and the deceased used the other one. But he would still stay with either Mr Lim or Madam Yap every now and then.<br/><br/>In November 1996, Mr Lim and Madam Yap converted to Christianity and were baptized at St Andrew`s Cathedral. After attending instruction and counselling classes together at the Cathedral, their relationship improved vastly. Around that time, Mr Lim moved into Madam Yap`s flat in Woodlands and stayed with her and their daughter. They were almost reconciled and lived as husband and wife.<br/><br/>On 22 February 1997, a will was made by the deceased by which he bequeathed all his assets to Madam Yap. Mr Lim brought the deceased to a lawyer`s office to have the will made.<br/><br/>Thereafter, Mr Lim and the deceased started to make frequent trips together. According to Mr Lim, these trips came about after the deceased won several thousand dollars in the lottery. He was jobless at that time and kept asking Mr Lim to go on trips with him. At that time, Mr Lim was a container truck driver for the Ministry of Environment, earning a monthly salary of $1,600. He was able to travel frequently with the deceased as he had accumulated his `time-offs` and had medical and annual leave entitlements. Between February 1997 and May 1997, the two of them made three trips together, namely to Malaysia, Thailand and  Indonesia respectively. Madam Yap and her daughter did not go on any of those trips.<br/><br/>On 21 April 1997, Mr Lim and the deceased booked a five-day packaged tour to Phnom Penh covering the period from 30 May 1997 to 3 June 1997. The cost of the trip was $588 per person, with an initial deposit of $200 each. Having booked the trip, Mr Lim said that they began to worry about the unstable social and political situation in Cambodia, as well as the danger of landmines. At one point, they contemplated cancelling the trip. In the end, they decided not to do so as they did not want to lose their deposits. Instead, they went out and bought extensive insurance coverage for the trip.<br/><br/><strong><i> The insurance policies </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The tour was booked on 21 April 1997, and the departure date was 30 May 1997. Between these two dates, the deceased, with Mr Lim`s help, bought six travel and personal accident insurance policies covering himself for, inter alia, death and personal injury resulting from accidental causes. The particulars of these six travel and personal accident policies are as follows:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">First Respondent</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Travel/death and personal injury from accident</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">21 April 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$79</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$200,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Second Respondent</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Travel/death and personal injury from accident or violent causes</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">27 May 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$60</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$200,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Third Respondent</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Travel/death and personal injury from accident</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">27 May 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$35</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$100,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Fourth Respondent</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Travel/death and personal injury from accident</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">15 May 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$65</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$200,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Fifth Respondent</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Travel/death and personal injury from accident</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">23 May 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$36</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$100,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd (not a party)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Travel/death and personal injury from accident or violent causes</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">20 May 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$10.82/month</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$100,000</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Insurance company </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Type of policy/relevant coverage </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Date of issue </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Premium </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Assured sum </i>\n      </strong>The total amount of premiums for these six policies came to $285.82. He was already covered by two other policies, which had been taken out earlier in 1996.  In total, he was covered by eight insurance policies and the assured sums under all these policies came to a total of $927,000.<br/><br/>In addition to these policies, he also applied for three other travel policies from another insurance company, namely, American International Assurance Co Ltd (`AIA`), and paid a total of $764.32 as premium or deposit. These three applications were still pending at the time of his death, and were rejected by AIA on 10 June 1997. The particulars of these three policies, if approved and issued by AIA, would be as follows:<br/><br/></p>\n    <table align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">AIA (not a party)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Personal accident and health</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">26 May 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$60.15/semi-annually</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$5,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">AIA</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Personal accident and health</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">26 May 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$60.15/semi-annually</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$5,000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\">AIA (not a party)</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">Personal accident and health</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">26 May 1997</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$644.02/semi-annually</td>\n        <td width=\"33%\">$300,000</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Insurance company </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Type of policy/relevant coverage </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Date taken out </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Premium </i>\n      </strong>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Assured sum </i>\n      </strong>Mr Lim conceded that the deceased was probably influenced by him to purchase all those policies. He himself was a great believer in the benefits of insurance, after having seen how insurance moneys had aided a colleague`s family after the colleague`s untimely death. For the trip to Cambodia, he bought three travel insurance policies to cover himself, the total assured sum being $400,000. His explanation for buying less travel insurance policies for himself as compared to the deceased, was that he was already covered by four other policies totalling about $409,000.<br/><br/><strong><i> Trip to Phnom Penh </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>An account of their tour to Phnom Penh and what happened there was given by Mr Lim, and it was this. On 30 May 1997, Mr Lim and the deceased left for Phnom Penh as part of a tour group of six persons. In Phnom Penh, the deceased shared a room with Mr Lim at the Pailin Hotel. On the first evening, they had dinner and then returned to the hotel at about 9pm. On the second day, they visited temples and museums together with the rest of the tour group. On the third day, the deceased did not join the tour group on its outing. His legs were aching and he did not like the food. He only joined the group for lunch and for dinner at the hotel. Mr Lim was with the rest of the group. As for the fourth day of the tour, ie 2 June 1997, no activities had been planned for the tour group. The other four members of the group decided to fly to Siem Reap to tour the ancient city ruins of Angkor Wat. The deceased did not want to go. Mr Lim decided to stay back in Phnom Penh to be with the deceased. That morning, they had breakfast at a restaurant in the hotel, and were seen chatting with the rest of the group in the hotel lobby before the others departed for Angkor Wat. A couple in the group asked Mr Lim to develop a roll of film for them at the studio opposite the hotel. He agreed to do so as he himself had some film to develop. He and the deceased then returned to their room together to get his camera. In the room, he used up the remaining film  in his camera by taking pictures of the deceased in the room. They then went down together to the lobby, where the deceased waited for him while he went to the studio across the road to hand in the rolls of film for developing. Thereafter, he rejoined the deceased in the hotel lobby and they returned to their room together. It was shortly past nine in the morning. They rested and watched television. At around 10am, two chambermaids entered the room to clean it. This took about 15 to 20 minutes.<br/><br/>At about 11am, Mr Lim took a shower, and thereafter he had some coffee and tidied his luggage. He suggested to the deceased to take a bath before they went down for lunch. He made this suggestion because the deceased enjoyed taking baths in a tub, a luxury which he could not enjoy at home in Singapore, as they did not have a bathtub. The deceased then turned on the tap to fill the bathtub. At about 11.30am, Mr Lim left the room to collect the negatives and the photographs that he had left for developing earlier that morning. Before he left, he instructed the deceased to meet him downstairs in the hotel lobby for lunch at around 12noon. As he was leaving, the deceased was standing beside the bathroom and smoking a cigarette. The bathtub was still being filled. After collecting the negatives and the photographs, Mr Lim returned to the lobby where he inserted his photographs into the albums while he waited for the deceased. By 12.15pm, the deceased still had not turned up, so Mr Lim went up to the room. He unlocked the door and noticed that the bathroom door was shut and the television was switched on. He knocked on the bathroom door, but got no response. He could hear the sound of running water in the bathroom. When he pushed the door open, he saw the deceased, lying naked and face-down in the bathtub, which was filled with water. The tap was still running. He was scared and he immediately shouted for help. The two chambermaids came running into the room and they helped him to lift the body out of the bathtub and onto the floor. After that, many people arrived at the scene to render assistance. The deceased`s body was moved onto the bed. Mr Lim put a tee-shirt and a pair of shorts on the deceased`s body. The authorities then arrived.<br/><br/><strong><i> Investigation in Phnom Penh </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>An investigation was conducted by the Cambodian Investigation Committee comprising, among others, police officers, a forensic medical doctor and a representative of the Procurator of Phnom Penh. The members of the committee, among other things, inspected the corpse and interviewed Mr Lim and the two chambermaids of the hotel. The deceased was found to have sustained a small scratch on his right wrist, and two small scratches on his left cheek. After their investigations, they certified that the deceased had died from accidental drowning. They expressed the view that either he slipped on the wet floor of the bathroom and fell into the bathtub or he fell in as a result of a fainting spell. They did not suspect foul play, and therefore a full autopsy was not performed.<br/><br/>The deceased`s body was cremated two days later, on 4 June 1997, in a temple in Phnom Penh. Mr Lim said that he arranged for the cremation in Phnom Penh because it would have cost him US$6,000 to transport the corpse back to Singapore. He discussed the matter with Madam Yap over the telephone, and they decided that it was better to cremate the body in Phnom Penh. Mr Lim did not stay  for the cremation. He left for Singapore on 3 June 1997 together with the tour group. That was a day before the cremation took place. He returned a few days later, on 6 June 1997, to collect the ashes and then returned to Singapore on 8 June 1997. The ashes were laid to rest at the Mandai Crematorium after some rites were performed. Madam Yap was busy working that day and did not accompany Mr Lim to pay her last respects to the deceased.<br/><br/><strong><i> Claim against insurance companies </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Subsequently, when Madam Yap and Mr Lim were clearing out the Petir Road flat, they found the eight insurance policies taken out by the deceased and issued in Madam Yap`s name. They also found a will made by the deceased, dated 22 February 1997, appointing Madam Yap as the executrix and making her the sole beneficiary of his estate. Madam Yap said that she had not been aware of the existence of either the policies or the will. She was very surprised to discover that she was the beneficiary. She said that Mr Lim also expressed surprise at the time they found the policies and the will. Mr Lim told the court that until then he had forgotten all about the insurance policies.<br/><br/>The only insurance company that made the payment under the policy issued by it was Great Eastern Life Assurance Co (`Great Eastern`). Great Eastern paid out the sum of $100,000 to Madam Yap in 1998, and the amount was credited into the joint account of Madam Yap and Mr Lim. The other insurance companies, namely, the five respondents, refused to make any payment. Madam Yap instituted proceedings against them for recovery of the amounts due under the respective policies. Her claim was that the insured peril had occurred, and the deceased had died by accidental drowning after falling into the bathtub, either by slipping on the wet tiles in the bathroom, or due to a fainting spell while stepping into the bathtub. In support, she relied heavily on the findings of the Cambodian Investigation Committee. The respondents resisted the claims and in their defence put forward a positive case: they asserted that the deceased`s death was not accidental but was intentionally caused by Mr Lim, either acting on his own, or in a conspiracy with Madam Yap. The trial judge found in favour of the respondents and dismissed Madam Yap`s claim.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before us, there were two main findings made by the judge which were seriously challenged. The first finding related to the divorce of Madam Yap and Mr Lim. In the course of the trial, the judge on his own initiative carried out an extensive investigation into the living arrangements of Madam Yap and Mr Lim after their divorce and each of them was questioned by the judge on these matters at very great length. On the basis of their evidence, the judge came to the conclusion that their divorce was a sham. He said at [para ]230:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I now come to the testimony of the Plaintiff and Lim Chok Young. It is clear to me that their divorce in 1994 was nothing more than a sham. They never ceased to live together as husband and wife even if the official records such as their Identity Cards showed them to have different addresses. The only reason the Plaintiff was confused in her testimony about where she was living after her divorce was because her evidence was concocted and utterly false.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Later the judge said that the reason why parties went through the `charade` of a divorce was the money which they could make from their property. He said at [para ]237:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The next question to ask must be, why did they go through the charade of a divorce? The answer is simple - money. Under HDB regulations, the Plaintiff, with the daughter in her custody, was eligible to buy a flat. Lim Chok Young, single after the divorce, was above 35 years in age and could purchase a three-room flat on his own account. He knew that these regulations were in existence for years and yet pretended to have learned about them only after the divorce. Obviously, one of the rooms in the Yishun flat was rented out to earn income for Lim Chok Young with the other room probably used to house the deceased at some point in time. After two and a half years of possession, Lim Chok Young would be able to sell the Yishun flat, hopefully for the same huge profits that he made from the capital gain on his Hougang flat. I take judicial notice of the fact that prices for all sorts of real property were in an upswing in 1993 and 1994. That was why they decided to \"divorce\" in 1994. Unfortunately for Lim Chok Young, property prices did not continue their upward swing after 1996 and he was lucky to be able to sell the Yishun flat (after the requisite two and a half years of possession) with some profit.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Mr Edmond Pereira, counsel for Madam Yap, submitted that the judge was in error in pursuing the issue as to the genuineness of the divorce and making a finding that the divorce was a sham. First, such an issue was never raised by the parties in the pleadings and none of the facts surrounding the divorce proceedings and their subsequent living arrangements were in issue and pleaded. Counsel for the respondents did not question either Madam Yap or Mr Lim on the genuineness of their divorce. No suggestion or allegation as to the falsity of the divorce was made by or on behalf of the respondents. In these circumstances, it was wrong for the judge to pursue this issue on his own and make an adverse finding against Madam Yap and Mr Lim, which in turn influenced his evaluation of the evidence of Mr Lim in his dealings with the deceased, and eventually the finding that Mr Lim with or without the complicity of Madam Yap had caused the death of the deceased.<br/><br/>In considering this complaint of Mr Pereira, we should mention that a trial judge has very wide power under s 167 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) to ask questions of any witness who is before him. Section 167 provides as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(1) The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form at any time, of any witness or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question.  </p>\n        <p>(2) The judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Act to be relevant and duly proved.  </p>\n        <p>(3) This section shall not authorise any Judge to compel any witness to answer any question or to produce any document which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under sections 123 to 133 if the question were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask under section 150 or 151; nor shall he dispense with the primary evidence of any document, except in the cases excepted in this Act.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>However, such wide power must be exercised with caution and within well-recognised limits with judicial calm and detachment and without usurping or assuming the functions of counsel. Case law has shown that, while a trial judge has the power to ask questions of witnesses at any stage of the hearing, an excessive exercise of such power may, and indeed would, operate unfairly against the witnesses and litigants. A general statement on the role a judge should play in this regard is to be found in the judgment of Denning LJ in the case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Jones v National Coal Board</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1957] 2 QB 55</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1957] 2 All ER 155</font> at 159:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[T]he judge sits to hear and determine the issues raised by the parties, not to conduct an investigation or examination on behalf of society at large, as happens, we believe, in some foreign countries. Even in England, however, a judge is not a mere umpire to answer the question \"How`s that?\" His object, above all, is to find out the truth, and to do justice according to law; and in the daily pursuit of it the advocate plays an honourable and necessary role ... And Lord Greene M.R. who explained that justice is best done by a judge who holds the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations? If a judge, said Lord Greene, should himself conduct the examination of witnesses, \"he, so to speak, descends into the arena and is liable to have his vision clouded by the dust of conflict\": see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Yuill v Yuill</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1945] 1 All ER 183</font>(Unreported)  at 189).</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>And the learned Lord Justice continued ([1957] 2 QB 55 at 64; [1957] 2 All ER 155 at 159):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The judge`s part in all this is to hearken to the evidence, only himself asking questions of witnesses when it is necessary to clear up any point that has been overlooked or left obscure; to see that the advocates behave themselves seemly and keep to the rules laid down by law; to exclude irrelevancies and discourage repetition; to make sure by wise intervention that he follows the points that the advocates are making and can assess their worth; and at the end to make up his mind where the truth lies. If he goes beyond this, he drops the mantle of a judge and assumes the robe of an advocate; and the change does not become him well.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In that case, the English Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that the judge at first instance had excessively interrupted counsel`s cross-examination and at times, to a substantial extent, had conducted the examination of the witnesses himself. It was held that he had hindered the fair conduct of the trial, and had effectively taken cross-examination of the witnesses out of the hands of counsel.<br/><br/>In the case of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>R v Mawson</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1967]  VR 205</font>, the Full Court of the Supreme Court in Victoria ordered a new trial on the ground of substantial involvement and interference by the judge in the conduct of the trial, coupled with his failure to warn the jury of their right to disregard the strong comments on the facts of the case.<br/><br/>Reverting to the case at hand, we think that Mr Pereira made a valid point in his submission that the judge ought not to have conducted an investigation on his own as to the circumstances relating to the divorce of Madam Yap and Mr Lim, and to have made the finding that the divorce was a sham. First, the question whether the divorce was a sham was not raised in the pleadings. Nor was it raised in the affidavit evidence adduced by the respondents; nor in the cross-examination by counsel for the respondents. Authorities are in abundance on the point that a court should not decide on issues not raised in the pleadings:  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Kiaw Aik Hang Co  v Tan Tien Choy</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1964::99:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1964::99:\">  [1964] MLJ 99 </a>;  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ong Seow Pheng v Lotus Development Corp</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1997:3:137:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1997:3:137:\">  [1997] 3 SLR 137 </a>;  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Multi-Pak Singapore (in receivership) v Intraco</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1992:2:793:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1992:2:793:\">  [1992] 2 SLR 793 </a>; and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Ohm Mariana ex Peony</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1993:2:698:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1993:2:698:\">  [1993] 2 SLR 698 </a>. In our opinion, the judge should not have proceeded on his own to investigate the question and made the finding that the divorce was a sham.<br/><br/>Because the genuineness of the divorce was not an issue raised by any of the parties, no evidence was led by either counsel on that matter. The only evidence before the court as to that matter was the evidence uncovered by the judge by his own questions. There was little examination or cross-examination of the witnesses by either counsel on that matter. The judge`s finding was purely an inferential one, which he drew essentially from the fact that Madam Yap and Mr Lim had never ceased to live together at the time of divorce and thereafter, and that in the division of the matrimonial property, Madam Yap only got back her CPF moneys with interest in consideration of the transfer of her share or interest to Mr Lim. The judge held that the reason why the parties went through the divorce was the money they could make from the sale of the Hougang flat and their separate acquisition of the properties, namely: the flat in Woodlands by Madam Yap and the flat in Yishun by Mr Lim.<br/><br/>We did not find the living arrangements Madam Yap and Mr Lim had at the material time to be highly unusual. The parties have a daughter and at that time she was only about eight years old and was attending a primary school near the Hougang flat. Madam Yap had the custody of the daughter and found it convenient to continue staying there. At that time her flat in Woodlands which she had applied for was not ready. Speaking generally, instances are many where couples, who have divorced, continue to live under the same roof for lack of alternative accommodation, especially when they have children who are attending schools near their home. It is also not uncommon for the parties to be making efforts at reconciliation even though divorce proceedings have started and are progressing. It is true that it is somewhat inexplicable that Madam Yap should be so generous in agreeing to the division of the matrimonial property, but on this point neither Madam Yap nor Mr Lim was asked the reason for such division of the matrimonial flat. It should be borne in mind also that at that time Madam Yap was represented by a lawyer, and one would assume that she had the benefit of legal advice in the division of the matrimonial property.<br/><br/>As for the motive which the judge attributed to the parties for going through the divorce, we found that that was not borne out by the property transactions which the parties carried out. The divorce took place in 1994 and the Hougang flat, which was bought in 1984 direct from HDB, was sold only in early 1996. Mr Lim made some capital gain from the sale, but then that was after a period of over ten years. If the motive for the divorce was the capital gain to be made from the sale, then the parties or Mr Lim would have sold it immediately or very soon after the divorce. In any case, that capital gain could still have been realized without going through the divorce. Before the divorce proceedings started, Madam Yap and Mr Lim had applied for the flat in Woodlands, which is an executive flat. They could have sold the Hougang flat after the Woodlands flat was allocated and made the capital gain. Mr Lim`s name was only removed from the application after the divorce, and Madam Yap became the sole applicant and she eventually got the flat at Woodlands. Apparently, that was part of the agreement in the division of  matrimonial property between her and Mr Lim. It is true that after the divorce, Mr Lim bought the flat in Yishun. The judge said that Mr Lim bought the flat to make more money, but the fact remained that after the purchase he rented out only one room and not the entire flat. According to his evidence, he sold the flat in 1998, as at that time he was reconciled with Madam Yap and had moved back to the flat in Woodlands. His evidence on this point was entirely consistent with the facts stated by Madam Yap. Looking at the totality of the evidence given by Madam Yap and Mr Lim, we did not find it sufficient to support a reasonably strong inference that the divorce was a sham.<br/><br/>The other finding of the judge which was challenged by the appellant was that Mr Lim and Madam Yap had conspired to cause the death of the deceased for money. The judge said at [para ]254:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Once the entire chain of events and all the surrounding circumstances were considered together, rather than as isolated, unrelated parts, I could only arrive at the irresistible conclusion that Lim Chok Young and his wife, the Plaintiff, driven by their determination to become rich, conspired to cause the death of the deceased intentionally in order to benefit from the insurance monies. Lim Chok Young was the prime mover of the whole scheme. Even if the Plaintiff was not aware of the exact details of the plot to extinguish the life of the deceased, she obviously knew that an \"accident\" of some sort had been planned for the poor simpleton abroad.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Here again we did not find that there was sufficient evidence to implicate Madam Yap in a conspiracy with Mr Lim to cause the death of the deceased for money. There was no evidence indicating that Madam Yap knew that the deceased had made a will making her the sole beneficiary of his estate and that he had purchased numerous insurance policies. She had no involvement in the deceased making his will or in the deceased taking out any of the insurance policies. Of course, it could be inferred that, since Madam Yap and Mr Lim had been reconciled and were living together, she must have known of the will made by the deceased and the insurance policies taken out by him. But it would be going too far to infer further that she not only knew, but also must have agreed to whatever plot Mr Lim had planned for the deceased. On the evidence adduced, probably Madam Yap knew that between February and April 1997 Mr Lim and the deceased together made trips to Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, and that, on 30 May 1997, Mr Lim and the deceased went on their trip to Cambodia. However, that knowledge alone was not sufficient to give rise to an inference that she knew or expect that a fatal accident would befall the deceased, while they were in Cambodia.<br/><br/>Looking at the totality of the evidence, we did not find that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding implicating Madam Yap in a conspiracy to cause the death of the deceased.<br/><br/><strong><i> Madam Yap`s claim </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now turn to the claim of Madam Yap. Before us, her case was that the deceased died on 2 June 1997 from accidental drowning while in Phnom Penh, and on that ground she was entitled to recover under the policies. The burden was on her to prove her claim on a balance of probabilities:  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>NE Neter &amp; Co v Licenses and General Insurance Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1944] 1 All ER 341</font>;  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Freighter `Kieng Kung`</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1965:2:60:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1965:2:60:\">  [1965] 2 MLJ 60 </a>(Unreported)  and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Regina Fur Co v Bossom</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1958] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 425</font>.<br/><br/>In seeking to establish her claim, Madam Yap relied substantially on the report of the Cambodian Investigation Committee. In considering the report, it must be borne in mind that at the material time, the members of the Committee were totally unaware that the deceased was heavily insured for accidental death and that all the policies were taken out at the request and with the assistance of Mr Lim. They were also not apprised of the background and other material information relating to the deceased and his relationship with Mr Lim, which only unfolded at the trial. Whatever information concerning the deceased that was furnished to the Committee was given by Mr Lim alone. It was therefore not surprising that, apart from interviewing Mr Lim and the two chambermaids who helped Mr Lim to lift the deceased from the bathtub, they did not perform an autopsy, but merely conducted an external examination of the deceased`s body. In the absence of a complete autopsy, it was not possible in this case, purely on the basis of the report, to determine the true cause of death of the deceased. The judge did not accept the report, and we likewise were unable to accept it also.<br/><br/>We now turn to other material evidence before the judge and his evaluation of such evidence and the relevant findings he made. First, the evidence as to the type of person the deceased was. Evidence on this point was given by the deceased`s sister, Ms Lim Kim Poh, and another relative, Mr Sim Chye Huat, who is the brother of the sister-in-law of the deceased. Both of them knew the deceased well. In brief, their evidence was to the effect that the deceased was a person of low mentality, was trusting and gullible, was easily bullied by others, and was not a person who knew how to plan for his future or to save money. He remained single and never had a steady job. On the basis of their evidence, the judge came to the conclusion that the deceased was a simple-minded person with no wife, children and no dependants and had no income. He held that the deceased on his own could never have acquired the flat at Petir Road. Nor would he know what a will was. The judge said at [para ]238:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... I accept as a fact that the deceased would never have thought of purchasing a flat on his own. He did not have any savings, was unemployed and was not one given to planning for his future. He could never have afforded the luxury of owning a flat. The Petir Road flat was, for all intents and purposes, the property of Lim Chok Young who was astute enough to protect his investment by causing the deceased to make the will in February 1997, leaving all his earthly possessions to the Plaintiff. Again, the deceased was not someone who would have known what a will was, much less thought about it and then decided to go to town to see a lawyer.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>This finding was not challenged before us. We agree with the judge. Both the purchase of the Petir Road flat and the making of the will by the deceased were arranged by Mr Lim. Indeed we would say they were made by the deceased at the behest of Mr Lim.<br/><br/>Secondly, turning to the insurance policies, we find it quite astonishing that a person like the deceased could have taken out eight policies before he departed for his tour to Phnom Penh. Admittedly, the two policies issued by the second respondent were taken out in early 1996. However, with reference to the other six policies, they were taken out by the deceased within a short span of less than two months, namely, between 21 April 1997, on which the tour to Phom Penh was booked, and 30 May 1997, the departure date of the tour. The total premium paid for these six policies came to $285.82. As if these eight policies were not enough,  the deceased, in addition, applied for three more policies - personal accident policies - from AIA and paid a total premium or deposit amounting to $764.32; these three applications were still pending at the date of the deceased`s departure for the tour. All in all, there were 11 policies, including the three AIA policies, if approved and issued, and the total of the assured sums came to a huge amount of $1,237,000. By any standard and on any view, this was a colossal sum of insurance for a person such as the deceased, who had no fixed job or was unemployed and probably had no income and had no children or dependant to look after and provide for. On the basis of the evidence adduced, we did not have the slightest doubt that Mr Lim was instrumental in causing the deceased to purchase the eight policies and to apply for the three AIA policies.<br/><br/>Mr Pereira, in the case for the appellant, drew our attention to the fact that Mr Lim himself also took out large insurance cover for his travel to various countries. For example, for his trip to China, which he made in 1994, he bought a travel policy from the second respondent for the sum of $500,000, and for his trip to South Korea in 1996, he bought a policy for at least $200,000. In respect of the trip to Phnom Penh, he had at the time insurance cover for the total sum of $409,000. We were unable to find this as a satisfactory explanation or reason for the large number of insurance policies taken out by the deceased. First, the insurance policies taken out by Mr Lim were nowhere near those taken out by the deceased both in terms of the number of policies and the quantum of the amount insured. Secondly, unlike the deceased, Mr Lim has Madam Yap and a daughter to support and provide for.<br/><br/>The judge found that all the insurance policies taken out by the deceased were effected at the behest of Mr Lim. The judge said at [para ]248:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I find that the five travel insurance policies in question in this trial were all applied for by Lim Chok Young, with or without the presence of the deceased. The deceased was obviously an uneducated and happy-go-lucky man whose furthest thoughts about the future were probably his next meal and his next cigarette. He simply had no savings to splash on insurance-shopping or on tours. Insurance was already something so foreign to him, what more $1.2 million worth just before a five-day trip to Cambodia! I have no hesitation in rejecting Lim Chok Young`s assertions that the deceased was converted to his deep abiding faith in insurance and that the deceased fortuitously came into lottery money just before he became unemployed. The truth of the matter was that the deceased was never gainfully employed for any appreciable period of time due to his poor eyesight, low intellect and generally carefree approach to life. Getting the deceased`s thumbprint or his handwritten name on application forms for insurance would have been as easy as getting the deceased to light up a cigarette. As was evident from Lim Chok Young`s own testimony, the insured did not even need to be present at the agencies. All the premiums were paid by Lim Chok Young who needed no reimbursement as the policies were his idea anyway and they were small change compared to what he hoped to reap in the subsequent insurance claims.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the above observations, the judge mentioned specifically the five travel policies, but it is implicit in his judgment that the same was true with reference to the other policies as well. We are in full agreement with the finding made by the judge. Here again we did not find that there was any challenge to this finding by the judge.<br/><br/>Thirdly, we considered also the trips the deceased and Mr Lim made together to other countries in South East Asia between February and May 1997. That they made the trips was not disputed. On such trips, the judge made the following damning observation at [para ]255:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The trips by Lim Chok Young and the deceased to neighbouring countries between February and May 1997 were nothing more than a ploy by Lim Chok Young to create the impression that they were constant, merry travelling companions. The trips were not made in order that a kind and altruistic \"nephew\" could fulfil his aging uncle`s wish to travel by aeroplane - they were flights in the final journey leading to the eventual designated place of execution. Lim Chok Young also did not want an autopsy to be conducted here for it might reveal the actual cause of death of the deceased.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>For our purpose, we would not go so far as to say that these trips were `nothing more than a ploy` by Mr Lim and were `flights in the final journey leading to the eventual designated place of execution`. All the same, the reasons given by Mr Lim for these trips were, to say the least, not quite convincing, and the reasons for making these trips were suspect.<br/><br/>The totality of all this evidence and the findings made by the judge cast serious doubts on Madam Yap`s claim that the deceased died from accidental drowning. There was a very strong suspicion that the death of the deceased was homicidal, and not accidental, and that Mr Lim was involved in causing it. We were certainly not satisfied that the deceased died from accidental drowning. In our judgment, Madam Yap had not discharged the burden of proof and her claim failed and was rightly dismissed by the judge.<br/><br/>Having come to this conclusion, it is unnecessary to go further and consider whether, on a balance of probabilities, Mr Lim intentionally caused the death of the deceased. Nor is it necessary to determine the secondary issue relating to a certain condition in some of the policies, which the judge held was a condition precedent to the recovery, with which Madam Yap did not comply and therefore she was disentitled from recovering under the policies.<br/><br/>For the reasons we have given, we dismissed the appeal with costs.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\"

The parties were married on 11\u00a0October 1995,\n                    and by the time the ancillary proceedings had commenced, the wife was\n                    60\u00a0years old and the husband was 72\u00a0years old. As there were no\n                    children of the marriage, and the wife did not claim a share of the matrimonial\n                    assets, the only ancillary matter before this court was that of maintenance of\n                    the wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The parties resided in a double storey corner\n                    terrace house during the marriage.

Firstly, there was a dispute over whether the\n                    husband had maintained the wife during the marriage. The wife claimed that\n                    maintenance had been provided, although, as the Judge noted, her position\n                    regarding the quantum of maintenance allegedly provided had been inconsistent\n                    (see the GD at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_6 ext\">[6]</ParaXRef>\u2013<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_8 ext\">[8]</ParaXRef>). The husband, in contrast, insisted that\n                    he had not maintained the wife during the marriage.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_5\">5</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_5\" label=\"5\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">RC at\n                                p\u00a011, [3.9.1].</Text></Para></Footnote> As was apparent during\n                    submissions (at least on the part of the husband), this insistence was thought\n                    to justify the position that a husband who had not maintained his wife during\n                    the course of the marriage need not do so after the marriage was dissolved. This\n                    was an unfortunate reading of a husband\u2019s obligation to maintain his\n                    former wife under the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed)\n                    (\u201cthe Act\u201d), which we shall elaborate on later. The second factual\n                    dispute concerned the wife\u2019s current financial position.

From the way the parties behaved before the breakdown, it may\n                            be clear that, but for the breakdown, the wife would have continued to\n                            be the financial mainstay of the family. It would hardly be right for\n                            the husband to claim that, on divorce, he was entitled to be put back in\n                            his financial status quo, even if this meant the wife's paying him more\n                            than half her income.</Emphasis></Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"i\">It is notoriously true that two separate homes are much\n                            more expensive to run than one.

Of course, what is\n                    reasonable depends on all the circumstances of the case; that a wife is\n                    financially capable does not <Emphasis type=\"i\">per se</Emphasis> excuse a\n                    husband from his duty to maintain her, although it may affect the quantum of\n                    maintenance deemed to be reasonable: see Tan Cheng Han, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Matrimonial Law in Singapore and Malaysia</Emphasis> (Butterworths Asia,\n                    1994) at pp\u00a0205\u2013206.

However, the husband argued that since the wife did not\n                    claim a share of the matrimonial assets, and since he would have to sell the\n                    matrimonial home in order to provide her with rental of an HDB flat, the wife\n                    would effectively be obtaining a share of the matrimonial assets <Emphasis type=\"i\">via</Emphasis> the backdoor.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_24\">24</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_24\" label=\"24\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">RC at\n                                pp\u00a034\u201335,\n                        [4.1.13]\u2013[4.1.14].</Text></Para></Footnote> We did not agree with this\n                    contention.

Secondly, requiring the husband to pay for <Emphasis type=\"i\">rental</Emphasis> of an HDB flat was eminently reasonable in the\n                    circumstances, given the type of accommodation the wife had been accustomed to\n                    during the marriage. It would perhaps have been a different matter had the wife\n                    requested the purchase price of an HDB flat, or if parties had lived in an HDB\n                    flat prior to the breakdown of their marriage.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the circumstances, we were of the view that\n                    an order for lump sum maintenance of $126,000 would be fair and reasonable,\n                    based on a multiplicand of $1,500, being the monthly rental of an HDB flat, and\n                    a multiplier of 7\u00a0years. The husband submitted that <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yow\n                        Mee Lan</Emphasis> should be applied to halve the multiplicand in order to\n                    account for his status as a retiree.

The Judge held that since the Bankrupt had attempted to give away his share of the Properties to the appellant by way of the ICJ during the Relevant Period, the Disposition was void unless it was ratified by the court (see the GD at [18]). The Judge declined to ratify the Disposition, concluding that much more was required of the appellant in order to persuade the court to ratify what appeared, without more, to have been an attempt to keep the Bankrupt\u2019s interest in the Properties out of the reach of his creditors (see the GD at [37]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The issues on appeal</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The issues on appeal were as follows:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_7-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">whether s\u00a077(1) applies to a disposition of property pursuant to a court order;</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_7-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">whether the appellant falls within s\u00a077(3)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>); and</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(c)\" pID=\"p1_7-p2_c\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">whether this court should ratify the Disposition.</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It is interesting to note that in the court below, both the appellant and the respondent accepted <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> as being dispositive of the first issue above.

In 1977, a wife petitioned for divorce from her husband, with her claim for ancillary relief including a claim for a property adjustment order under s\u00a024 of the MCA 1973 transferring to her the jointly-owned matrimonial home. Negotiations between the parties resulted in a compromise of the wife\u2019s claim, and in December 1978, a consent court order was made pursuant to which the matrimonial home was to be sold and the wife was to be paid \u00a318,000 from the proceeds, with the balance to be divided equally between the husband and the wife. In May 1980, the husband was adjudicated bankrupt, and the trustee in bankruptcy asked the court for a declaration that the consent order was a settlement of \u00a39,000 by the bankrupt on the wife which was void against the trustee under s\u00a042 of the BA 1914. The County Court dismissed the application, holding that: (a)\u00a0the consent order was a settlement for the purposes of s\u00a042 of the BA 1914; but (b)\u00a0the wife was a purchaser for valuable consideration within the meaning of s\u00a042 of the BA 1914. Only the second holding was challenged on appeal to the Divisional Court, which dismissed the appeal.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"15\" pID=\"p1_15\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">After <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis> was decided and before <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> was decided, the UK Parliament introduced new bankruptcy legislation in the form of the IA 1986.

In <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis>, after a bankruptcy petition was presented against the husband and before the husband was adjudicated bankrupt, a consent court order was made in divorce proceedings, pursuant to s\u00a024 of the MCA 1973, ordering him to transfer his interest in the matrimonial home to the wife. Thereafter, the husband\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy sought, and was granted, a declaration that the order transferring the husband\u2019s interest in the matrimonial home was void under s\u00a0284(1) of the IA 1986 (\u201cs\u00a0284(1)\u201d). The wife appealed, and one of the grounds of appeal was that the consent court order was not, for the purposes of s\u00a0284(1), a \u201cdisposition of property\u201d by the person adjudged bankrupt (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the husband). Nicholas Stewart\u00a0QC (sitting as a deputy judge of the English High Court) disagreed and held that a transfer of property order made by a court under s\u00a024 of the MCA 1973 in respect of property held by a person against whom a bankruptcy petition had been presented was a \u201cdisposition of property\u201d by that person within the meaning of s\u00a0284(1).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The appellant argued that because the amended s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 (reproduced above at [16]) applied only to ss\u00a0339 and 340 of the IA 1986 and not also to s\u00a0284 of the IA 1986, Stewart\u00a0QC had to fill in a gap in the legislation by relying on the decision in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis>.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_7\">7</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_7\" label=\"7\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\"><Emphasis type=\"i\">Id</Emphasis> at para\u00a028.</Text></Para></Footnote> It is thus important, in assessing this particular argument, to refer to the relevant portion of Stewart\u00a0QC\u2019s reasoning <Emphasis type=\"i\">in extenso</Emphasis>, which was as follows (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> at 325\u2013326):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026 [The Divisional Court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis>] had to decide whether a wife in whose favour a property adjustment order had been made by consent under section\u00a024 of the [MCA] 1973 was a \u201cpurchaser for valuable consideration\u201d for the purposes of section\u00a042 of the [BA] 1914. If she was, that was an effective answer to what would otherwise have followed under section\u00a042, that the relevant part of the consent order would have been void against the trustee in bankruptcy because it had been made within two years of the husband\u2019s bankruptcy.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Section\u00a042 of the [BA 1914] was affected by a special provision in section\u00a039 of the [MCA 1973] which expressly provided that the fact that a settlement or transfer of property had to be made in order to comply with a property adjustment order should not prevent that settlement or transfer from being a settlement of property to which section\u00a042 applied. <Emphasis type=\"b\">Section\u00a039 is now applied, by amendment, to sections\u00a0339 and 340 of the [IA 1986] but has no equivalent so far as section\u00a0284 is concerned.</Emphasis></Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">Nevertheless, even allowing for that difference, it is worth noting that in [</Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"bi\">Abbott</Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">,] the judge had held that the consent order </Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"bi\">itself </Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">was a settlement for the purposes of section\u00a042. That conclusion was not challenged in the Divisional Court, where the appeal on the critical point, whether the wife was a purchaser for valuable consideration, simply proceeded on the assumption that it was correct.

But it does at least show that [the Divisional Court in </Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"bi\">Abbott</Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">] accepted, though without the benefit of any argument, as a reasonable proposition a conclusion which is essentially on all fours with the one that [counsel for the trustee in bankruptcy] is inviting me to reach in relation to section\u00a0284.</Emphasis> For a settlement to be void under section\u00a042 it was necessary for \u201cthe settlor\u201d to have become bankrupt within two years. Accordingly, for the court order to have been a settlement [for] the purposes of section\u00a042 it must have been a settlement by the bankrupt, since otherwise he could not have been the settlor and the section could have no application.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">If the relevant part of the court order in [</Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"bi\">Abbott</Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">] was a settlement for the purposes of section\u00a042, the relevant part of the Crewe order [</Emphasis>\n            <Emphasis type=\"bi\">ie</Emphasis>,<Emphasis type=\"bi\"/><Emphasis type=\"b\">the consent court order in </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">Flint</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"b\">], i.e.</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\"/><Emphasis type=\"b\">the part ordering transfer of [the husband\u2019s] interest in the [matrimonial home], would likewise be a disposition by [the husband].

That is a relatively straightforward example of equity treating as done that which ought to be done, the same principle by which a purchaser under a specifically enforceable contract acquires an equitable interest upon contract and before completion. What was treated as done in the present case was a transfer by [the husband] of all his interest in [the matrimonial home].</Emphasis></Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">This conclusion does not, I emphasise depend upon the Crewe order being a consent order. If the relevant parts of the order had been the result of a contested application my conclusion on this further point would have been exactly the same. As soon as the court makes its order, whether or not by consent, the transfer of property in accordance with the order becomes compulsory in a way that it was not immediately before the making of the order. But the fact that it is then compulsory</Emphasis>, and that in the case of a consent order any previous agreement between the parties is suspended, <Emphasis type=\"b\">does not in any way prevent its being a disposition by the owner of the property in question, in this case, [the husband]. It follows, therefore, that once [the husband] was adjudged bankrupt, the disposition of [the husband\u2019s] interest in the [matrimonial home] became void under s\u00a0284 unless subsequently ratified by the court \u2026</Emphasis></Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[original emphasis in bold italics; emphasis added in bold]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">A few points may be made in respect of the passage cited above. First, Stewart\u00a0QC expressly recognised that: (a)\u00a0the amended s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 applied only to ss\u00a0339 and 340 of the IA 1986, and there was no equivalent provision for s\u00a0284 of the IA 1986; and (b)\u00a0the decision in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis> was not binding on him. Secondly, any support that Stewart\u00a0QC was seeking to obtain from <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis> related to the holding of the County Court at first instance, and the assumption of the Divisional Court on appeal, that \u201cthe consent order <Emphasis type=\"i\">itself</Emphasis> was a settlement for the purposes of section\u00a042 [of the BA 1914]\u201d [emphasis in original] (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> at 326). This is to be contrasted with s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 (in both its original and its amended versions), which clarifies that <Emphasis type=\"i\">a settlement or transfer of property that had to be made in order to comply with a property adjustment order</Emphasis> can nonetheless be subject to the relevant provision(s) of bankruptcy legislation. Thirdly, after considering the decision in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis>, Stewart\u00a0QC proceeded to reason from first principles (and without relying on either <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis> or s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973) to conclude that the consent court order in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> was a disposition by the husband within the meaning of s\u00a0284(1) despite the fact that the transfer of property in accordance with the order was compulsory. It is therefore not accurate for the appellant to argue that Stewart\u00a0QC relied either on s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973, or on parts of the decision in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis> which relied on that provision to arrive at his decision.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"20\" pID=\"p1_20\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">That the appellant incorrectly identified s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 as the reason for the decisions in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis> and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> is apparent from the subsequent decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Treharne and another v Forrester</Emphasis> [2003] EWHC 2784 (Ch) (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Treharne v Forrester</Emphasis>\u201d), where the English High Court applied the rule in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> on very similar facts <Emphasis type=\"i\">without</Emphasis> considering s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 and the fact that it did not apply to s\u00a0284 of the IA 1986. For the above reasons, contrary to the appellant\u2019s contention, the absence of a Singapore equivalent of s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 is <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> \u201can <Emphasis type=\"i\">overwhelming</Emphasis> ground\u201d<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_8\">8</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_8\" label=\"8\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\"><Emphasis type=\"i\">Id</Emphasis> at para\u00a023.</Text></Para></Footnote> [emphasis in original] for arguing against the applicability of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> in Singapore.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"21\" pID=\"p1_21\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">With regard to the appellant\u2019s second argument that as a matter of statutory interpretation, s\u00a077(1) does not apply to a disposition pursuant to a court order (see [10] above), the appellant made the following points. First, the words \u201cdisposition of property <Emphasis type=\"i\">made by him</Emphasis>\u201d [emphasis added] (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the person who is adjudged bankrupt) in s\u00a077(1) suggest that this provision applies only to voluntary dispositions.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_9\">9</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_9\" label=\"9\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\"><Emphasis type=\"i\">Id</Emphasis> at para\u00a045.</Text></Para></Footnote> Secondly, the appellant submitted that the fact that the UK Parliament saw the need to enact s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 to make it clear that a transfer of property in compliance with a property adjustment order was caught by bankruptcy legislation was \u201ca clear recognition\u201d<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_10\">10</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_10\" label=\"10\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\"><Emphasis type=\"i\">Id</Emphasis> at para\u00a046.</Text></Para></Footnote> that but for s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973, a disposition under a court order was not one made by the bankrupt.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"22\" pID=\"p1_22\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The appellant\u2019s argument, in essence, is that a disposition pursuant to a court order is not one made by the person to whom the court order is directed. This argument has been made on several occasions (including, as noted above, in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis>) without success. In this regard, we respectfully adopt the following analysis of the court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Treharne v Forrester</Emphasis> (at [49]\u2013[53]) on the issue of who the disponor is when there is a disposition in the form of a property adjustment court order:</Text>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>49</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026 If the property adjustment order was a disposition, \u2026 then if it was not made by the debtor, who was it made by? It cannot have been made by the Court; the [C]ourt had no legal or equitable interest in the property then disposed of. How could the court dispose of it; <Emphasis type=\"i\">nemo dat quod non habet</Emphasis>. Surely only a person having a legal or equitable interest in the property disposed of could have made the disposition. That points to the husband as disponor and rules out the Court as being disponor.</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>50</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[Counsel for the wife], though, says that disposition which he accepts was made was made by operation of law. I am far from sure that that, of itself, denies the disposition as being made by the person adjudged bankrupt, albeit by operation of law, the law operating, so to speak, upon him.</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>51</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">There is, of course, \u2026 a disposition by operation of law under s\u00a0306 of the [IA 1986] when the property of the bankrupt vests in the trustee in bankruptcy. There is in that case express statutory provision that the vesting takes place without any conveyance, assignment or transfer. In such a case statute makes it quite plain that what takes place could not fairly be described as a disposition by the bankrupt. It does not follow from the fact that one can, under a statutory express provision, have a form of disposition which is attributable to no individual person as the maker of the disposition, that a disposition made by way of Court order but without any equivalent statutory provision as to the absence of need for a conveyance, assignment or transfer is either a disposition made by operation of law in the strict sense or is made by no person.</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>52</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It would be reasonable, it seems to me, for Parliament specifically to have overcome the ordinary common sense exemplified in the \u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">nemo dat</Emphasis>\u201d principle had it been intended to do so. I therefore do attach weight to the simple view that if there is a disposition here, \u2026 then who could it have been made by if not by the husband?</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>53</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">A further consideration is this. The [<Emphasis type=\"i\">Mountney v Treharne</Emphasis> [2003] Ch 135] and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> cases are both examples of the equitable doctrine of taking as done that which ought to have been done. What is it, therefore, upon the making of the property adjustment order that ought to have been done? The answer surely is a disposition <Emphasis type=\"i\">by the husband</Emphasis>. The [court] orders contemplate no other disponor. To apply the maxim and accept, therefore that there ought to have been, and therefore, in the eye[s] of the law, has been a disposition does not go far enough. The very same maxim goes on to identify the disponor as the husband. It is he that ought to have made the disposition made by the [court] orders in the wife\u2019s favour. \u2026</Text>\n          </Item>\n        </QuoteList>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[emphasis in original]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In arriving at its conclusion, the court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Treharne v Forrester</Emphasis> did not have to rely on s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973. In the present case, the ICJ may have been the <Emphasis type=\"i\">means</Emphasis> by which the Disposition was made, but the Disposition was nonetheless made, in our view, <Emphasis type=\"i\">by the Bankrupt</Emphasis>.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The common law position is therefore clear: a court order requiring a transfer of property is a disposition, and it is a disposition made by the person to whom the court order is directed. All s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 did, therefore, was to <Emphasis type=\"i\">clarify, rather than to effect a substantive change in the law as such</Emphasis>. This was recognised by Peter Gibson\u00a0J in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Abbott</Emphasis> itself, where he observed (at 54) that s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 put to rest any doubt that might have arisen on the matter:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026 The wording of [s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973] seems to me designed to put beyond doubt that which otherwise might have been in doubt. In the absence of the section it might have been thought that section\u00a042(1) [of the BA 1914] might not apply to a settlement or transfer made pursuant to an order of the court, particularly when the debtor himself could not impugn the settlement or transfer. Section\u00a039 makes clear that the mere fact that there has been a court order does not prevent any such transfer or settlement from being challenged by the trustee under section\u00a042(1). \u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"25\" pID=\"p1_25\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The same conclusion may also be arrived at from a reading of s\u00a077(1), both alone as well as in the context of the Act. The word \u201cdisposition\u201d is defined in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary</Emphasis> (Bryan A\u00a0Garner chief ed) (West Publishing Co, 9th\u00a0Ed, 2009) at p\u00a0539 as \u201c(t)he act of transferring something to another\u2019s care or possession, esp. by deed or will; the relinquishing of property\u201d. This definition suggests that a \u201cdisposition\u201d in the context of s\u00a077(1) need only entail an act of transfer effected by (here) the Bankrupt. Indeed, other definitions of the word \u201cdisposition\u201d appear to furnish even stronger support for the approach which we have adopted in the present appeal. In <Emphasis type=\"i\">Jowitt\u2019s Dictionary of English Law</Emphasis> (Daniel Greenberg gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd\u00a0Ed, 2010), for example, the word \u201cdisposition\u201d is defined as follows (at vol\u00a01, p\u00a0726):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">Disposition.</Emphasis> (1)\u00a0The passing of property to another party, <Emphasis type=\"i\">whether by act of the parties or by operation of law</Emphasis>.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(3)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For statutory definitions and judicial constructions in various contexts, see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary</Emphasis>.</Text>\n          </Item>\n        </QuoteList>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[emphasis added]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"26\" pID=\"p1_26\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">And, in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases</Emphasis> (Daniel Greenberg gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th\u00a0Ed, 2012), the word \u201cdisposition\u201d is elaborated upon thus (at vol\u00a01, pp\u00a0800\u2013801):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"b\">DISPOSITION.</Emphasis> \u201cThe terms \u2018disposition\u2019 and \u2018devolution\u2019 must have been intended to comprehend and exhaust every conceivable mode by which property can pass, whether by act of parties or by act of the law\u201d (per Lord\u00a0Macnaghten, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Northumberland v Att-Gen</Emphasis> [1905] A.C. 406 \u2026). \u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">An order made by the court under s.24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c.18), ordering the transfer of property by a person against whom a bankruptcy petition had been presented, was a \u201cdisposition\u201d by the bankrupt and void under s.284 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c.45) (<Emphasis type=\"i\">Re Flint (a Bankrupt)</Emphasis> [1993] 2\u00a0W.L.R. 53).</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We also note that the word \u201cdisposition\u201d is used in contradistinction to the word \u201csale\u201d in various provisions of the Act (see, for example, ss\u00a0123(3), 123A(5) and 128(2)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">b</Emphasis>) of the Act), indicating that the word \u201cdisposition\u201d as used in the Act captures both personal as well as court-ordered dispositions. Further, if the appellant\u2019s submission is accepted, a disposition during the Relevant Period pursuant to an out-of-court settlement of a dispute would be caught by s\u00a077(1), but if the terms of settlement are recorded as a consent court order instead, a disposition pursuant to such an order would not be so caught. We see no logical basis whatsoever for distinguishing between these two scenarios. This is especially so in the light of the line of decisions from this court holding that a liquidator (and, by analogy, an Official Assignee) may go behind court orders, which are open to scrutiny during liquidation and bankruptcy, respectively.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"28\" pID=\"p1_28\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We now turn to the appellant\u2019s third argument (see [10] above), <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, that the proper statutory provision to use to invalidate the Disposition is s\u00a073B of the CLPA, and not s\u00a077(1) (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, s\u00a077(1) of the Act). Section\u00a073B of the CLPA reads as follows:</Text>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"hanging\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(1)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Except as provided in this section, every conveyance of property \u2026 with intent to defraud creditors, shall be voidable, at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced.</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(2)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This section does not affect the law relating to bankruptcy for the time being in force.</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(3)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This section does not extend to any estate or interest in property disposed of for valuable consideration and in good faith or upon good consideration and in good faith to any person not having, at the time of the disposition, notice of the intent to defraud creditors.</Text>\n          </Item>\n        </QuoteList>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"29\" pID=\"p1_29\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Section\u00a073B(2) of the CLPA makes it clear that the section is meant to operate <Emphasis type=\"i\">independent of</Emphasis> bankruptcy law. Therefore, the appellant\u2019s argument, which is an attempt to use s\u00a073B of the CLPA to limit the scope of s\u00a077(1), cannot be accepted. The mere fact that s\u00a073B(1) of the CLPA may be applicable in this case does not \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 render s\u00a077(1) inapplicable.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"30\" pID=\"p1_30\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In summary, s\u00a077(1) applies to a disposition of property pursuant to a court order. This conclusion is consistent with the wording and philosophy of s\u00a077(1) in particular and the Act in general, as well as with logic and common sense. It is also the position at common law as set out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Flint</Emphasis> and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Treharne v Forrester</Emphasis>, decisions which were not based on s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973 and which are applicable in this case. There is therefore no need for the existence of a separate statutory provision (such as s\u00a039 of the MCA 1973) in order to clarify that this is the position.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"31\" pID=\"p1_31\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the reasons set out above, we dismissed the appeal with costs.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"32\" pID=\"p1_32\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This appeal also serves as a reminder that it is prudent for parties to a litigation to conduct the relevant bankruptcy searches before the commencement of proceedings.

class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"/>1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is an appeal against the decision of a High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) affirming the decision of a liquidator to reject a proof of debt lodged against a company in members\u2019 voluntary liquidation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"/>2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appellant is Fustar Chemicals Ltd (Hong Kong) (\u201cFCL\u201d), the plaintiff below. The respondent is Ms\u00a0Ong Soo Hwa (\u201cOSH\u201d), the liquidator of Fustar Chemicals Pte Ltd (the \u201cCompany\u201d). FCL filed a proof of debt on 18\u00a0November 2005 for $614,560.71 but this proof was rejected by OSH on 3\u00a0July 2007 on the basis of insufficient evidence. In Originating Summons No\u00a01088 of 2007 filed on 23\u00a0July 2007, FCL applied pursuant to r\u00a093 of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap\u00a050, R\u00a01, 2006\u00a0Rev Ed) to reverse the decision of OSH not to admit the proof of debt submitted by FCL and for FCL\u2019s proof of debt to be admitted in full. We now set out the pertinent facts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"/>3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company was incorporated in Singapore on 30\u00a0July 1987 with an issued and paid up-capital of 5,000 ordinary shares of $1 each. From financial year (\u201cFY\u201d) 1997 to FY\u00a01999, Wong Ser Wan (\u201cWSW\u201d) was the sole shareholder of the Company. From FY\u00a02000 to FY\u00a02004, WSW held 4,998 shares; WSW\u2019s ex-husband Ng Cheong Ling (\u201cNCL\u201d) held one share; and their daughter, Ng Eharn (\u201cNE\u201d), also held one share. It bears mention that there is no evidence on record (nor has it been suggested otherwise in submissions) that either WSW or NE made any payments for their shares. At the point of winding up, the Company\u2019s only directors were NE and WSW. They passed a special resolution for the Company to be placed under Members\u2019 voluntary liquidation on 24\u00a0July 2004 as a solvent company. OSH was appointed the liquidator by WSW and NE at the same extraordinary general meeting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"/>4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FCL was incorporated in Hong Kong and was in the business of selling (mainly) paraffin wax obtained from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d). Its shareholders were another Hong Kong company, Dynamic Pacific Ltd (9,999 shares out of a total of 10,000) and NCL\u2019s brother, Ng Cheong Bian (one share). FCL was part of a group of companies with trade links to China that were controlled by the Ng family. It was represented in Singapore by NCL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"/>5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company\u2019s primary business was that of an intermediary between FCL in Hong Kong and customers in Taiwan and South Africa. During that period, China had banned the sale of paraffin wax to Taiwan and South Africa. Goodwood Ltd, a company belonging to the same group of companies controlled by the Ng family, would buy paraffin wax from Chinese companies and sell them to Goodray Ltd, another Ng family controlled company. Goodray Ltd would in turn sell the paraffin wax to FCL which then resold them to the Company. FCL was the point of contact with customers in Taiwan and South Africa, but the actual sale and collection of revenue was made through the Company. In other words, the Company was mainly responsible for collecting debts that were in reality owed to FCL. It can be said that it discharged the role of a facilitator rather than that of a real trading company. There has been no suggestion by OSH that any of these arrangements offended the laws of Singapore. It is also not disputed that NCL was both the directing and controlling mind behind both FCL and the Company during the relevant trading period. WSW was, at all times, a homemaker and had neither any interest nor involvement in the business. According to NCL, the Company\u2019s business activities stopped in 1997 when the relationship between NCL and WSW became intractable. This has not been disputed by either WSW or OSH.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"/>6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCL and WSW were married in 1976 but the marriage began to sour in 1993. WSW eventually filed a divorce petition in October 1996. The divorce proceedings were both protracted and acrimonious and resulted in several different lawsuits between NCL and WSW as well as the companies controlled by them. A <em>decree nisi</em> was finally granted in 2000. A detailed history of their legal skirmishes can be found in the case report of the ancillary proceedings in <em>Wong Ser Wan v Ng Cheong Ling</em> <nobr>[2006] 1 SLR 416</nobr>. We note that the Judge attached some significance to the finding in those proceedings that NCL had attempted to dissipate his assets to reduce the pool of matrimonial assets available for division. In <em>Wong Ser Wan v Ng Bok Eng Holdings Pte Ltd</em> <nobr>[2004] 4 SLR 365</nobr> (\u201c<em>Ng Bok Eng Holdings</em>\u201d), Judith Prakash\u00a0J allowed WSW\u2019s claim that a series of property transfers by NCL to other related companies were in fact fraudulent conveyances. In due course, in 2002, NCL was made a bankrupt for failing to satisfy the judgment in another case involving Aromate Ltd, a company in which WSW was a shareholder and NCL a director. He currently remains an undischarged bankrupt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"/>7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The directors of the Company, WSW and NE, filed a Declaration of Solvency on 7\u00a0July 2004 (\u201cthe Declaration of Solvency\u201d)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a id=\"Ftn_1_1\" href=\"#Ftn_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> affirming that its assets exceeded its liabilities. The Declaration of Solvency further stated it was a true and correct statement of the company\u2019s assets and liabilities as at 31\u00a0March 2004. It listed under the Liabilities column \u201ctrade accounts\u201d a sum of $691,088 owing to unsecured creditors. The individual identities of these unsecured creditors were however not disclosed. WSW and NE eventually passed a special resolution on 26\u00a0July 2004 to wind up the company. We pause here to make, what is in our view, a crucial observation. While FCL is the major creditor of the Company, WSW is on the flip side its major debtor. The Declaration of Solvency records the amount due from one of the Company\u2019s director as $857,222. Counsel for OSH clarified at the hearing of this appeal in response to a query from us that this debt was actually due from WSW. It is not clear from the documents filed when and how WSW withdrew this amount from the Company. However, as the amount is not in dispute, we need say no more. What is material for the purposes of these proceedings is to point out that the amount due from WSW to the Company substantially exceeds the claim of FCL. It also bears mention that there is no evidence before us that this debt has been paid by WSW or collected by OSH. <em>This state of affairs could give rise to the perception that OSH regarded her principal role as liquidator was to search for reasons to reject the proof of debt filed by FCL</em>. We now turn to examine the basis for FCL\u2019s proof of debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The proof of debt</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"/>8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FCL submitted a proof of debt (\u201cFCL\u2019s debt\u201d) in December 2005 for the sum of HKD2,832,891.04 (equivalent to $614,560.71) which it claimed was a debt incurred by the Company since 1988 for goods supplied. FCL was then invited by OSH to provide supporting evidence in the form of invoices, purchase orders, delivery orders, shipping documents and other relevant documents. However, all FCL could submit as proof of its claim were the following supporting documents: (a)\u00a0copies of audit confirmations from the Company for FY\u00a01997 to FY\u00a02001; (b)\u00a0copies of FCL\u2019s own audited accounts for FY\u00a02000; and (c)\u00a0copies of ledger entries of the Company for FY\u00a01995 to FY\u00a01999. The audit confirmations signed by WSW acknowledged that in FY\u00a01997, the Company owed FCL a sum of $2,615,269.56. This sum was reduced by $582,537.21 in FY\u00a01998. Finally, in FY\u00a01999, an audit confirmation also signed by WSW recorded the sum of $614,560.71 (<em>ie</em>, the sum of FCL\u2019s debt). Each of these figures was matched by ledger entries made during the relevant accounting period. FCL\u2019s own audited accounts for FY\u00a02000 recorded that the Company owed FCL a debt of HKD2,832,891 (equivalent to FCL\u2019s debt). FCL claimed that the primary documents were no longer available. Under Hong Kong law, it was only obliged to keep the documents and records for seven years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"/>9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other than these materials, OSH also had the benefit of evaluating the Company\u2019s audited financial statements from FY\u00a01997 to FY\u00a02003. These audited financial statements recorded the total debt the Company owed without detailing the individual trade creditors. The FY\u00a01997 audited financial statement recorded the Company\u2019s debt to trade creditors as $2,663,520. By FY\u00a01998 this figure had been reduced to $634,389. In FY\u00a01999, the Company\u2019s debt to trade creditors increased marginally to $691,088. This amount remained constant in the audited financial statements of FY\u00a02000 to FY\u00a02003. The auditors for the Company were originally Chan &amp; Chan Certified Public Accounts (\u201cC&amp;C\u201d) for FY\u00a01997 to FY\u00a01998. After WSW commenced divorce proceedings, Goh Boon Kok &amp; Co (\u201cGBK\u201d) were appointed as auditors of the Company by her. They took over the auditing of the Company\u2019s accounts from FY\u00a01999 onwards. A qualification was subsequently inserted in all of the following years\u2019 audited financial statements to the effect that GBK had not received independent confirmation of the trade balance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"/>10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OSH rejected FCL\u2019s proof of debt on 3\u00a0July 2007. The following reasons were given:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"/>(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FCL was a related company and OSH considered it necessary to look behind the acknowledgment of debt between the parties;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"/>(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Company\u2019s auditors, GBK, qualified the accounts from FY 1999 to FY 2003 because it could not obtain independent confirmation of trade creditors, directors, shareholders and related party balances;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"/>(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FCL\u2019s own audited financial statements contained a disclaimer that the auditors could not form an opinion on the accounts for that year, and a provision for doubtful debt for the amount had been made since at least 31\u00a0December 1999;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"/>(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other than the ledger entries, there were no primary supporting documents for FCL\u2019s claim;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_e\"/>(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0no reason was given by FCL as to why the debt was allowed to remain outstanding for such a long period; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_f\"/>(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the interviews with NCL, WSW and another unrelated ex-director of the company, Mr\u00a0Ng Chan Ho, were inconclusive as they were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation of the primary transactions underlying the trade debts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The decision below</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"/>11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only issue before the High Court was whether, on a balance of probabilities, FCL\u2019s debt was a valid or invalid debt. Opinions of expert witnesses were extensively canvassed by both parties. Timothy Reid, for FCL, unsurprisingly opined that he would have accepted the existing documentary evidence as proof of debt in the absence of contradictory evidence. Timothy Reid views were not tested by cross-examination. On the other hand, Tam Chee Chong (\u201cTam\u201d), the expert witness for OSH, who had earlier assisted her in evaluating the validity of the proof of debt, took the view that the Company\u2019s accounts called for an explanation which was not forthcoming; therefore OSH was justified in her rejection of the proof of debt. Tam had earlier interviewed the auditors C&amp;C and GBK. He ascertained that both C&amp;C and GBK relied on NCL for information and documents on audit matters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"/>12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Judge agreed with OSH\u2019s decision and rejected FCL\u2019s application to admit the debt in full. In her view, the actual liabilities between the Company and FCL could not be accurately or completely ascertained because of the lack of primary accounting documents. The absence of these documents, she pointed out, had materially affected the decision of the second auditor GBK to insert the qualification in the audited financial statements that he was unable to obtain independent confirmation of the Company\u2019s trade balance. Any reasonable person in the position of OSH, put on notice by the qualification, would carry out other checks and enquiries to substantiate the balance (see <em>Fustar Chemicals Ltd v Liquidator of Fustar Chemicals Pte Ltd</em> <nobr>[2008] SGHC 198</nobr> (\u201cGD\u201d) at [40]). The Judge also noted that the only source of the auditors\u2019 information was NCL, and it would be \u201cimprudent\u201d (GD at [41]) to accept NCL\u2019s testimony at face value because of his past conduct \u2013 FCL and the Company were part of a web of companies that NCL used for his personal benefit. Lastly, the Judge appeared to have discounted Timothy Reid\u2019s opinion on the ground that it was contrary to the position in law. Why this was the case is not apparent from the grounds of decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">An overview of a liquidator\u2019s duty in assessing a proof of debt</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"/>13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The established principles of law are not disputed in the present case. In the winding up of a solvent company, the unsecured assets of the company will ordinarily be applied <em>pari passu</em> in satisfaction of its liabilities (subject to any preferential payments) and the surplus distributed among its members. The duty to pay the company\u2019s debts resides with the liquidator, who may exercise powers given to a liquidator in a winding up by the court as provided under s\u00a0305 Companies Act, Cap\u00a050 2006\u00a0Rev Ed. In a winding up, a creditor bears the burden of proving the debt on a balance of probabilities (see <em>Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell</em> <nobr>[1997] 142 FLR 137</nobr> and <em>The Trustee in Bankruptcy of Lo Siu Fai Louis v Toohey</em> <nobr>[2005] 4 HKC 51</nobr>). The liquidator must assess every proof of debt lodged and may call for further evidence in support of the claim. In considering a proof, the liquidator is not bound by the audited accounts or audit confirmations entered into by the company, and is entitled to go behind them to determine the veracity of the debt claimed (<em>In re Van Laun, ex p Pattulo</em> [1907] 1\u00a0KB 155 at 162; <em>Re Ice-Mack Pte Ltd; AA Valibhoy &amp; Sons (1907) Pte Ltd v Official Receiver</em> <nobr>[1989] SLR 876</nobr> (\u201c<em>Re Ice-Mack</em>\u201d)).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"/>14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These principles apply to the winding up of both solvent and insolvent companies. In <em>Re Menastar Finance Ltd (in liq.), Menastar Ltd v Simon</em> <nobr>[2003] 1 BCLC 338</nobr> (a case of an insolvent company), Etherton\u00a0J said the liquidator has a duty to \u201censure that the assets of the <em>insolvent</em> company \u2018are distributed amongst those who are justly, legally and properly creditors \u2026\u2019\u201d [emphasis added] at [46]. Only the <em>true</em> liabilities of a company should be met. This principle had been earlier clarified by the High Court of Australia in <em>Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O\u2019Brien</em> (1990) 169\u00a0CLR 332 at [184]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As the parties whose interests are affected by admission of a proof of debt are the general body of creditors and contributories rather than the company in liquidation, there are some liabilities which would be enforceable against the company but which a liquidator is not bound to admit to proof of debt lest the interests of creditors and the contributories may be unjustly affected. A liquidator may openly reject a proof of debt if the liability, though enforceable against the company, is not a true liability of the company but is found merely on some act or omission on the part of the company which unjustly prejudices the interests of the creditors or contributories in the assets available for distribution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"/>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>, a proof of debt was lodged against a company that had been compulsorily wound up. The creditor and the debtor company were \u2018associated\u2019 in that one person, Mr\u00a0Valibhoy, controlled both. Although the creditor\u2019s own audited financial statements were provided, pertinently, the statements did not attest to any debt owed by the company at all. All that was shown was that Mr\u00a0Valibhoy himself owed a debt to the creditor. Mr\u00a0Valibhoy tried to explain that, in reality, he had agreed to bear the debt that was originally incurred by the company personally so that the creditor would not be put to loss as a result of the company\u2019s winding up. This reason was rejected by the court because Mr\u00a0Valibhoy\u2019s debt to the creditor was incurred before the company was wound up. Further, the company\u2019s own audited accounts did not lend any support to the existence of the alleged debt. Instead, the only documentary evidence in support of the proof of debt was a solitary audit confirmation by the debtor company signed by Mr\u00a0Valibhoy himself, the same person controlling both debtor and creditor. Unsurprisingly, in light of the conflicting accounts stated and the close relationship between the parties, the audit confirmation was rejected by the High Court as sufficient evidence of the debt. Yong Pung How\u00a0J, as he then was, observed at [11]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In anything resembling an arms-length situation, an audit confirmation would of course be strong evidence against a party of the correctness of the credit or debit balance which it has confirmed. This particular confirmation was signed on behalf of the company, however, by Mr\u00a0Valibhoy and, in all the circumstances, unless it was corroborated by other more independent evidence, could not be accepted as evidence of the debt which it purported to confirm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It appeared to the court that Mr\u00a0Valibhoy was attempting to secure a claim at the expense of other legitimate creditors. Given the absence of any primary supporting documents, the presence of worrying discrepancies in the creditors\u2019 own audited accounts and Mr\u00a0Valibhoy\u2019s own contradictory explanations, the court unhesitatingly rejected the proof of debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"/>16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In <em>Re Adam Holdings Ltd</em> <nobr>[1985] 2 HKC 608</nobr> (\u201c<em>Re Adam Holdings</em>\u201d), a creditor which was the subsidiary of a company that was also compulsorily wound up submitted a proof of debt to the Official Receiver. The proof was supported by ledger entries of the group of companies as well as a draft account sent to the creditor by the debtor company, prepared by accountants, to confirm the balance due. No audited statements were produced, and the primary supporting documents were lost. Jones\u00a0J found that the ledger entries were riddled with discrepancies. Records of payments made to the debtor company were also produced as evidence of the debt. However, these records of payments received by the debtor company did not reflect a debt to the applicant creditor. Instead, they painted a completely different picture; the records of payment showed that the wound up company owed debts to other parties. In the result, the proof of debt was rejected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"/>17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, in <em>Capital Realty Pte Ltd v Chip Thye Enterprises (Pte) Ltd</em> <nobr>[2000] 4 SLR 548</nobr> (\u201c<em>Capital Realty</em>\u201d), Chao Hick Tin\u00a0J held that an audit confirmation was <em>prima facie</em> evidence of debt. He distinguished <em>Re Ice-Mack</em> as being \u201cwholly inapplicable\u201d (at [30]) since there were no circumstances warranting suspicion on the signing of the audit confirmation despite the close friendship of the debtor and creditor. Unlike both <em>Re Adam Holdings Ltd</em> and <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>, there were no discrepancies in the record of debts in any of the audited accounts. This case can more properly be classified as an \u201carms-length transaction\u201d unlike the case of <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"/>18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, the Hong Kong High Court in <em>Grand Gain Investment Ltd v Cosimo Borrelli</em> <nobr>[2006] HKCU 872</nobr> (unreported) (\u201c<em>Grand Gain Investment</em>\u201d) distinguished <em>Re Adam Holdings</em> on the basis that the accounts in the latter case were audited. In <em>Grand Gain Investment</em>, a creditor filed proofs of debt against three companies accompanied by a copy of the audited accounts of the companies concerned. The creditor held shares, either directly or indirectly, in all three companies. One of the creditor\u2019s directors gave evidence to explain the accounts and any differences therein. Barma\u00a0J held at [18]\u2013[19] that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">While it is no doubt correct to say that the court is not bound to accept the accounts of a company at face value, it seems to me that, nonetheless, weight should be given to the fact that the accounts in question have been audited, a process which requires the auditor to satisfy himself that the accounts provide a true and fair view of the company\u2019s financial position. Where there is evidence to show that the accounts are, or may be, inaccurate, or to cast doubt on the way in which the auditor carried out his duties, this will be a factor to take into account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">However, it seems to me that there is no evidence before me on which I could conclude that the audited accounts which have been put forward may be (still less, are) inaccurate or incorrect. The position here is rather different in this respect from that in either <em>Re Adam Holdings</em> or <em>Louis Lo v Toohey</em>. In <em>Re Adam Holdings</em>, it is not clear whether the court was considering audited accounts of the company, or ledgers which had been written up by its auditors. Nonetheless, it is clear from Jones J\u2019s summary of the evidence in relation to the various advances relied on in that case (at pages 610G to 612A of the judgment) that such evidence indicated that the advances were not made by the applicants in that case, but by other companies or entities associated with it. In those circumstances, it is not surprising that Jones J did not think it right to rely on accounts which suggested that the loans had been made by the applicant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">It seems to us that the overriding concern of the courts in all the above cases was to ensure that that legitimate creditors and contributories of a company should not be prejudiced by spurious claims made by related parties under the guise of being creditors. What is spurious would depend on the facts of each case. The principle that can also be gleaned from this brief overview is that the duty of the liquidator in assessing a proof of debt is to ensure that while genuine debts are admitted and false claims are rejected, he must act <em>fairly</em> in discharging his duties. He must, at all times, be independent and hold an even hand in dealing with the often competing interests of creditors, contributories and his appointers. <em>A liquidator must never favour the interests of his appointers over that of the other legitimate claimants to the company\u2019s assets</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Our decision</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"/>19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The main issue in this appeal simply boils down to this: whether the liquidator ought to have accepted the proof of debt as supported by the various documents tendered without more. In this case, we have a running account that the Company\u2019s directors and shareholders had unequivocally accepted as correct between 1988 and 2000 (see <a href=\"#p1_8\">[8]</a> above). It is, in these circumstances, that the question of whether FCL\u2019s proof of debt is genuine or false should be approached by the liquidator and taking into account the reasons why FCL was not able to produce the supporting primary documents that OSH required.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The extent of a liquidator\u2019s duty in relation to the verification of a proof of debt</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"/>20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The verification of a proof of debt is not a mere administrative function. Only debts that are legally due are admissible. The liquidator has to ensure that the assets of the company are only distributed to creditors who have debts that have been genuinely created and remain legally due. He has extensive powers to go behind documents. Even judgments and compromise agreements can be re-evaluated to ensure that the debts are genuine. That said, a liquidator must have a reasonable basis on which to query a debt that appears to be genuine. Although a liquidator \u201cis not bound to admit\u201d any proof of debt which, if admitted, would affect the interests of creditors and contributories, he <em>is</em> only bound to take extraordinary steps to scrutinise a proof of debt on the basis that it could be a false claim in cases where he has reason to be suspicious about its genuineness or legal validity. Factors to be considered include, <em>inter alia</em>, the origins of the debt, the length of time the debt has been due, how the company has treated the debt in its financial statements, the business of the debtor company and, where relevant, the relationships between the claimants and the controlling shareholders of the company. In assessing these factors, the liquidator must rely on: (a)\u00a0knowledge of the general principles of company accounting; (b)\u00a0the auditing practice of companies by independent auditors; (c)\u00a0the effect and implication of directors\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 approvals annually of company accounts made in compliance with the law; (d)\u00a0the customary insolvency practice in verifying debts; and (e)\u00a0some degree of common sense in understanding human relationships. In taking into account these matters, he should also apprise himself of the nature of the business of the company, and other facts peculiar to the company in liquidation. In the case of the present company, the relationship between the directors and the shareholders, <em>inter se</em>, is obviously a relevant factor to be considered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"/>21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, although a liquidator has a duty to scrutinise all proofs of debt, the level of scrutiny required by the liquidator to discharge this duty must, in the final analysis, depend on the circumstances of the case. In the present case, OSH rejected FCL\u2019s proof only because it could not produce the related primary documents, even though FCL had explained that they had been destroyed or lost due to effluxion of time. This was not an unbelievable reason since the claimed debt was originally acknowledged by the Company as far back as January 1995, more than 9 years before the Company was wound up. OSH was aware that under Hong Kong law, FCL was not obliged to preserve indefinitely the related documents concerning a debt due to the Company (which is, in any case, from a related company or at least part of a group of companies controlled by NCL and his family). OSH was also aware that FCL\u2019s proof of debt was a debt that the Company itself had consistently acknowledged as owing in its own annual accounts, which had been approved by the WSW <em>qua</em> director and shareholder. In our view, although a liquidator has the power to look behind the audited financial statements and audit confirmations, a creditor\u2019s proof of debt should not be lightly rejected if the debt has been consistently acknowledged in audited accounts and or through audit confirmation statements. Such acknowledgments amount to an admission of the debt. Furthermore, a long effluxion of time inevitably creates evidential difficulties, as in the present case. Witnesses may be difficult to locate or may not be able to recollect essential details, and some may even become uncooperative. The relevant primary documents can also be destroyed or lost through the passage of time. In essence, while we accept that the burden of proof ordinarily rests on the creditor to substantiate a proof of debt this does not mean that the only means by which a creditor can prove a proof of debt must be through the production of primary documents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>A liquidator must not only act independently but be seen to do so</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"/>22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All liquidators have to uncompromisingly observe their obligations to maintain independence and act fairly regardless of the manner of their appointment and the identity of their appointer. For instance, in a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator must act independently, and not be open to influence from the appointing directors, especially when any of them has a vested interest in <em>denying</em> creditors their proofs of debt. In our opinion, OSH actions herein could be perceived as a failure to maintain independence and to act fairly. Here, WSW had previously taken out most of the surplus assets (see above at <a href=\"#p1_7\">[7]</a>). She now owes at least $857,222 to the Company. OSH has taken no steps to either collect this amount or to satisfactorily secure it. It is plain that if FCL\u2019s proof of debt were to be accepted, OSH would then have no alternative but to take steps to recover this substantial debt due to the Company from her true appointer. On the other hand, if OSH\u2019s decision were allowed to stand, the only person to benefit from it would be WSW.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"/>23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, having regard to the factors we have identified, the context in which FCL\u2019s proof of debt (in respect of a longstanding and consistently acknowledged debt) was rejected gives rise to real concerns as to whether OSH had gone out of her way to reject it on the mere basis that the primary documents relating to the debt could not be produced, and simply because the law conferred on her the power to do so. Given the original spousal relationship between WSW and NCL, and how the Company came to be involved in the trading outside Singapore, we find it difficult, if not impossible, to believe that WSW (as a director and a shareholder) did not know or accept that FCL\u2019s debt had been properly incurred, as confirmed by the approved annual accounts over many years. In rejecting FCL\u2019s debts, OSH did not appear to have directed her mind to all these relevant factors that we have mentioned earlier (above at <a href=\"#p1_20\">[20]</a>). <em>Her failure to do so has created real doubts in our mind about her independence of action</em>. Instead, she appears to have made strenuous efforts to reject the proof of debt, such as by her misplaced reliance on FCL\u2019s directors having characterised in their books the claim against the Company as a doubtful debt (see 10(c) above). It must have been obvious to anyone with an accounting background that doubtfulness about the collectability of a debt by a creditor has no effect on a legal obligation to make payment by the debtor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>OSH acted in excess of her duties</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"/>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The primary reasons for holding an inquiry have been amply set out in the Judge\u2019s decision below, as well as the findings of Tam and OSH herself. Substantially, the Judge below as well as the liquidator, OSH, thought that the transactions between FCL and the Company were not at arms length because one person, NCL, was the controlling mind of both FCL and the Company at the same time. This was exemplified by the prevalence of related party balances on the balance sheets of the companies (see GD at [41]). This, the Judge agreed, was especially troubling because the Company\u2019s auditors for the financial statements for FY\u00a01999 to FY\u00a02003 (after divorce proceedings had been initiated), GBK, added a qualification that it could not obtain independent confirmation of the trade balance. On the other hand, C&amp;C, the auditors for FY\u00a01997 and FY\u00a01998, did not similarly qualify the financial statements though they did say that they relied entirely on NCL for information regarding the Company. <em>Grand Gain Investment</em> did not apply in this case because of these difficulties faced by the auditors. There was no reason to take NCL\u2019s word for the existence of the debt since NCL had previously tried to dissipate his assets to related companies in an attempt to hide them from WSW during their divorce proceedings (see <em>Ng Bok Eng Holdings</em>), and had used the companies \u201clike an ATM network to withdraw funds as and when required\u201d (GD at [42]). Because the transactions were considered as not being at arms length, the proof of debt should be rejected, as was the case in <em>Re Adam Holdings</em> and <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"/>25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, despite the debt being on the books for a long time, NCL did not attempt to recover the debt at all. The primary supporting documents were destroyed even though NCL knew there could be difficulties in establishing his proof of debt, should the need arise. NCL\u2019s assertion that the supporting documents were sent to the law firm Allen &amp; Gledhill in relation to his divorce proceedings with WSW remained unproved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"/>26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, we are not persuaded that this approach is correct. Instead, we are inclined to agree with the appellant that the liquidator had wrongly exercised her discretion in rigorously insisting on proof of the debt exclusively through primary documents and had in fact acted in excess of her duties in the circumstances. These are our reasons for so doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"/>27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First and foremost, prior to the winding up, the Company consistently acknowledged the debt through audit confirmations and reflected this debt throughout the years in its audited financial statements continuously. It is also pertinent that WSW, <em>qua</em> director and shareholder, had herself confirmed the accuracy of the company\u2019s accounts repeatedly when she approved the same at director\u2019s and shareholders\u2019 meetings. Audit confirmations that the sum of $614,560.71 was due from the company to the appellant were signed by WSW in 1999, 2000 and 2001.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"/>28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OSH argued that although WSW signed off on the Company\u2019s accounts, these accounts were based on the information provided by NCL. However, there is no evidence of any wrongdoing on NCL\u2019s part in the preparation of these accounts. None of the alleged circumstances grounding the liquidator\u2019s decision to reject the proof of debt actually suggested that the debt was fictional. The most that could be said was that the financial statements, ledger entries and audit confirmations relied upon by FCL were not as credible as actual primary supporting documents. But this does not mean that they were of no evidential value. The Company\u2019s audited financial statements were unqualified during the material period from 1988 to 1998. Only after WSW\u2019s matrimonial difficulties with NCL became intractable and WSW and her daughter NE appointed GBK, were the accounts qualified (see <a href=\"#p1_9\">[9]</a> above). The accounts were in fact complete and did not appear to, <em>prima facie</em>, contain errors or omissions. The figures recorded in the Company\u2019s audited financial statements, the audit confirmations, the ledger entries and FCL\u2019s audited financial statements all corroborated each other. Even if NCL was the source from which the auditors gleaned their information, this was consistent with the fact that NCL was the controlling mind of the Company. Who else but NCL would have extensive information about the Company at his finger tips? The fact that the auditors relied on NCL for information does not in itself suggest that the accounts stated were wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"/>29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, this situation is quite unlike that in either <em>Re Adam Holdings Ltd</em> or <em>Re Ice-Mack</em> in that there were no discrepancies between the accounts stated and other documents. In contrast to <em>Re Ice-Mack</em>, there was not just one audit confirmation signed shortly before the debtor was wound up (that in fact conflicted with the debtor\u2019s own audited accounts), but rather a long history of audit confirmations that consistently stated the sum of money owed to FCL. However, although the primary supporting documents were destroyed, they were destroyed because, as explained by the appellant, they were no longer required to be kept under the law. No doubt in certain circumstances the destruction of documents might point to an attempt to conceal evidence, but in this case FCL should not be expected to keep documents longer than necessary under the law to establish its claim especially when, prior to the winding up, there was no challenge to the debt. Only through the unforgiving lens of hindsight could it be said that these documents ought to have been kept because of the liquidator\u2019s demand for further evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"/>30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, the Judge failed to take into consideration the fact that the Company was only an entity to park the trading receipts of FCL, and only whatever was left unclaimed by FCL represented the payment to the Company for its services. As noted in <em>Capital Realty</em>, a transaction will not be at arms length when the circumstances were such as to warrant suspicion of improprieties having been perpetrated, and not merely because the parties were related. Here, the Company was quite plainly a conduit for the receipts from goods sold by FCL to customers in South Africa and Taiwan; the Company\u2019s task essentially was to collect payment from these customers to <em>pay for goods received by these customers from FCL</em>. FCL\u2019s assertion that it was the Company\u2019s main trade creditor was thus not at all surprising, given that FCL (and its related entities) was, by virtue of the Company\u2019s business model, the Company\u2019s primary supplier of goods. There was no suggestion that the trade dealings between the Company and FCL were concocted from the outset. There was also no question of any of the dealings of the company with FCL being at arm\u2019s length. The reality was that the claim was based on entries which the Company and WSW as a director and shareholder had accepted and content to accept as genuine between the Company and FCL. These entries were not fictitious as they were represented by actual cash or receivables in the company\u2019s accounts. FCL\u2019s debt was a genuine debt <em>vis-\u00e0-vis</em> the company. In contrast, the alleged debt in <em>Re Ice-Mack</em> did not arise from the company\u2019s ordinary course of business. Essentially, the circumstances surrounding the incidence of the debt in that case were shrouded in mystery. Coupled with the discrepancies in the accounts stated, there were many reasons for the court in <em>Re Ice-Mack</em> to doubt the existence of the alleged loans. That is not the case here. Even if NCL was the controlling mind behind both FCL and the Company, it was never disputed in this appeal that the two related companies had an established creditor-debtor relationship well before the marriage between WSW and NCL broke down. Before OSH initiated her train of inquiry she ought to have simply asked herself this obvious question: <em>How else could the Company\u2019s assets been accumulated other than through the dealings it had with FCL at the behest of NCL?</em> The Company had no other source of revenue other than through its dealings with FCL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"/>31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although a liquidator has a duty to scrutinise all proofs of debt, there are certain debts which speak for themselves. These are debts which are included as part of the audited accounts of the company and approved by the directors and shareholders at annual shareholders' meetings. Such acknowledged debts <em>prima facie</em> bind the shareholders although they may not bind creditors of the company. In such cases, the liquidator has no duty to expend or waste company's funds to scrutinise such debts unless he has reason to suspect that they were entered in the books to defraud creditors. This is not the case here. There is really nothing to suggest that the debt was fictional. On the contrary, the documents provided consistently recorded the existence of the Company\u2019s debt to FCL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"/>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reiterate that although OSH had the legal right to inquire beyond the accounts in examining proofs of debt, this was not a case which called for such an inquiry. The Company itself had acknowledged that it was solvent and that it owed the debts claimed by FCL. The liquidation was voluntary. It is irrelevant for the purposes of these proceedings that NCL may have taken steps in other unrelated matters to conceal his assets (see <a href=\"#p1_6\">[6]</a> above). Indeed, the relationship between the company and FCL began long before the marriage between WSW and NCL floundered. It is also not insignificant that the ultimate balance due to FCL, in the running account reflected in the Company\u2019s books, had been very substantially reduced when the business relationship stopped (see <a href=\"#p1_8\">[8]</a> above). The accounts were historically complete and there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of NCL in finalising the accounts at the material times. WSW herself had consistently acknowledged the existence of the debt to the appellant by, <em>inter alia</em>, signing the audit confirmations. She cannot approbate and reprobate and now employ the liquidation proceedings as another legal forum to continue wrangling with NCL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"/>33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It appears that OSH decided to do what she did <em>not</em> because she was an exceptionally conscientious liquidator. On the contrary, the facts suggest that she was in a position of conflict of interest, because what she set out to do was not reasonable and could only benefit her appointer, WSW, and no one else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"/>34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the day, it is plain to us that there was no valid reason to reject FCL\u2019s proof of debt. In the result, we allow the appeal and direct OSH to accept FCL\u2019s proof of debt, inclusive of interest at the rate of 3% per annum which is to be calculated on the basis it commences 3 months after the date the proof of debt was lodged with the Company. The appellant will be entitled to costs here and below, with the usual consequential orders. In light of our findings above, it is our view that all of OSH\u2019s costs and disbursements in relation and incidental to FCL\u2019s proof of debt were not properly incurred.

He attacked her with a newly purchased chopping knife and caused numerous wounds. The pathologist, Dr\u00a0Gilbert Lau, determined that six major wounds were inflicted and one of the incised wounds across Chitra\u2019s neck resulted in her death. The appellant was variously a bus driver, a taxi driver, and a lorry attendant. Chitra worked as a factory hand. The couple married on 1\u00a0June 1985 and subsequently produced two children, a daughter born in 1986 and a son in 1989. Between those years, Chitra had an affair with one Murugan. The appellant discovered the affair and only the intervention of his mother stopped him from seeking a divorce then. The appellant forgave Chitra and their marriage continued uneventfully until 2000 when Chitra had an affair with a colleague named Jayaseelan. When the appellant found out about this affair on 28\u00a0March 2000, he beat her with a bamboo pole and fractured her hand. She admitted to being pregnant with Jayaseelan\u2019s baby and the appellant took her to a clinic to have the foetus aborted. Eventually, Jayaseelan returned to India in October 2001, but still sent Chitra a Valentine\u2019s Day card in 2002, which the appellant found and kept. He threatened to divorce Chitra but she pleaded with him not to.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the end of 2001 it was Chitra who had decided to divorce the appellant and the divorce papers as well as an application for a personal protection order (\u201cPPO\u201d) were served on him on 28\u00a0November 2001, whereupon the appellant threatened to kill her if the application for the PPO was not withdrawn. In December 2001, Chitra had an affair with a man called Anan. She denied the appellant\u2019s accusations of her infidelity with Anan, whereupon he beat her again with a bamboo pole. Shortly thereafter, on 10\u00a0January 2002, Chitra lodged a police report about the appellant\u2019s assault on her. On 25\u00a0March 2002, the appellant was convicted of causing grievous hurt and sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment. Chitra visited him in jail and when he was released on 25\u00a0May 2002, she asked for his forgiveness and he forgave her. The trial judge seemed to have accepted that from that time until February 2004 the appellant \u201chad a normal relationship with Chitra\u201d. By \u201cnormal\u201d, we gather that the court meant uneventful. However, it appeared that Chitra had a relationship with a man called Michael Lee. The appellant seemed to be ignorant of this relationship.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In February 2004, Chitra befriended a man called Asokan s/o Muthu Suppiah (\u201cAshok\u201d). He was a security guard in a nearby factory who took the same bus to work as Chitra. It was during the trips to work in February 2004 that Chitra got to know Ashok better. They befriended each other and exchanged stories of their personal lives. Ashok also invited Chitra to the Indian Association to listen to music. The trial judge noted that the appellant stayed away from home from February to 6\u00a0March 2004 after quarrelling with Chitra and his children, and so was unaware of the friendship between Ashok and Chitra at that time. However, the appellant remained in touch with Chitra. On 26\u00a0March 2004 he called to tell her that he would take her home after her night shift. At breakfast, she told him that she had a company barbecue that evening but she would be going there only after 9.00pm to avoid some people she did not like. She left home about 8.30pm, dressed in a sleeveless blouse and a long denim skirt. The appellant thought that that was inappropriate dressing for a barbeque, and as the evening wore on, he began to suspect more and more that Chitra was having an affair. He checked on her with the help of a friend and found no such chalet and no such barbecue as he had been led to believe. He called her on her mobile telephone and demanded that she return home. After that, the appellant telephoned Chitra every five or ten minutes out of suspicion but by that time Chitra had switched off her mobile telephone. When she finally returned home, the appellant thought that she looked dishevelled and inferred that she must have had sexual intercourse earlier on. The trial judge noted in great detail the appellant\u2019s growing suspicion and increasing jealousy from that point up to 17\u00a0May 2004 when he killed her, including the appellant\u2019s remand pending psychiatric assessment after he was charged in the District Court on 10\u00a0April 2004 for stabbing Chitra with a knife. He was released on bail on 7\u00a0May 2004 and went to stay with his mother, but his jealous preoccupation with Chitra was unabated, and on 17 May 2004, he killed her after approaching her on the pretext of asking her to sign papers for their divorce. The trial judge rejected his defence of diminished responsibility by reason of an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility \u2013 the defence under Exception\u00a07 to s\u00a0300 of the Penal Code (Cap\u00a0224, 1985\u00a0Rev Ed), and duly convicted the appellant of murder and sentenced him to death (see <i>PP v G\u00a0Krishnasamy Naidu</i> <nobr>[2006] 3 SLR 44</nobr>). The appellant appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred in rejecting his defence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The analysis of Exception\u00a07 by the Court of Appeal in previous cases had a \u201cthree-stage test\u201d as part of its analysis. In <i>Tengku Jonaris Badlishah v PP</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 260</nobr> (\u201c<i>Tengku Jonaris Badlishah</i>\u201d) at [35], reference was made to <i>Mansoor s/o Abdullah v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 719</nobr> (\u201c<i>Mansoor</i>\u201d) and the court implicitly approved the view of the court in <i>Mansoor</i> that there were \u201cthree limbs\u201d to the defence under Exception\u00a07 as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In <i>Mansoor s/o Abdullah &amp; Anor v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 719</nobr>, it was stated that there are three limbs to this defence. The accused must show on the balance of probabilities that</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time he caused the victim\u2019s death;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 his abnormality of mind arose from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes, or was induced by disease or injury; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 his abnormality of mind substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We are of the view that the three-stage test remains a convenient way of drawing attention to the three critical aspects of the provision in many cases. Unfortunately, the three-stage test is a reference that sometimes admits of a misapplication of the law. We believe that that was what happened in this case. Exception\u00a07 is not meant to be a three-stage provision. On the contrary, it is a composite clause that must be read and applied as a whole. This is what it says:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where Exception\u00a07 is considered strictly in a three-stage fashion, the conclusion at one stage may be irreconcilable with another stage. This appears to be the result in this case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court below proceeded to determine whether Exception\u00a07 applied in this case in a three-stage manner as it was stated in <i>Mansoor</i> above, namely, by first enquiring whether the appellant suffered from an abnormality of mind. After a detailed analysis of the evidence, it decided that the appellant was suffering from such an abnormality. The court then considered the second \u201cstage\u201d, namely whether such abnormality arose from a condition of the mind or some illness, and decided that the medical evidence sufficiently showed that the appellant was suffering from a mental illness that gave rise to the abnormality of mind. Finally, it considered what it understood to be the \u201cthird stage\u201d, namely, whether the mental responsibility of the appellant was sufficiently diminished by the abnormality of mind. Having analysed and answered the first two \u201cstages\u201d in the manner that it did, it would not have been surprising had the court similarly decided in the affirmative in respect of the third limb. However, the court was of the opinion that the mental responsibility of the appellant was not diminished. This was the crux of the appeal before us. Mr\u00a0Fernando, counsel for the appellant, submitted that on the findings of fact made by the trial judge, the court should not have inferred that the mental responsibility of the appellant was not substantially impaired. In support of that argument, counsel also submitted that the court gave far too little weight to the medical evidence of Dr\u00a0Stephen Phang, the medical expert witness for the Defence who was of the opinion that the appellant was labouring under an abnormality of mind occasioned by \u201cmorbid jealousy\u201d, a psychiatric illness, that substantially impaired his mental responsibility.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The gravamen of Exception\u00a07 concerns the straightforward question whether \u201cthe offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind \u2026 as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death\u201d, and, in our view, is really one composite requirement. The cause of that abnormality may be any one of those things cited in parenthesis, namely \u201cwhether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury\u201d. Splitting the one question into three stages or limbs compels the court to ask three questions instead of one. That may be an acceptable method provided that in a case such as the one before us, the court eventually reconstitutes the three stages to the composite question and answers it as a whole. Exception\u00a07 does not require the court to ask, first, whether there was an abnormality of mind, and proceed to ask whether that abnormality had substantially impaired the mental responsibility of the accused if the first answer were in the affirmative. If the mental responsibility of the accused was not impaired, then the answer to the composite question really should be that the accused was not suffering from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility. In <i>Mansoor</i>, the trial judge essentially answered the composite question when he expressed his opinion that the accused did not suffer from any abnormality of mind<i>,</i> a finding that this court accepted (see [27] of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment). Exception\u00a07 is not concerned with all manner of abnormalities but only with those that had substantially impaired the mental responsibility of the accused person. Hence in <i>Tengku Jonaris Badlishah</i> this court was of the view that the psychiatric disorder, dysthymia, did not substantially impair the accused person\u2019s mental responsibility. In our view, it was clear that the question was ultimately answered in a composite way in that case. Similarly, in <i>Chua Hwa Soon Jimmy v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 2 SLR 22</nobr>, this court held, at [33], as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On the totality of the evidence, we concluded that the appellant could have restrained himself, even if we accepted that he was commanded by a voice. His abnormality of mind (if any) was not such as to substantially impair his mental responsibility for the offence committed. After all, he had the presence of mind to try and tie the deceased up when assaulted; to avoid electrocution by using the telephone cord instead of pulling the plug; to look for the keys to make his escape; to put on his boots before leaving the crime scene; and to dispose of his bloodied clothes. His behaviour immediately after the murder was also inconsistent with a person who claimed to be out of control. Therefore, the entire episode, in our judgment, demonstrated that the appellant\u2019s mind was not <i>substantially</i> impaired as to absolve him of mental responsibility for his foul crime. [emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In that case, unlike the present, this court decided the application of Exception\u00a07 by answering it as a composite question.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Admittedly, an inquiry into the application of Exception\u00a07 in any case is essentially an inquiry of fact: see <i>Sek Kim Wah v PP</i> <nobr>[1987] SLR 107</nobr> at 111, [33], as was approved by this court in <i>Mansoor</i> at [13]. Accordingly, in such instances, an appellate court would not normally interfere with the findings of the trial judge, and for good reason: the evidence that the appeal court reads from the record can never appear as sharp and clear as it would to the trial judge who hears it fresh. Indeed, evidence appearing in cold print may sometimes create a contrary impression of the facts as the trial judge first received it. However, when the exercise of fact finding proceeded on a misapplication of the law, the appellate court may intervene if it was satisfied that the misapplication resulted in an erroneous inference of fact. As Wee Chong Jin\u00a0CJ held in <i>Sek Kim Wah</i> (at 111, [33]) \u201cthe verdict as to abnormality of mind is plainly a finding of fact which must be founded on all the evidence which evidence of course includes medical opinion\u201d though we note that the court added that even in cases where the medical opinion was unchallenged, the trial judge was \u201cperfectly entitled to reject or differ from the opinions of the medical men, if there are other facts on which they could do so\u201d (<i>ibid</i>). Reverting to the case before us, the court below held at [198] that \u201cthe Defence has discharged its burden on the first limb. I find that the [appellant] was suffering from the disorder known as morbid jealousy at the time he killed Chitra\u201d. The court then accepted at [200] that \u201cmorbid jealousy is a disease of the mind and that it is a major mental illness\u201d. After making those two findings, the court moved on to the third and last limb, <i>ie</i>, \u201cwhether the disorder had substantially impaired the [appellant\u2019s] responsibility for his act of killing Chitra\u201d (at [201]). Given the court\u2019s findings on what it regarded as the first and second limbs, the question remaining was not whether morbid jealousy could have impaired the mental responsibility of the appellant, but whether it did substantially. To that end, in view of the close connection of the illness to the object of the offence (Chitra), and the finding that the appellant was labouring under an abnormality of mind, one would have thought that the natural inference would be that there had been a substantial impairment of the appellant\u2019s mental responsibility. Instead, the learned judge concluded at [211] as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The burden of proof is on the Defence. I am afraid that the Defence has failed to discharge its burden in respect of the third limb. In the circumstances, I have to reject the defence of diminished responsibility \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By applying the three-stage test and answering each stage in turn as the trial judge did, and finding that morbid jealousy was a disease of the mind and that it resulted in an abnormality of mind in the appellant, the conclusion that the mental responsibility of the appellant was, nonetheless, not substantially impaired requires explanation as to how that conclusion was reached. This is especially so in the light of the fact that this was a case in which the disease of the mind had a close, if not the only, connection between the appellant\u2019s act and Chitra\u2019s death \u2013 a direct correlation between the subject appellant and the object deceased. Indeed, the evidence revealed no other motive or reason, with the court finding as a fact that the subject was suffering from an abnormality of mind caused by a disease directly related to his perception of Chitra\u2019s lack of fidelity to him. The court below appeared to have arrived at the conclusion that there had been no substantial impairment of the appellant\u2019s mental responsibility on two factors. First, the court appeared to be influenced by what it described at [209] as the \u201cdetailed plans to kill and [the appellant\u2019s] execution of the plan, as well as his awareness of the penalty for murder\u201d and also that he wavered in carrying out his plan. The court appeared to have rejected the evidence of Dr\u00a0Phang that a person with an abnormality of mind was still capable of making and carrying out elaborate plans and, instead, drew what appears to us an arbitrary distinction between the ability of an abnormal mind to \u201cplan their travel to a hospital, register to see the doctor and collect and pay for their medication\u201d and the plans that the appellant made to kill Chitra: see [202]. This is where the examination of Exception\u00a07 in three distinct steps instead of a single whole had resulted in a serious incongruity. When a person has already been determined to be suffering from an abnormality of mind in present circumstances, how does one determine what sort of conduct, and at which point that person\u2019s action may be said to have been impaired, and when it has not? If the court has not determined that the person had suffered any abnormality of mind, then it might take such actions and conduct into account in deciding whether or not there was sufficient evidence of abnormality. This difference is vital. It is a difference that would be better appreciated if Exception\u00a07 was applied in the manner we have explained, not as a three-stage inquiry, but a single, composite one, or, if considered in three stages, to review it subsequently as a whole by asking the following question: Did the accused suffer from an abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second consideration as to why the trial judge did not think that there was a substantial impairment of the appellant\u2019s mental responsibility can be found at [210] of the judgment:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On the totality of the evidence, I am not persuaded that the accused could not have resisted his impulse to kill Chitra. That impulse stemmed from his obsession about her. He could not bear to divorce her or to let her be with other men. Such obsessive feelings are also found in persons who are extremely possessive and jealous, but not morbidly so. In my view, his feelings for her, however strong, did not substantially impair his mental responsibility for his actions leading to the killing of Chitra even though he was suffering from a mental disorder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It seems to us that the comparison made with jealous persons who are not suffering from morbid jealousy ought to have yielded the opposite inference \u2013 that there would be no reason to suppose that while normal jealousy would not have resulted in a substantial impairment of mental responsibility, a mind in which the disease of morbid jealousy was raging for a substantial period leading to the killing, was probably so impaired.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those seem to be the reasons explaining why the court thought that in spite of the abnormality of mind caused by the illness of morbid jealousy, the appellant\u2019s mental responsibility was not substantially impaired. In our view, the question of whether the court ought to have then proceeded to state that it found no abnormality of mind that substantially impaired the appellant\u2019s mental responsibility because the illness did not substantially impair the appellant\u2019s mental responsibility is not one of mere semantic nicety. This step (arising from the third limb) is conceptually different from the composite one of finding that the appellant had an abnormality of mind by reason of the illness but that, nonetheless, his mental responsibility was not substantially impaired. The failure to appreciate the conceptual distinction was probably the result of applying the three-stage test. By so doing, the court was bound to explain why it had rejected what would otherwise have been a logical conclusion. As the finder of fact, it was, of course, entitled to apply the three-stage test, but in doing so, it had narrowed the sphere of its inquiry, from the broader one of whether the appellant had an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility, and obligated itself to explain why it did not follow the more natural conclusion that the appellant\u2019s mental responsibility was probably substantially impaired since he had an abnormality of mind caused by the illness of morbid jealousy. The issue before this court was whether the conclusion of the court below in respect of its answer to the third question could be sustained. We are of the unanimous opinion that it could not. The two factors that seemed to have led the court below to its decision did not, in our view, result in the correct inference being made, especially given the well-reasoned medical evidence, as well as the facts accepted by the trial judge. Those showed that the appellant was mentally tormented for long periods by his unshakeable belief that his wife was unfaithful. If the court was of the view that the appellant\u2019s belief was unremarkable or untenable (which was not the case here), then it ought to find that the appellant was either not suffering from an illness, or, that notwithstanding his illness, was not suffering from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility. The conclusion it actually reached, however, though conceptually possible, required convincing reasons in support. That was what we found lacking.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the reasons above, we are of the view that it would not be safe to return a verdict of murder, and we thus set aside the conviction and convict him on a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and punishable under s\u00a0304(<i>a</i>) of the Penal Code.

The Judge\u2019s grounds of decision may be found at <Emphasis type=\"i\">Lee Siew Lin v Oh Choon</Emphasis> [2013] SGHC 25 (\u201cthe GD\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"2\" pID=\"p1_2\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On 4\u00a0September 2013, having considered the written submissions filed by the parties as well as the oral submissions of counsel, we allowed the appeal with regard to the division of matrimonial assets and consequently also varied the maintenance order made by the Judge. We now give the detailed grounds for our decision.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Facts</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The appellant\u2013husband Oh Choon (\u201cthe Appellant\u201d) and the respondent\u2013wife Lee Siew Lin (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d) were married on 2\u00a0August 1993. The marriage did not produce any children.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The matrimonial home at 15A\u00a0Kalidasa Avenue (\u201cthe Matrimonial Home\u201d) was purchased in 1989 in both parties\u2019 names as joint tenants. In June 1999, the Appellant moved out of the Matrimonial Home and on 10\u00a0May 2006, he severed the joint tenancy. However, the Appellant continued to hold a set of keys to the Matrimonial Home. The Matrimonial Home was valued at $640,000 with no outstanding liabilities charged against it.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It was largely undisputed between the parties that they lived in a state of separation after the Appellant moved out of the Matrimonial Home in June 1999. This was so save for the monthly instances until October 2010 when the Appellant would return to the Matrimonial Home. The purpose of these monthly visits was in dispute: the Appellant said that he returned only to give the Respondent a monthly maintenance of $1,200, while the Respondent said that on top of doing so, his monthly visits were also for the purpose of having sexual intercourse with her. In November 2010, when divorce proceedings were commenced by the Appellant, he stopped the monthly visits. Until April 2011, he paid the Respondent\u2019s monthly maintenance via mailed cheques. Interim judgment of divorce was granted on 20\u00a0October 2011 on the factual basis that the parties had been living separately for 4 years.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Between the Appellant moving out of the Matrimonial Home in 1999 and the filing of divorce proceedings, several developments relevant to the present appeal transpired. First, he started a new life with a mistress. Second, in April 2010, he purchased a property, 63\u00a0Thong Soon Green (\u201cthe Property\u201d), in the joint names of himself and his mistress. The Property was valued at $2,480,000 and was subject to an outstanding mortgage loan of $673,650.10. Additionally, he acquired a Mercedes\u00a0E250 (\u201cthe Car\u201d), valued at $179,000, in January 2010. However, it was his contention that when he moved out of the Matrimonial Home in 1999, he was facing financial difficulties and his lot only improved subsequently, such that the Property and the Car were purchased using funds acquired after 1999.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The decision of the court below</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The proceeding below was the Respondent\u2019s application for ancillary relief, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, an order for the division of the matrimonial assets and an order for maintenance pursuant to ss\u00a0112 and 113 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 2009\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), respectively. The Respondent\u2019s case was that the Property and the Car fell into the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided. The Appellant disputed this, and argued that the operative date to determine the pool of matrimonial assets was the date of separation, <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, 1999. Accordingly, because the Property and the Car were purchased <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> the date of separation, they did not fall within the pool to be divided.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge used the date of interim judgment (being 20\u00a0October 2011) as the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets (see the GD at [13]). The Judge reasoned that since the parties were content with leaving the state of affairs as they were and neither took steps to end the marriage by commencing divorce proceedings, there was no clear indication or agreement that the pool would crystallise at the date of separation. In the absence of such an agreement or common understanding between the parties, the date of separation was not an appropriate date to employ. The Judge considered the parties to have continued to accumulate assets on the basis that the marriage was still subsisting even though they were separated. It was therefore not unjust to adopt the date of interim judgment as the point at which to determine the pool of matrimonial assets. Accordingly, the Property and the Car were included as matrimonial assets liable to be divided.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"9\" pID=\"p1_9\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge considered (see the GD at [22]\u2013[24]) that the Appellant had paid for the purchase, renovation, furnishing and maintenance of the Matrimonial Home, while the Respondent had paid for some household and grocery expenses. The Judge then considered that the Respondent had contributed by assisting the Appellant in the kitchen of his commercial catering business (though this must have been only before the parties separated). She also carried out household chores and looked after the Matrimonial Home. The Judge concluded, on a broad brush approach, that the Respondent was entitled to a 26.29% share of the matrimonial assets. To effect this division, the Judge ordered the Appellant to transfer his share of the Matrimonial Home to the Respondent. The parties were to keep all other assets in their respective names.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Finally, the Judge ordered the Appellant to pay to the Respondent lump sum maintenance of $5,000.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The issues before us</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"11\" pID=\"p1_11\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the division of the matrimonial assets, the arguments before us were framed by counsel for the Appellant, Mrs\u00a0Aye Cheng Shone (\u201cMrs\u00a0Shone\u201d), as engaging two issues. The first issue pertained to the operative date for determining the matrimonial assets to be divided. In this regard, Mrs\u00a0Shone argued that assets acquired after the Appellant moved out of the Matrimonial Home ought to be excluded from the pool to be divided. The second issue was the question of the share of the assets the Respondent should be awarded by reference to her indirect contributions.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Division of matrimonial assets</Heading>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Determining the pool of matrimonial assets</Heading>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Using the date of separation as the cut-off date</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As already noted, Mrs\u00a0Shone sought to argue that the marriage was, in substance, a short one of some six years\u2019 duration (until the Appellant moved out of the Matrimonial Home in June 1999) and that, in the circumstances, the Property and the Car (which were acquired <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> the Appellant had moved out of the Matrimonial Home) ought to be excluded altogether from the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided between the parties. This was a <Emphasis type=\"i\">de facto</Emphasis> argument which we could not, with respect, accept \u2013 not least because there continued to be contact (albeit only at monthly intervals) between the Appellant and the Respondent after the former had moved out. Indeed, it was an undisputed fact that the Appellant continued to provide $1,200 in monthly maintenance to the Respondent during these monthly visits to the Matrimonial Home. This itself demonstrated that there was a <Emphasis type=\"i\">continuous (albeit clearly attenuated) relationship</Emphasis> between the parties throughout. By contrast, a marriage might itself be a meaningless one even if husband and wife were living together under the same roof if they treated each other as total strangers. Given the myriad of possible factual situations different marriages may entail, we do not think that the Appellant\u2019s argument should be allowed to find general legal traction. A moment\u2019s reflection will reveal that to take the Appellant\u2019s argument as one of general application would lead to unnecessary complications in the particular cases that the courts might have to deal with in future.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In strict legal terms, the marriage between the parties in the present case had lasted almost three times the duration claimed by the Respondent, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, 18\u00a0years instead of just six. However, we hasten to add that the approach we adopted was not an excessively technical one. This was because the nub of the matter appeared to us to lie, instead, in ascertaining (in particular) the actual contributions (of both a direct and indirect nature) by the Respondent (if any) to the total pool of matrimonial assets. This was an exercise which would in any case take into account the relevant circumstances arising from the fact that the marriage was a short one when viewed from a <Emphasis type=\"i\">de facto</Emphasis> perspective. In particular, if indeed the Appellant could make good his argument that the Respondent had contributed little \u2013 if anything at all \u2013 to the pool of matrimonial assets after he had left the Respondent following the first six years of marriage, that would reduce in a corresponding fashion the proportion of the pool of assets the Respondent would be entitled to upon division. This appeared to us to be a more objective approach which was simultaneously true to legal principle. We would note that this approach of having regard to all such circumstances of the marriage to determine the just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets is consistent with the approach adopted by Assoc Prof\u00a0Debbie Ong (\u201cProf\u00a0Ong\u201d) in Debbie Ong, \u201cFamily Law\u201d (2011) 12\u00a0SAL Ann Rev 298 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Ong</Emphasis>\u201d) at para\u00a015.22. More importantly, this approach would lead precisely to a just and equitable result which was not only what the Appellant was arguing for but is also consistent with the very pith and marrow (and also, language) of s\u00a0112(1) of the Act itself (reproduced below at [15]; and this being in fact the <Emphasis type=\"i\">second issue</Emphasis> raised by the Appellant in the present appeal). As we shall elaborate upon below, acceptance of the Appellant\u2019s original argument would have led to the opposite result inasmuch as it would have entailed this court omitting to properly credit the Respondent for the Appellant\u2019s acquisition of the Property and the Car after he left the Matrimonial Home (see below at [14]). However, the rejection of the Appellant\u2019s original argument did not mean that he was unsuccessful in the context of the present appeal. On the contrary, as we in fact held, the adoption of the abovementioned approach resulted in the Appellant\u2019s <Emphasis type=\"i\">success</Emphasis> in the present appeal.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Given our analysis thus far, it follows that we would respectfully reject the Appellant\u2019s argument (that is, the <Emphasis type=\"i\">first issue</Emphasis>) that the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets in the present case ought to be the date of \u201cseparation\u201d (<Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the date at which the Appellant left the Respondent which was, as already noted, six years after the marriage between the parties in June 1999). Indeed, as the relevant case law makes clear, there is no hard and fast cut-off date for the determination of the pool of matrimonial assets and everything would, in the final analysis, depend on the precise facts of the case itself (see, for example, the decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy</Emphasis> [2011] 2\u00a0SLR 1157 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong Lin</Emphasis>\u201d) at [32]\u2013[36]). In <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong Lin</Emphasis>, this court noted (at [36]) that \u201c[m]ultiple dates are distinctly possible, depending on the nature of the assets and the circumstances surrounding their acquisition\u201d. This court also observed (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">ibid</Emphasis>) that \u201c[u]ltimately, perhaps the adoption of an operative date or dates <Emphasis type=\"i\">may not really be that critical as compared to arriving at a just and equitable division</Emphasis>\u201d [emphasis added]. In the circumstances, we would agree with the Judge that the operative date for the determination of the matrimonial assets in this case should be the date of the interim judgment (<Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, 20\u00a0October 2011). After all, despite the Appellant\u2019s claim that the Property and the Car were purchased with funds acquired after the date of <Emphasis type=\"i\">de facto</Emphasis> separation, this was at the end of the day an assertion which he could not substantiate. Notably, the evidence disclosed that in August 1999, 15\u00a0Kalidasa Avenue, the shophouse below the Matrimonial Home (\u201cthe Shophouse\u201d), which was also jointly owned by the parties (and which undoubtedly was a matrimonial asset which would have been liable to be divided) was sold for $780,000. It was not disputed that the Respondent did not receive any share of the sale proceeds. On the Appellant\u2019s part, he said that after the mortgage on the Shophouse was discharged, not much of the proceeds were left and what was left was used to pay off his business debts. Besides producing an e-mail from a bank saying that it could not reproduce his banking records at the relevant time, nothing was put forward to prove his assertion. At the lowest, the Appellant could have, and in our view should have, produced documentary evidence of these business debts which he said exhausted whatever sale proceeds were available. In the light of the uncertainty as to the destination of the sale proceeds of the Shophouse, a part of which the Respondent was entitled to by reason of her contributions to the marriage, the reasonable inference was that some of these monies were used in some way or form for the acquisition of the Property or the Car. To have excluded the Property and the Car would therefore have been to ignore those contributions of the Respondent to the marriage. The Property and the Car therefore fell within the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided between the parties.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Declining to exercise the power of division over the matrimonial assets</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"15\" pID=\"p1_15\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">However, the Appellant was, in our view, on somewhat firmer legal ground when Mrs\u00a0Shone argued on his behalf that, even if it was assumed that the Property and the Car formed part of the pool of matrimonial assets, they nevertheless ought not to be divided as the court still retained the discretion to exclude specific matrimonial assets by declining to exercise its powers of division over them. This would appear to be the approach preferred by Prof\u00a0Ong (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Ong</Emphasis> at para\u00a015.22), who suggests that the court can decide to award an entire share or a large share of an asset to the party who acquired it after separation.

As Prof\u00a0Leong Wai Kum aptly put it, this was a \u201csolo venture\u201d embarked on by the husband (see Leong Wai Kum, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Elements of Family Law in Singapore</Emphasis> (LexisNexis, 2nd\u00a0Ed, 2013) at p\u00a0561)<Emphasis type=\"i\">.</Emphasis> In the circumstances of that case, the court held that the property in question ought to be <Emphasis type=\"i\">excluded</Emphasis> from the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided. Given the precise facts of the present case, a similar situation could be said to have existed. However, we were of the view that, in the interests of justice and fairness (which, as already mentioned, are consistent with the spirit and purpose of s\u00a0112(1) of the Act (reproduced above at [15])), account ought also to be taken of the (<Emphasis type=\"i\">proportionate</Emphasis>) amount which the Respondent ought to be taken as having contributed towards the purchase of the Property and the Car having especial regard to the fact that the Appellant could reasonably be assumed to have utilised funds which would have been due to the Respondent for her contributions to the marriage in part payment for the Property and the Car (see above at [14])<Emphasis type=\"i\">.</Emphasis> Accordingly, we also declined to adopt this facet of Mrs\u00a0Shone\u2019s submissions (inasmuch as they were premised on the rubric of total exclusion).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We would however observe, parenthetically, that this approach is also consistent with (as well as similar to) that adopted in a situation where a particular matrimonial asset is considered by the court to fall <Emphasis type=\"i\">outside</Emphasis> of the relevant cut-off date and, hence, the pool of matrimonial assets concerned (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong Lin</Emphasis> at [33], analysed above at [14]). This also illustrates the point made by this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong Lin</Emphasis> (at [36]) as well as above (at [13]) that, regardless of the methodology utilised, the crucial objective is to ensure a just and equitable division of the pool of matrimonial assets.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The Respondent\u2019s contributions</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This would be an appropriate juncture to turn to the second issue raised by the Appellant, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the proportion in which the matrimonial assets should be divided between the parties, notwithstanding the fact that the Appellant phrased this particular issue somewhat more narrowly by reference only to the percentage of the pool which should be attributed to the Respondent for her indirect contributions.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It was clear to us that, despite the relatively short period of time the parties were actually together (and the fact that there were no children from the marriage), the Respondent had made both direct as well as indirect financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage which were by no means insubstantial in nature. In this regard, we note that the Judge had found, in particular, as follows (see the GD at [24]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026 I decided on a balance of probabilities that the wife had provided substantial assistance to the husband\u2019s catering business. Even though the couple had no children, I did note that the wife had carried out household chores and had looked after the matrimonial home.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"20\" pID=\"p1_20\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the circumstances, it seemed to us only right that the Respondent should have some share of the total pool of matrimonial assets. Even though the Property and the Car were acquired by the Appellant some time later, it could (as we have noted above at [14]) be reasonably assumed that what would have otherwise been due to the Respondent for her contributions to the marriage (at least for the first six years thereof) would have been utilised by the Appellant in part payment for these assets. On the other hand, as also noted above, we acknowledge the fact that the parties had little to do with each other following the first six years of their marriage. During the period after June 1999, therefore, the Respondent\u2019s contributions to the marriage were \u2013 at best \u2013 negligible (or perhaps even non-existent). Taking all the circumstances into account, we were of the view that the award by the Judge in the court below of 26.29% of the total pool of matrimonial assets of $2,894,874.60 did not, with respect, correctly reflect a just and equitable division of this pool of assets. We were of the view that a just and equitable division would, instead, be 15% of the total pool of matrimonial assets. Hence, we awarded the Respondent a share of the pool of matrimonial assets amounting to $434,231.19 instead. As she already held some of this amount, she would obtain only the difference.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Maintenance</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"21\" pID=\"p1_21\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Given our decision on the issue relating to the division of matrimonial assets, we were of the view that the lump sum maintenance of $5,000 awarded by the Judge to the Respondent ought to be varied. That this was legally permissible is clear from the provisions of the Act itself (see, in particular, s\u00a0114(1)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>)). After all, courts regularly take into account each party\u2019s share of the matrimonial assets when they assess the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered (see, for example, the observation made by this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow</Emphasis> [2012] 2\u00a0SLR 506 at [26]). Indeed this was exactly what the Judge in the court below did when he made his order for lump sum maintenance in the quantum he did. He had observed that the \u201clump sum maintenance [he awarded] would have been significantly higher had the proportion of matrimonial assets given to the wife been any lower than the percentage allocated to her of 26.29% of the total pool of matrimonial assets\u201d (see the GD at [26]). Consequently, as we had in fact <Emphasis type=\"i\">reduced</Emphasis> the proportion of matrimonial assets given to the Respondent, it was only fair that we <Emphasis type=\"i\">varied upwards</Emphasis> the maintenance awarded to her. Furthermore, it was clear that a lump sum maintenance was eminently appropriate in the interests of both parties so that a clean break between them could be effected. Taking into account all the circumstances, we awarded the Respondent lump sum maintenance for five years using a multiplicand of $1,200 per month. The Respondent was therefore awarded lump sum maintenance of $72,000 (being $1,200 <Foreign>\u00d7</Foreign> 12\u00a0months <Foreign>\u00d7</Foreign> 5\u00a0years), instead of the $5,000 awarded by the Judge below.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"22\" pID=\"p1_22\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the reasons set out above, we allowed the appeal with regard to the issue of the division of matrimonial assets and varied the quantum of the lump sum maintenance payable by the Appellant to the Respondent. As the Respondent would not be obtaining complete ownership of the Matrimonial Home, we also ordered that it be sold, with the sale to be conducted within six months by a person appointed by both parties\u2019 solicitors.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We also awarded the costs of the appeal to the Appellant fixed at $5,000 (inclusive of disbursements).

Having heard the oral arguments of the parties, we refused leave. These grounds are issued in response to the arguments advanced by the applicant-wife that the circumstances under which the courts in Singapore should grant leave to appeal should be expanded following the English Court of Appeal decision in <i>Smith v Cosworth Casting Processes Ltd</i> [1997] 4\u00a0All ER 840 (\u201c<i>Smith v Cosworth</i>\u201d).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The background</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The applicant-wife and the respondent-husband were married in 1991.

In April 2001, her husband and the two children went over to New York to join her. Within a matter of a day or two, the wife dropped a bombshell on the husband indicating that she wanted a divorce and asking him to sign a deed of separation prepared by her lawyer. About two months later the husband returned to Singapore with the older daughter, leaving the younger daughter in New York with the mother. Apparently, the husband could not take the younger child back to Singapore because the wife had insisted on keeping the child with her and refused to release the child\u2019s passport to him to enable the child to make the journey home. We ought to add here that the wife claimed that there was an agreement with the husband, following the parties\u2019 separation, that the younger daughter could remain with her. This assertion was disputed by the husband.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Soon after the husband returned to Singapore, the wife (together with the younger daughter) moved in to live with her male companion, who has three children (aged six to nine) from his first wife. On 19\u00a0October 2001, the wife filed a petition for divorce in Singapore. On 6\u00a0August 2002, a decree <i>nisi</i> dissolving the marriage was granted. The parties managed to agree on other ancillary matters except in respect of the custody of the two children. On 1\u00a0December 2004, the district judge, after considering all the circumstances of the case, including three custody evaluation reports, granted custody of the older daughter to the husband and the younger daughter to the wife. The district judge also made provisions for access by both parties to the child not in his or her custody so that the two children would have sufficient time together.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The husband was dissatisfied with the custody order made by the district judge with regard to the younger child and filed an appeal. The appeal came before Andrew Ang\u00a0JC (as he then was) who made the following orders:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There shall be joint custody of the younger child to the husband and the wife but care and control of the younger child shall be with the husband.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That the husband and the wife agree on access, if possible, failing which there would be liberty to apply.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Before arriving at this conclusion, the judge had an extensive interview with the younger child to gauge her feelings on the matter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Appeal framework</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a028A(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d) empowers the Chief Justice, \u201cwhere he considers it necessary or expedient to improve efficiency in the administration of justice and to provide for more speedy disposal of proceedings commenced in the High Court\u201d to, by order, direct that such proceedings be heard and determined by the district court.

Under para\u00a02 of this Order, proceedings under Part\u00a0X of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed), which covers divorce, custody and maintenance matters, commenced in the High Court, are transferred to be heard and determined by a district court. However, under the same paragraph, where the gross value of the matrimonial assets is asserted by any party to the proceedings to be of or above the value of $1.5m, the application for division of matrimonial assets must be transferred to and be heard and determined by the High Court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in para\u00a06 of the same Order, it is provided that an appeal shall lie to the High Court in respect of a decision of the district court in relation to any proceedings heard and determined by the district court pursuant to the Order.

In terms of local jurisprudence, we need not go further back than <i>Anthony s/o Savarimiuthu v Soh Chuan Tin</i> <nobr>[1989] SLR 607</nobr>, where the High Court had to decide whether leave should be granted to enable an appeal to be taken in the case as the amount involved was below the limit set by s\u00a021 of the SCJA. In this regard, Lai Kew Chai\u00a0J examined two previous cases, namely, <i>Wong Yin v Wong Mook</i> <nobr>[1948] 1 MLJ 164</nobr> and <i>Pang Hon Chin v Nahar Singh</i> <nobr>[1986] 2 MLJ 145</nobr>, and came to the conclusion (at 608, [2]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The circumstances for granting leave would include (though obviously not limited to) cases where an applicant is able to demonstrate a <i>prima facie</i> case of error or if the question is one of general principle upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to public advantage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next is the case of <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i> <nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 489</nobr>, where leave was applied for to appeal against a costs order. Under s\u00a034(2)(<i>b</i>) of the SCJA, leave is required where the only issue in the appeal relates to costs. There this court declared at [16] that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[I]t is apparent that there are at least three limbs which can be relied upon when leave to appeal is sought: (1)\u00a0<i>prima facie</i> case of error; (2)\u00a0question of general principle decided for the first time; and (3)\u00a0question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case, in requesting us to grant leave, the wife effectively asked us not to follow what this court had laid down in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i> to be the applicable guidelines in granting leave, but to adopt the more liberal approach enunciated by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>) where the plaintiff\u2019s (Smith\u2019s) action was struck out under the English County Court Rules O\u00a017 r\u00a011. There, the plaintiff sought leave to appeal from a single Lord\u00a0Justice who granted it.

This test is not to be treated differently from \u201cno arguable case\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the court can grant leave even if the court is not satisfied that the appeal has any prospect of success, <i>eg</i>, the issue may be one which the court considers should, in the public interest, be examined, or, more specifically, the court takes the view that the case raises an issue where the law requires clarification.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where leave is granted by a single Lord\u00a0Justice, the opposing party should only apply to set the leave aside if that party can show not only that the appeal has no realistic prospect of success but that there is no other good reason for granting leave.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These guidelines were subsequently re-stated and amplified in the Practice Direction for the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) reported at <nobr>[1999] 1 WLR 1027.</nobr></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would be seen that guideline\u00a0(b) in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i> (see [12] above) is broadly similar to the second and third guidelines enumerated by this court in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i> (see [11] above). However, there is a significant difference between guideline\u00a0(a) in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i> and guideline\u00a0(1) in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i>. While under the <i>Smith v Cosworth</i> guideline\u00a0(a), all that needs to be established for leave to be granted is really just an arguable case, that is not the position under this court\u2019s guideline in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i>, which requires a much higher threshold to be met before leave may be granted, namely, the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case of error. Lord\u00a0Woolf explained why guideline\u00a0(a) was expressed in those terms (at 840):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This test is not meant to be any different from that which is sometimes used, which is that the applicant has no arguable case. Why however this court has decided to adopt the former phrase is because the use of the word \u2018realistic\u2019 makes it clear that a fanciful prospect or an unrealistic argument is not sufficient.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note that while the guidelines in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i> were laid down on 26\u00a0February 1997, they were only published in the fourth quarter of 1997. <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i> was heard and decided on 22\u00a0July 1997, with the written grounds being delivered on 22\u00a0August 1997. It does not appear that <i>Smith v Cosworth</i> was cited to this court in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Singapore Civil Procedure</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2003\u00a0Ed) (\u201cthe White Book\u201d) the authors stated at para\u00a057/16/13:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The general test which the court applies in deciding whether or not to grant leave to appeal is this: leave will normally be granted unless the grounds of appeal have no realistic prospects of success (<i>Smith v Cosworth Casting Processes Ltd (Practice Note)</i> [1997] 1\u00a0W.L.R. 1538; [1997] 4\u00a0All E.R. 840, CA). The Court of Appeal may also grant leave to appeal where the applicant is able to demonstrate a <i>prima facie</i> case of error (see (1907), 123 L.T. Jo. 202; see also <i>Lee Kuan Yew v. Tang Liang Hong</i> [1997] 3 S.L.R. 489, CA where Yong Pung How\u00a0C.J. granted an application for leave to appeal against an order for costs on the basis that the High Court exercised its discretion wrongly and therefore there had been a <i>prima facie</i> case of error (at paras\u00a031-38)), if the question is one of general principle, decided for the first time (<i>Ex p. Gilchrist, Re Armstrong</i> (1886) 17\u00a0Q.B.D. 521, <i>per</i> Lord Esher\u00a0M.R. at 528) or a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of the Court of Appeal would be to the public advantage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The wife relied, in particular, on the first sentence of the above passage of the White Book to suggest that that was also the applicable law in Singapore governing the granting of leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The authors do not appear to have considered whether the two tests of \u201cno realistic prospect of success\u201d and \u201c<i>prima facie</i> case of error\u201d are consistent or reconcilable. For the reasons given above, it is clear to us that these two tests are quite different. As Lord\u00a0Woolf\u00a0MR had clarified in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i>, the \u201cno realistic prospect of success\u201d test was intended to be no different from that of \u201cno arguable case\u201d. Thus it would be wrong, or at least confusing, to cite the two tests side by side as if to suggest that both tests are applicable. If the applicable test is that of \u201cno realistic prospect of success\u201d, the test of \u201c<i>prima facie</i> case of error\u201d will be quite redundant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the wife had not really submitted any reason why this court should not follow the test of <i>prima facie</i> case of error and should, instead, adopt the test of no realistic prospect of success. Although in the later High Court case of <i>Pandian Marimuthu v Guan Leong Construction Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] 3 SLR 400</nobr>, G\u00a0P\u00a0Selvam\u00a0J had referred to the test enunciated in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i>, the judge had stated the test in a somewhat different form, namely (at [11]), \u201cwhether the appeal is likely to succeed and whether, if leave is not granted, there is a likelihood of substantial injustice\u201d. It seems to us that this is more akin to the test of <i>prima facie</i> case of error rather than to the arguable case test.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further, other later High Court cases had consistently applied the guidelines laid down in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i>, <i>eg</i>, <i>Abdul Rahman bin Shariff v Abdul Salim bin Syed</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 716</nobr>; <i>Lam Seng Hang Co Pte Ltd v The Insurance Corporation of Singapore Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 179</nobr>; <i>Goh Kim Heong v AT\u00a0&amp;\u00a0J Co Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] 4 SLR 262</nobr> and <i>Essar Steel Ltd v Bayerische Landesbank</i> <nobr>[2004] 3 SLR 25.</nobr></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Abdul Rahman bin Shariff v Abdul Salim bin Syed</i>, Tay Yong Kwang\u00a0JC (as he then was) clarified at [30] that the test of <i>prima facie</i> case of error would not be satisfied by the assertion that the judge had reached the wrong conclusion on the evidence. Leave should not be granted when there were mere questions of fact to be considered. He said that it must be a <i>prima facie</i> case of error of law that had a bearing on the decision of the trial court. In our opinion, this is a useful amplification of the first guideline set in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If we were to adopt the test of \u201crealistic prospect of success\u201d propounded in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i>, it would be a rather low threshold to meet. As we have indicated before, that test is really an \u201carguable case\u201d test which would not be a difficult one to satisfy. This would effectively mean that many cases would have to be permitted to go further to the Court of Appeal, thus clogging up the Court of Appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An examination of s\u00a034 of the SCJA would show that, as a general rule, it is intended that there should only be one tier of appeal as a matter of right. A litigant in a case commenced in the Subordinate Courts would have a right of appeal to the High Court. Any further appeal to the Court of Appeal would require the leave of court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When matrimonial matters were first transferred to be heard in the district court in 1996, an anomaly appeared. This was because it was not possible to quantify, in monetary terms, a divorce or custody matter. Thus, before the enactment of s\u00a028A of the SCJA, a decision of the district court in a divorce proceeding could be taken up all the way to the Court of Appeal, as it would not be caught by the restriction imposed in s\u00a034(2)(<i>a</i>) which prescribes that no appeal may be brought to the Court of Appeal except with leave where the subject matter at the trial is of a value of $250,000 or less. The object of enacting s\u00a028A was to correct this anomaly. The Deputy Prime Minister (\u201cDPM\u201d) and Minister for Law, Prof\u00a0S\u00a0Jayakumar, in moving the second reading of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill (No\u00a035 of 2004) on 21\u00a0September 2004, which sought to amend the SCJA, including the addition of the new s\u00a028A, said (<i>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</i> (21\u00a0September 2004) vol 78\u00a0 at cols 682 to 683):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">These amendments were proposed by the Supreme Court to address an anomaly. With respect to civil proceedings (other than family law matters), which are heard in the Subordinate Courts, a party has, subject to certain statutory conditions, the right to appeal to the High Court. Leave is needed for a further appeal to the Court of Appeal. However, in family law cases, parties currently have the right to appeal from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court and then make a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, without having to seek leave. This is an anomaly which needs correction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the interests of finality, there should be only one tier of appeal as a matter of right for family cases, with a second appeal only with the leave of court. The general position in Singapore for civil cases, other than family cases, is only one tier of appeal as a matter of right. This is because having an automatic second tier of appeal delays a final decision on the matter and increases costs for litigants.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to what was clearly legislative intent, we did not think this court should adopt the more liberal regime for granting leave to appeal expounded in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i>. In England it would appear that the object of the leave mechanism was to filter out appeals \u201cwhich had no hope of success\u201d: see <i>Alliance &amp; Leicester Plc v Paul Robinson &amp; Co</i> [2000] CP Rep 3 <i>per</i> Auld\u00a0LJ. To grant leave liberally would have subverted what our Parliament had intended, <i>ie</i>, that, as a rule, there should only be one tier of appeal. Indeed, the DPM had also in the same statement referred to the three guidelines laid down in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i> for the granting of leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In this regard, it should be noted that the DPM had emphasised in the same speech in Parliament that the Court of Appeal\u2019s resources would be better utilised in dealing with questions of law. Accordingly, we could not adopt the English yardstick for use in Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Question of law of importance</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the wife had in the main relied upon guideline\u00a0(a) in <i>Smith v Cosworth</i> to apply for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, she had also submitted that the proposed appeal raised a question of general principle and of importance on which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage, a line of argument falling within guidelines\u00a0(2) and (3) of <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i>. The wife further submitted that the case involved an interplay of three important legal principles which the court would take into consideration in determining custody, namely, maintaining status quo; preservation of mother-child bond; and that siblings should be brought up together. She said that the applicability and weight to be given to each of the three principles was a matter of general importance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is clear to us that the paramount consideration in every case where custody is in issue is the welfare of the child. That is the immutable principle. The term \u201cwelfare\u201d should be taken in its widest sense and we do not think it is possible or desirable to define it. In <i>Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey</i> <nobr>[1987] SLR 549</nobr>, Chan Sek Keong\u00a0JC (as he then was), in reference to the term \u201cwelfare\u201d, said (at 551, [12]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It means the general well-being of the child and all aspects of his upbringing, religious, moral as well as physical. His happiness, comfort and security also go to make up his well-being. A loving parent with a stable home is conducive to the attainment of such well-being. It is not to be measured in monetary terms.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What would be in the interests of the child must necessarily depend on all the circumstances of the case. The court, where appropriate, will have regard to the factors the wife had mentioned, <i>ie</i>, maintaining status quo, preservation of mother-child bond and that siblings should not be separated. Other factors will include the home environment and care arrangements made for the child, the conduct of the parties and the wishes of the child. We must reiterate that this enumeration is not meant to be exhaustive. The court will have to carry out a balancing exercise to determine, as between the two parents, to whom custody should be given in the best interests of the child. A factor which may be determinant in one case may not necessarily be so in another. So the weight to be given to each factor may vary from case to case. No precise formulation is possible. This is not a scientific exercise but one of judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, we were also not satisfied that the wife had shown that she had met guidelines\u00a0(2) or (3) set out in <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</i> for leave to appeal to be granted.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\F\\9\\f99cf38fb5f2e80d3a15925958297547\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"53424\" id=\"53424-M\" uniqueid=\"ac9ed50a-5f26-4bc3-9875-b151936e26f1\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/53424-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2007-07-13T09:47:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2007-06-26T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2007</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2007</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>33</No>\n      <NCit>[2007] SGCA 33</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2007</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>33</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2007] SGCA 33</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</SortTitle><SortDate>2007-06-26T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA 116/2006</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Plaintiff</Role>\n        <Name>Lock Yeng Fun</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#2\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Defendant</Role>\n        <Name>Chua Hock Chye</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#7\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third Party</Role>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#55\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Chan Sek Keong CJ</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#392\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#572\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V K Rajah JA</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Lim See Wai Victor (Hoh Law Corporation) for the appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>The respondent in person</Counsel>\n    </Counsels>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2105\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Family Law</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2208\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Matrimonial assets</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"3\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2210\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Division</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Principles governing division of matrimonial assets</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Significance of (direct) financial contributions</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"6\">Whether equal division warranted on facts</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n  \n\n<SLR>YES</SLR></Metadata>\n</CaseReport>\n<body>\n    <p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"/>\n\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"349\"><a id=\"OLE_LINK2\" name=\"OLE_LINK2\"/><a id=\"OLE_LINK1\" name=\"OLE_LINK1\"/> \n\n<p class=\"judg-date-reserved\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">26 June 2007</span></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"20%\">\n<p class=\"judg-date-reserved\">\u00a0</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Author\">Andrew Phang Boon Leong\u00a0JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is an appeal by the petitioner wife against the ancillary orders made by the trial judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) in <i>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</i> <nobr>[2006] SGHC 230</nobr> (\u201cGD\u201d) with respect to both the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance.

The acrimony and bitterness between the parties were clearly evident from the (hurtful) allegations and accusations they hurled against each other. However, whilst this was unfortunate, we found that all this was irrelevant to the decision of this court in the present appeal, not least because these allegations and accusations cast no real light on the legal issues before us. At this juncture, it is apposite to make a brief note of the matrimonial assets available for division between the parties, after which we will proceed to set out the significant factors that were integral to and formed the basis of our decision to award, between them, an equal division of the assets acquired throughout the 30-year marriage. We will then consider each of the main issues, <i>viz</i></span>, the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance, in relation to the relevant facts and legal principles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><strong>Matrimonial assets available for division</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The matrimonial assets to be divided comprise the following:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home at 16\u00a0Namly Garden;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the wife\u2019s assets including, but not limited to, investments and the surrender value of insurance policies; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the husband\u2019s assets.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would suffice to note that the value of assets (a) and (c) are not in dispute.

The respondent was the sole breadwinner throughout the marriage and supported the appellant and their children financially. Although the respondent did not have a tertiary education, he was undoubtedly very successful in his career, rising steadily through the ranks and eventually reaching the position of vice-president in three foreign banks.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, and this is the first unusual circumstance in the present case, we note that the family never employed any domestic help and hence the appellant shouldered, solely, the burden of looking after the household and the growing children. This was particularly so during the relatively long periods between 1984 and 1985 and between 1992 and 1998, when the respondent was based overseas in Malaysia and Indonesia, respectively.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, apart from caring for the respondent (when he was in Singapore), the home, and the children of the marriage, the appellant also managed to amass a sizable sum of close to $500,000 from her investments (albeit from the moneys given to her by the respondent for household and miscellaneous expenses). On the other hand, based on the disclosed investments in the husband\u2019s name, it would appear that he was a poor investor or saver, having only accumulated $230,000 \u201c</span>after almost a lifetime of work<span lang=\"EN-AU\">\u201d: see GD at [20].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thirdly, another pertinent fact to be noted is that the respondent, being 56\u00a0years old and suffering from arthritic limbs and vision problems, has little or almost no prospect of a higher earning capacity. The monthly income from his training and consultancy business of approximately $600 to $800 can hardly be considered a steady source of revenue, bearing in mind the fact that the business itself has no intrinsic value. This was a relevant factor in our decision to rescind the maintenance order made by the Judge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><strong>Ancillary orders made by the trial judge</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the court below, the Judge made the following ancillary orders:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The matrimonial property is to be sold in the open market within 12 months of the Judge\u2019s order. The <i>net proceeds of sale<b>,</b></i> but before Central Provident Fund (\u201cCPF\u201d) deductions, are to be divided in the ratio 60% to the respondent and 40% to the petitioner. The respondent is to refund his own CPF moneys from his share of the proceeds of sale.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the other assets, the division of such assets shall also be in the ratio of 60% to the respondent and 40% to the petitioner. The net difference is to be deducted from the division of the sale of the matrimonial home from the petitioner\u2019s share of proceeds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent is to pay the petitioner maintenance of $60,000 in a lump sum. This amount may be paid from the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to consider the two main issues raised in this appeal, <i>viz</i></span>, the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Division of matrimonial assets</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the appellant, Mr\u00a0Victor Lim, and the respondent (who appeared in person) agreed that the case law supported the decision arrived at by the Judge in giving the husband and the wife in the present proceedings 60 per cent and 40 per cent of the matrimonial assets, respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, Mr\u00a0Lim argued that the appellant wife should be entitled to retain her own assets. In this connection, we should take another look at the precise value of these assets. They were assessed by the Judge to have a value of $577,000. This amount included a sum of $127,000, being the total value of various insurance policies. However, the Judge valued one of these policies at $70,000. As the respondent argued (correctly, in our view), this amount of $70,000 was the insured value of the policy and not its surrender value, which was the relevant value the court ought to have taken into account. The surrender value was, in fact, only $21,457.12, as confirmed by a letter from the insurer itself, which the respondent tendered to the court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\">26<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> On a related point, the appellant also sought to argue that two other insurance policies purchased by the appellant using money from her CPF were double-counted and their total value should be deducted from the sum of $127,000 referred to in the preceding paragraph. We find, however, that apart from mere assertion, the appellant produced no evidence to support this point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances, we find the total value of the insurance policies to be $78,457.12 (taking into account the fact that the value of one of the policies was only $21,457.12 instead of $70,000, as noted above). The total amount of the appellant\u2019s assets would accordingly have a value of $528,457.12 (instead of $577,000).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is also appropriate, in this connection, to describe the <i>other</i> assets that would form part of the pool of matrimonial assets available for division under s 112 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first comprises the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial property (less the expenses connected with the sale). The matrimonial property was sold for $2.45m.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second comprises the respondent husband\u2019s assets. The Judge found these to have a total value of $230,000. This finding was not controverted by the appellant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, therefore, the assets that form part of the pool of matrimonial assets available for division by the court comprise the following:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial property ($2.45m), less the expenses connected with the sale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the wife\u2019s assets valued at $528,457.12; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the husband\u2019s assets valued at $230,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><em>The issue</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main issue before us was a simple one: Should the decision by the Judge in dividing the above assets in the proportion of 60 per cent to the respondent and 40 per cent to the appellant be disturbed?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Our decision</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is axiomatic that the division of matrimonial property under s\u00a0112 of the Act is not \u2013 and, by its very nature, cannot be \u2013 a precise mathematical exercise. As was recently pointed out in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee Guan</i> <nobr>[2006] 4 SLR 605</nobr> at [66]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is now widely acknowledged that the court\u2019s discretion is to be exercised in broad strokes rather than by way of an unrealistic mathematical approach (see <i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Singapore</i> [vol\u00a011 (LexisNexis, 2006 Reissue, 2006)] at paras\u00a0130.757 and 130.759, citing the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Koo Shirley v Mok Kong Chua Kenneth</i> <nobr>[1989] SLR 342</nobr> and the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <i>Yeong Swan Ann v Lim Fei Yen</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 651</nobr>). The focus is also on achieving a fair and reasonable division (see <i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Singapore</i> at paras\u00a0130.760 and 130.761). All this is undoubtedly not only consistent with the existing case law but is also both logical and commonsensical. But there is no substitute for a careful consideration of all the relevant facts and factors in the case at hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even more recently, V\u00a0K\u00a0Rajah\u00a0J (as he then was) observed, in a similar vein, in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>NI v NJ</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 75</nobr>, as follows (at [18]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The division of matrimonial assets is a subject to be approached with a certain latitude; it calls for the application of sound discretion rather than a purely rigid or mathematical formulae. All relevant circumstances should be assessed objectively and holistically. Generally speaking, however, when a marriage ends a wife is entitled to an equitable share of the assets she has helped to acquire directly or indirectly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reference may also be made to the observations of this court in <i>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng</i> <nobr>[2001] 3 SLR 225</nobr> (\u201c<i>Lim Choon Lai</i>\u201d) (discussed at [58] below).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bearing in mind the general guidelines as well as the approach above, we are of the view that an appellate court should not interfere with a trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion except in only very exceptional circumstances.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We were persuaded, in the final analysis, that there were exceptional circumstances in the present appeal and we therefore ordered that the matrimonial assets (at [31] above) be divided between the parties in equal shares instead. Let us elaborate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It will be recalled that Mr\u00a0Lim had argued, on behalf of the appellant wife, that she ought to be allowed to retain her own assets (which totalled $528,457.12 (see above at [31])). In particular, he argued that the appellant had painstakingly accumulated these assets by setting aside the housekeeping money that she had received from the respondent and had invested such money wisely, thus accumulating a considerable amount of assets. Further, this was accomplished even though she had to look after the needs of every member of the family (including the respondent and their two children). As the Judge aptly observed (GD at [22]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The petitioner [the appellant in the present appeal] looked after the home and bore the children; indeed for a few years she did it alone while the respondent [the respondent in the present appeal] was based overseas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this regard, we also endorse the following views expressed by Debbie Ong Siew Ling &amp; Valerie Thean, \u201cFamily Law\u201d, (2005) 6\u00a0SAL Ann Rev\u00a0259 at para\u00a013.31:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It could be contended that in most cases where one party experiences great financial success, the other often bears a heavy burden in respect of the children and home; in some cases this entails the sacrifice of any potential for career development. Non-financial contributions are impossible to measure, and success on that front, intangible and difficult to define. It is hoped that this would not stand in the way of courts according due regard to the fact that the financial aspect is but one facet of the many demands that husband and wife must have weathered if a family has had many years together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Our examination of the case law shows that the courts might not have given sufficient recognition to the value of factors like homemaking, parenting and husbandry when attributing to them a financial value in the division of matrimonial assets. This ought <i>not</i> to be the case. It is true that, by their very nature, such kinds of contributions to the marriage are, as pointed out in the quotation above, difficult to measure because they are, intrinsically, incapable of being measured in precise financial terms (we assume that this is what the authors meant when they said that such contributions were impossible to measure). Difficulty in measuring the financial value of such contributions has never been \u2013 and ought never to be \u2013 an obstacle to giving the spouse concerned his or her just and equitable share of the matrimonial assets that is commensurate with his or her contributions, taking into account (of course) the other relevant contributions and factors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although Mr\u00a0Lim\u2019s arguments (as set out briefly at [38] above) were intuitively attractive, we were unable to accept them based on legal principle. A broad-brush approach is not a licence for the court to ignore the spirit and intent of the legislative framework. In particular, if accepted, such an argument would undermine the very basis upon which s\u00a0112 of the Act was premised: that matrimonial assets are not to be viewed as belonging to the husband or the wife exclusively, to be dealt with accordingly upon a divorce. On the contrary, the legislative mandate to the courts is to treat all matrimonial assets as community property (or, as one writer put it, \u201cdeferred community of property\u201d inasmuch as the concept of community property does not take place until the marriage is terminated legally) to be divided in accordance with s\u00a0112 of the Act (and see generally Leong Wai Kum, <i>Halsbury\u2019s</i> <i>Laws of Singapore: Family Law</i>, vol\u00a011 (LexisNexis, 2006 Reissue, 2006) (\u201c<i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Singapore</i>\u201d) at para\u00a0130.751).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, in addition to the non-financial contributions of a spouse (more often than not, the wife), attention must be given to his or her direct financial contributions through his or her efforts in increasing the total value of the matrimonial assets. This contribution must be taken into account for the purpose of increasing the proportion of matrimonial assets to be awarded to that spouse. This is not only logical but is also eminently fair. This is, in fact, the situation in the present case where the wife not only looked after the home and the children for 30 years, but also, by her own efforts and investment skills, increased the value of the family assets considerably to an amount much larger than that brought in by the husband. In the circumstances, she must be given due credit for this direct financial contribution in the division of matrimonial assets. It is principally for this reason that we decided that a fair and equitable distribution of the matrimonial assets would be on the basis of an equal distribution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We turn now to the issue of maintenance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It will be recalled that the Judge ordered a lump sum payment of $60,000 in lieu of monthly maintenance, which amount represented, in his view, on a multiplier of 16 years, a multiplicand of about $300 per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent argued before us that the multiplier of 16 years was wrong and ought to have been 13 years taking into account the current life expectancy of Singaporeans. We accepted this argument but having regard to our disposition of this issue, it was an irrelevant argument. We turn, instead, to the nub of the matter, which is as follows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note that, given his present age, various physical disabilities and his present employment situation, the present, as well as future, income expectations of the respondent could only be modest. This fact probably accounted for the Judge\u2019s order that the respondent pay a lump sum maintenance of $60,000 to the wife.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also note that, in the court below, the appellant had asked for a lump sum of $144,000, whereas the respondent proposed the payment of a lump sum of $18,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An order of maintenance is, as s\u00a0113 of the Act clearly states, within the discretion of the court, taking into account the various matters mentioned in s\u00a0114(1) of the Act (which matters are, we note, not exhaustive). Section\u00a0114(1) of the Act itself reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>Assessment of maintenance</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>114.</b>\u2014(1)\u00a0In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<i>a</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<i>b</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<i>c</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<i>d</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<i>e</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<i>f</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the contributions made by each of the parties to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<i>g</i>)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, and in particular our decision to order an equal distribution of the matrimonial assets, the proper order to make is that there should be no order as to maintenance at all. This would give effect to the general purpose and tenor of s\u00a0114(2) of the Act, which reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Remaining matters</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">49<b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> The respondent sought to argue that the appellant had actively concealed her assets and that she had also utilised funds from a bank account to purchase a new property after the decree <i>nisi</i> had been granted but prior to the grant of the decree absolute. He argued that the property should have been brought into the pool of matrimonial assets for division. However, we rejected his arguments as they constituted mere assertions without any evidentiary foundation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>A coda: No starting point of equality</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">50<b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b> The decision in the present appeal is one of the occasions when this court has decided that an equal division of matrimonial assets is just and equitable on the facts of the case (the others being <i>Lim Choon Lai</i> ([35] <i>supra</i>), <i>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</i> <nobr>[2000] 4 SLR 466</nobr> (\u201c<i>Yow Mee Lan</i>\u201d) and <i>Ryan v Berger</i> <nobr>[2001] 1 SLR 419</nobr>). This was the <i>end point</i> of our deliberations in this case, and not the starting point. However, it appears that the contrary proposition (to the effect that an equal division of matrimonial assets should be the starting point or presumption or norm) is still being advocated in academic circles: see, for example, <i>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Singapore</i> ([40] <i>supra</i> at paras\u00a0130.817\u2013130.821) and, by the same author, \u201cThe Just and Equitable Division of Gains between Equal Former Partners in Marriage\u201d [2000] Sing\u00a0JLS 208 as well as \u201cThe Laws in Singapore and England Affecting Spouses\u2019 Property on Divorce\u201d [2001] Sing\u00a0JLS 19 (<i>contra</i>, Debbie Ong Siew Ling &amp; Valerie Thean, \u201cFamily Law\u201d (2001) 2\u00a0SAL\u00a0Ann\u00a0Rev 226 at para\u00a013.31). Such a proposition cannot, with respect, be accepted, as the legislative framework set out in s\u00a0112 of the Act neither expresses nor implies the idea of equality of division as a starting point or presumption or norm from which either spouse can either chip away or bolster the division in his or her favour. In the past, some judges have leaned towards the idea of equality as a starting point (see, for example, <i>Soh Chan Soon v Tan Choon Yock</i> <nobr>[1998] SGHC 204</nobr> and <i>Louis Pius Gilbert v Louis Anne Lise</i> <nobr>[2000] 1 SLR 274</nobr>), but these decisions are outnumbered by those which have decided otherwise (see, for example, <i>Lau Loon Seng v Sia Peck Eng</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 408</nobr> (\u201c<i>Lau Loon Seng</i>\u201d), <i>Yow Mee Lan</i> (<i>supra</i>), <i>Ryan v Berger</i> (<i>supra</i>) and, most importantly, this court\u2019s decision in <i>Lim Choon Lai</i> ([35] <i>supra</i>))<i>.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In England, where the idea of equality in the division of matrimonial assets is probably more prevalent among the judges, the House of Lords held in <i>White v White</i> [2001] 1\u00a0AC 596 (\u201c<i>White</i>\u201d) (at 605\u2013606) that the concept of equal division should be used as a <i>check</i> (rather than as a substantive starting point, though Lord Cooke of Thorndon (at 615) doubted whether the labels \u201cyardstick\u201d or \u201ccheck\u201d would produce any result different from \u201cguidelines\u201d or \u201cstarting point\u201d) against the tentative views reached, and, only then, to ensure the absence of discrimination between husband and wife and their respective roles. Indeed, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, who delivered the main judgment of the House in that case, stated (in no uncertain terms) that the suggested approach \u201cis <i>not</i> to introduce a presumption of equal division under another guise\u201d [emphasis added] (at 605; see also at 606). The learned law lord, in fact, observed that such a presumption could only be introduced by <i>Parliament</i> (see <i>White</i> at 606). Indeed, Lord Nicholls emphasised the fact that <i>fairness</i> was the main focus in so far as the division of matrimonial assets was concerned (see, for example, <i>White</i> at 599\u2013600, 604 and 605 as well as (generally) observations to the same effect by the same law lord in <i>Miller v Miller</i> [2006] 2\u00a0AC 618 at [1]\u2013[20]). Significantly, the House in <i>White</i> did <i>not</i> decide on an equal division of matrimonial assets based on the facts and circumstances of that particular case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under our law, it is doubtful whether it is even proper for the courts to use the concept of equality of division of matrimonial assets in the way that the law lords in <i>White</i> have proposed. The reason is that our Parliament appears to have decreed otherwise. The pre-legislative materials make it clear what Parliament had intended when it enacted s\u00a0112 of the Act. Prior to its enactment in 1996 as an amendment to the existing law, the amendment Bill was taken through a Select Committee at which representations were made in favour of a presumption of equality of division of matrimonial assets. These views were <i>rejected</i> by the Select Committee in its <i>Report of the Select Committee on the Women\u2019s Charter (Amendment) Bill [Bill No 5/96]</i> (Parl\u00a03 of 1996, presented to Parliament on 15\u00a0August 1996). The relevant paragraph of the report (at p\u00a0viii, para\u00a05.5.4) reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i>The Committee, having considered the arguments, disagrees with the proposal to restore the principle of equality.</i> The Committee is of the view that any law that has to be enforced effectively must be devoid of inherent inconsistency. The law must also provide for all cases, ie marriages of long as well as of short duration with their own set of circumstances. Where a marriage is of short duration with no children, the law must not put judges under constraint to incline towards equality when what is equal may not be just. Since the provisions call for judges to take into account all circumstances and to order the division according to what is just and equitable and that the circumstances for consideration have also been enlarged and clarified, the provisions in the Bill are fair. The Bill also makes explicit the recognition of the home-making efforts of a spouse regardless of whether the spouse is working or not. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More importantly, the Minister in charge of the amendment Bill, the Minister for Community Development, Mr\u00a0Abdullah Tarmugi, made it clear beyond any doubt that the presumption in favour of equality of division of matrimonial assets was <i>not</i> part of the scheme of s\u00a0112 of the Act when, in moving the Third Reading of the Women\u2019s Charter (Amendment) Bill, he said: (see <i>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</i> (27\u00a0August 1996) vol\u00a066 at cols\u00a0526\u2013527):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Sir, the [Select] Committee recommends the retention of the provisions in the Bill relating to \u201cDivision of Matrimonial Assets\u201d, after taking into consideration the comments of the representors as well as the Members in the House. The Committee is of the view that any law that has to be enforced effectively must be devoid of inherent inconsistency. <i>The proposed provisions in the Bill allow the court to divide the matrimonial assets in a just and equitable manner after taking into consideration all circumstances of the case, including a homemaker\u2019s contributions. The Bill has also enlarged and clarified the circumstances which the court should take into consideration. As such, it would seem inappropriate that the court would still be required to incline towards equality</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i>Sir, the law must provide for all cases, ie, marriages of long as well as of short duration, and marriages under unusual sets of circumstances. For example, where a marriage is of short duration with no children, the law must not put judges under constraint to incline towards equality when what is equal may not be just. The Committee is of the view that the provisions of the Bill are fair. Indeed, it is a better formulation than the current one.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">The Minister continued as follows (<i>id</i> at col\u00a0542):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I would like to respond to Mdm\u00a0Yu-Foo. She asked whether it would be possible in the current amendment that <i>working women</i> could indeed get a bigger share of the matrimonial assets. <i>The possibility is there, because the court will take into consideration all the circumstances leading to the divorce, including the non-monetary contribution to the home</i>. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is not, in fact, the first time that the courts have referred to the valuable materials cited above. In the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Lau Loon Seng</i> ([50] <i>supra</i>), Kan Ting Chiu\u00a0J also referred to these materials (at [16]\u2013[18]).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would also like to add that the experience of the courts in dealing with division of matrimonial assets shows that equality of division is <i>not</i> the norm (see above at [50]); indeed, in the large majority of the cases decided by the courts, equality of division was not achievable on the facts. This is not surprising given the current social conditions in Singapore, notwithstanding the fact that more and more women work and there is generally more equality in the workplace. We emphasise, however, that the focus of the court is always on the attainment of a <i>just and equitable</i> division of matrimonial assets (as required under s\u00a0112(1) of the Act). We have, consistent with this aim, in fact emphasised (at [39] above) the importance of giving the <i>fullest</i> effect to the non-financial contributions of the spouse concerned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On a general note, whilst there are common guidelines which are embodied within s\u00a0112(2) of the Act (although these are not exhaustive), nevertheless, because fact situations will obviously vary, different courts may arrive at different results. However, whilst such <i>literal</i> differences will undoubtedly exist, it does not necessarily follow that these different results are unprincipled and based on the (unacceptable) exercise of \u201cpalm tree justice\u201d. On the contrary, as was observed in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Chua Kwee Chen, Lim Kah Nee and Lim Chah In v Koh Choon Chin</i> <nobr>[2006] 3 SLR 469</nobr> (at [25]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i>[L]egal practice</i> (<i>viz</i>, the sphere of practical application) <i>necessarily</i> involves <i>discretion</i>. In this particular sphere, discretion is in fact not only necessary but also <i>a great strength</i>. \u2026 [T]he exercise of judicial discretion is generally not only unavoidable but is also desirable, especially in situations such as these. As [was] observed in <i>Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</i> <nobr>[2006] 2 SLR 117</nobr> at [102], \u201c[t]he courts also exercise discretion virtually all the time and exercise such discretion in a structured and fair manner\u201d, citing the very pertinent observations of Chao Hick Tin\u00a0JA (as he then was) in the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <i>Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</i> <a href=\"http://agclwb.agc.gov.sg/main/cases/judg/%5b2005%5d_SGCA_2.html\" class=\"remove\"/><nobr>[2005] 1 SLR 502</nobr> at [81] in relation to the application of equitable principles, and where the learned judge opined that \u201c[t]he courts here, as well as in other common law countries, have been applying equitable principles from time immemorial\u201d; he added that \u201c[w]hile certainty is desirable, it is not an object which should prevail in all circumstances, even against the dictates of justice\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is not more difficult to determine what is \u2018equitable\u2019 than what is \u2018reasonable\u2019 at common law\u201d. [emphasis in original]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We observe that until Parliament changes its mind with regard to s\u00a0112 of the Act and amends it accordingly, we would wish to discourage the perpetuation of the proposition to the effect that equality of division is either the starting point or the norm in any given case, as this could induce in the judge concerned a state of mind that seeks to achieve equality as the norm as the end point, regardless of the actual facts and merits concerned. This would be wrong in law as it is contrary to the legislative intent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we would observe that whilst equality of division of matrimonial assets in our courts is not the <i>norm</i>, the courts would nevertheless not hesitate to award half (or even more than half) of the matrimonial assets if such a decision is justified on the facts. In this regard, this court\u2019s decision in <i>Lim Choon Lai</i> ([35] <i>supra</i>) is instructive. In that case, the learned district judge had ordered an equal division of the matrimonial home as between the parties (this was, in fact, the only matrimonial asset in issue in this particular case). This decision was affirmed by the High Court, and the wife appealed. This court allowed the appeal, ordering a <i>60%</i> share of the matrimonial home to the wife and a corresponding 40% share of the same to the husband. In arriving at this decision, the court found that the direct financial contributions by the parties towards the purchase of the matrimonial property were substantially the same. <i>However</i>, it then proceeded to find, in so far as the <i>other</i> financial and non-financial contributions were concerned, as follows (at [26]\u2013[27]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i>We had no doubt that in the course of the 30-year marriage, it was Mdm\u00a0Lim [the wife] who bore the main burden of supporting the family and providing for its welfare.</i> She was a determined woman who had worked very hard for her family, and she strove to improve herself in her career. She took on extra work and assignments, such as relief teaching and marking examination papers, in order to augment the family income. From the available evidence, which was not disputed, it could be observed that by May 1996, Mdm Lim\u2019s gross monthly income was about $5,000 while Mr Chew\u2019s [the husband\u2019s] was only about $1,800. Although the parties could not be said to be high income earners, the family was nonetheless able to enjoy a comfortable living. They bought cars and went on packaged tours overseas, and it was apparent that these material comforts were provided largely by Mdm\u00a0Lim. Of course, due recognition should also be given to Mr\u00a0Chew for his contributions. He did what his level of income permitted him to, and he paid for the lesser expenses. <i>In our view, the district judge had been too generous towards Mr\u00a0Chew and had given too much credit to Mr\u00a0Chew\u2019s financial contributions.</i> Whilst he may have paid for part of his daughter\u2019s university education, this could hardly be matched with the level of financial input which Mdm Lim had contributed to the welfare and maintenance of the family.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i>As for the indirect contributions made by the parties, we believed that Mdm\u00a0Lim, being a school teacher, would most probably have had more time to spend with the family and children, whereas Mr\u00a0Chew, who worked as a clerk, would have had a nine to five vocation and would not have been as likely to spare the time.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In the event, the court concluded thus (at [28]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><i>After taking into consideration all the various factors and weighing the contributions, both monetary and non-monetary, made by each party, we were of the view that Mdm\u00a0Lim deserved greater credit for the comparatively larger contributions she had made to the family and marriage.</i> Consequently, we held that <i>a just and equitable</i> division would be for Mdm\u00a0Lim to receive a 60% share in the sale proceeds of 83 Namly Avenue [the matrimonial home] and for Mr\u00a0Chew to have a 40% share. In the result, we allowed Mdm\u00a0Lim\u2019s appeal. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the premises, we allowed the appeal in part (in so far as the issue of the division of matrimonial assets was concerned). However, in so far as the issue of maintenance was concerned, we found it appropriate, in the circumstances, to rescind the order made by the Judge. We also ordered that each party bear its own costs both here and below, with the usual consequential orders to follow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We had initially also ordered that the sum held as stakeholders by Sterling Law Corporation be released to the parties equally. However, after having considered a subsequent letter from Mr\u00a0Lim on behalf of the appellant detailing the various sums involved and payments to date, as well as the respondent\u2019s reply, we find it appropriate to order that this entire sum be released to the appellant. However, we are also of the view that in the light of the fact that we have held that there should be no order as to maintenance, the total sum hitherto paid by the respondent to the appellant as monthly maintenance should be refunded by the appellant to the respondent.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><!-- Conversion Tool Version 4.1.5 --><CaseReport xlink:type=\"extended\" category=\"unreported\" neutralcitation=\"[2013] SGCA 37\" year=\"\" volume=\"\" series=\"\" pageno=\"\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:exslt=\"http://exslt.org/common\">\n  <Metadata id=\"14975-SSP-M\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/[2013] SGCA 0037.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2013-07-09T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2013-07-03T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2013</IndexYear>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>[2013]</Year>\n      <Volume/>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>37</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2013] SGCA 37</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>[2013]</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>37</No>\n      <NCit>[2013] SGCA 37</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <CaseTitle>Lian Hwee Choo, Phebe v Tan Seng Ong</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Lian Hwee Choo, Phebe v Tan Seng Ong</SortTitle><SortDate>2013-07-03T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>Civil Appeal No 136 of 2012</CaseNumber>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram>Sundaresh Menon CJ</Coram>\n      <Coram>Chao Hick Tin JA</Coram>\n      <Coram>Judith Prakash J</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role>Plaintiff</Role>\n        <Name>Lian Hwee Choo, Phebe</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role>Defendant</Role>\n        <Name>Tan Seng Ong</Name>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <AdditionalCaseDetails>\n      <CaseTitle>Lian Hwee Choo, Phebe v Tan Seng Ong</CaseTitle>\n    </AdditionalCaseDetails>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Narayanan Sreenivasan S.C., Stuart Andrew Palmer and Judy Ang Pei Xia (Straits Law Practice LLC) for the appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Lim Kheng Yan Molly S.C., Koh Sunanda Swee Hiong, and Lim Rui Cong Roy (Wong Tan &amp;

In the course of the ancillary matters consequent upon their divorce, a preliminary question arose. This was determined by the Judge dealing with the ancillary matters (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) after the parties were cross-examined on their affidavits. The determination led to the sole issue in this appeal, namely, whether the parties had come to an agreement on the matrimonial assets that could be categorised as one \u201cmade in contemplation of divorce\u201d within the meaning of s 112(2)(e) of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Charter\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"2\" pID=\"p1_2\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">At first instance, the Judge essentially held that such an agreement could be implied from all the relevant circumstances. The wife appealed against this determination. We allowed the appeal and held that there was no such agreement. We now set out the detailed grounds for our decision.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Facts</Heading>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Procedural history</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The parties married in August 1974, and have four adult children. Three of the children were born before 1985. In December 2010, the wife commenced divorce proceedings. In April 2011, the husband consented to interim judgment on the basis that the parties had lived apart for a continuous period of at least three years immediately preceding the filing of the writ of divorce.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In October 2011, the wife filed and served a request for discovery and interrogatories on the husband, in which she asked for the audited reports and lists of assets of companies which the husband had an interest in. The husband refused to accede to the request on the ground that the parties had agreed in 1985 to divide their matrimonial assets and cease community of assets, with both parties thereafter having no claim to future assets acquired by the other during marriage (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d). This was the first time that the husband had alleged the existence of the Agreement. The husband then made a similar request for information relating to the wife\u2019s companies. His request was denied on the basis that the companies concerned were not matrimonial assets.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Subsequently, the husband filed a summons for the determination of the preliminary issue of whether the Agreement had indeed been made in 1985.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Background facts</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">By November 1985 when the Agreement was allegedly made, the parties had already engaged in a number of property transactions. At that time, the husband was working full-time with the Public Utilities Board (\u201cthe PUB\u201d) whilst the wife was a housewife, but they worked together to purchase and re-sell real estate.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In 1980, the parties entered into their biggest transaction. This was the purchase of a plot of land at Jalan Pasir Ria (\u201cthe Jalan Pasir Ria Land\u201d). The transaction was carried out in the wife\u2019s name because the husband\u2019s employment with the PUB made it less convenient for the transaction to be carried out in his name. In November 1982, they sold the Jalan Pasir Ria Land for a profit of $4.018m. The husband and the wife were entitled to half of the profits each, but they deposited their respective shares into a joint bank account.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In 1982, the parties became joint owners of a Housing and Development Board flat. Due to regulations extant then, the parties were not allowed to purchase private property in their own names thereafter. Thus, when they subsequently went on to purchase several other private properties using profits from the sale of the Jalan Pasir Ria Land, they placed the same in the names of the wife\u2019s mother and sister to be held on trust for them (\u201cthe Properties\u201d). The parties also acquired a property in London which was placed in the wife\u2019s name alone.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"9\" pID=\"p1_9\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In January 1984, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore enquired into the sale of the Jalan Pasir Ria Land. As the Jalan Pasir Ria Land was held in the wife\u2019s name, she would have been fully liable for income tax at a rate of approximately 33.3% (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, about $1m) if the profits earned on the re-sale were found to be liable to be taxed as income. The wife alleged that she received no assurances from the husband that he would contribute his share of the tax and that there had been substantial withdrawals from the funds in the joint bank account. She was therefore concerned about her ability to pay any outstanding taxes.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">At around the same time, the wife discovered that the husband was involved in an affair. In anger, she unilaterally cancelled a line of credit which the parties had obtained. This cancellation had a detrimental effect on the cash flow of the husband\u2019s property development business. In early November 1985, the wife left the matrimonial home with their three children, then aged nine, seven and one, with the intention of relocating to London.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"11\" pID=\"p1_11\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband immediately engaged solicitors from Shook Lin &amp; Bok (\u201cShook Lin\u201d) and on 13 November 1985 successfully obtained an injunction preventing the wife from leaving Singapore with the three children. The husband also lodged caveats against the Properties. In turn, the wife engaged solicitors from Harold Seet &amp; Co (\u201cHarold Seet\u201d). The parties, and their respective solicitors, met at Harold Seet\u2019s office on 19 November 1985 in an attempt to resolve the impasse (\u201cthe 19 November Meeting\u201d). The husband wanted the Properties transferred to him immediately and he was also very concerned with the welfare of the three children.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Subsequently, Shook Lin hand-delivered a letter dated 22 November 1985 to Harold Seet (\u201cthe 22 November Letter\u201d). The contents of this letter were directly pertinent to the appeal and the letter is discussed in further detail below (see [31], [32] and [41] below). On 23 November 1985, the wife returned to the matrimonial home with the three children and the parties resumed cohabitation. Meanwhile, the parties, through their solicitors, continued to have discussions regarding the transfer of the Properties and the income tax liabilities. In July 1986, the parties\u2019 relationship broke down again when the wife left. However, she returned subsequently and the parties then continued living together for more than 20 years.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The issues relating to the transfer of the Properties and the income tax liabilities were finally resolved in February or March 1987. Three properties in Singapore were transferred to the husband whilst the wife retained cash in an English account and an apartment in Pepys Hill. It was not disputed that the couple, despite their apparent reconciliation, had thereafter conducted their financial affairs separately. The husband and wife operated their respective property development businesses independently of each other, and did not pool their assets. The only exception was a joint venture regarding the redevelopment of one plot of land, in which each party was entitled to half of the profits. In 1991, the parties had their fourth and youngest child.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The decision below</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In his grounds of decision (cited at [2012] SGHC 255) (\u201cthe GD\u201d), the Judge first noted that there was no signed agreement between the parties setting out all the terms of the Agreement (at [49] of the GD).

The parties and the Judge were fully aware of this aspect and the Judge noted at [55] of his judgment that his finding on the existence of the Agreement was not the end of the inquiry and the court would have to look at all the circumstances to determine how much weight to give to the Agreement.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">To determine whether an agreement of the type specified in s 112(2)(e) of the Charter exists, two elements must be met: first, there must have been an agreement with respect to the ownership and division of matrimonial assets; and second, the aforesaid agreement must have been \u201cmade in contemplation of divorce\u201d.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">With regard to the first element, it is uncontroversial that agreements pertaining to the ownership and division of matrimonial assets ought generally to comply with the various legal doctrines and requirements that are an integral part of the common law of contract (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR and another appeal</Emphasis> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis>\u201d) at [94], where this comment was made <Emphasis type=\"i\">vis-\u00e0-vis</Emphasis> prenuptial agreements within the framework of s 112 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe 1997 Charter\u201d) which is <Emphasis type=\"i\">in pari materia</Emphasis> with s 112 of the edition of the Charter currently in force, and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wong Kien Keong v Khoo Hoon Eng</Emphasis> [2012] SGHC 127 at [20] where this principle was extended to postnuptial agreements within the framework of the current edition of the Charter).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Turning to the second element, the arrangements that the agreement makes for the ownership and division of assets must be intended to apply in the event of a dissolution of the marriage, since s 112 is wholly concerned with the distribution of assets upon divorce. The paradigm case is an agreement reached between feuding spouses who want a clean break. This is illustrated by the decision in the High Court case of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wong Kam Fong Anne v Ang Ann Liang</Emphasis> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 902 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Wong Kam Fong Anne</Emphasis>\u201d) in the context of s 112 of the 1997 Charter. The parties in that case were married in 1958 and had two children. They had led separate lives since 1980, and did not cohabit as husband and wife. In May 1984, they entered into a deed of separation, wherein the husband agreed that the wife was to be sole legal and beneficial owner of the matrimonial home. The deed went on to state that, in the event of a divorce suit, the deed shall be submitted to the court by either party and may be incorporated in the judgment of the court. The deed was not to be invalidated by a temporary reconciliation (save for a written statement signed by both parties cancelling the deed), and was also not to be invalidated by any judgement made by the court. Michael Hwang JC held that the deed was made at a time when the parties had already been separated, and divorce was viewed as a real possibility (though not necessarily in the immediate future). The deed was therefore intended as a comprehensive financial and property settlement between the parties.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"20\" pID=\"p1_20\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It is not, however, necessary that to fall within s 112(2)(e) the agreement has to have been made between parties who are already married and contemplating an imminent divorce. It is clear from the decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis>, which dealt with a prenuptial agreement made shortly before the marriage and some 13 years before the wife filed for divorce, that the divorce need not be imminent or even desired at the time of the agreement. Rather, what is required is that in making the agreement, the parties must have addressed their minds to the issue of how property should be divided in the eventuality of a divorce, notwithstanding the possibility that at the time of making the agreement they had hoped that this eventuality would not arise. Thus, the intention that must be found by the court is that the parties intended for the agreement to exhaustively govern the allocation of matrimonial assets upon the <Emphasis type=\"i\">contingency</Emphasis> of divorce, whenever that might actually happen.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"21\" pID=\"p1_21\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It follows from the foregoing that there can be two types of agreement within the meaning of s 112(2)(e) of the Charter:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_21-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">If an agreement is entered into for the purpose of dividing the assets in the context of a specifically contemplated divorce, that will be an agreement within the meaning of s 112(2)(e) for the purpose of that divorce; but, if for some reason the divorce does not ensue at that time and the parties reconcile and carry on, then that agreement can have no relevance in the event of a later divorce.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_21-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the other hand, if an agreement is a definitive one for the division of assets in the event of a divorce (whenever that might happen and even though it may not be specifically envisaged at the time of the agreement (as is the case in a prenuptial agreement)), the evidence must show that the agreement was intended to have such an effect. If such intention is proven, as it was in <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis>, then that agreement would be admissible under s 112(2)(e).</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"22\" pID=\"p1_22\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The necessary intention envisaged in [21(b)] above may be explicitly stated in a written agreement signed by the parties or clearly inferable from the language of such agreement (as was the case in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wong Kam Fong Anne</Emphasis>). An express clause stating that the agreement pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets is to be binding upon divorce would generally be sufficient to prove the requisite intention. Of course, the requisite intention is to be objectively ascertained; no party should be allowed to renege on an ostensibly binding agreement simply because of unobservable subjective reservations (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Aircharter World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd</Emphasis> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 440 at [30]). The ostensible or expressed intention could, however, be negated by proof of undue influence or incomplete disclosure of assets or other such behaviour on the part of one party which could have had an effect on the other party\u2019s decision to enter the agreement.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the other hand, specific reference to divorce may not have been made in the written agreement. In such a case, a detailed analysis of the facts would have to be undertaken by the court to determine whether the agreement arrived at by the parties was intended to govern what would happen to the matrimonial assets in the event of a divorce.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n          <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wong Ser Wan v Ng Cheong Ling</Emphasis> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 416 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Wong Ser Wan</Emphasis>\u201d) is an example of a case where scrutiny of the circumstances showed that no agreement falling within s 112(2)(e) of the 1997 Charter existed. The parties in that case were married in January 1976 and had three children. The marriage broke down over a prolonged period, during which the parties had dealings and negotiations culminating in a consent maintenance order and various written agreements drafted by lawyers. Pursuant to the terms agreed, the wife withdrew the divorce petition she had filed in 1996. In 1999, however, she filed another divorce petition which eventually led to the issue of a decree of divorce. The gist of the earlier arrangements was that the husband agreed to pay maintenance and irrevocably made certain gifts to the wife. In the divorce that eventuated, the question that arose was whether those earlier arrangements constituted agreements between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets. It was held that the arrangements were not concluded in contemplation of divorce. They were entered into on the husband\u2019s part to prevent a divorce from taking place at that time and on the wife\u2019s part in order to reduce her financial dependence on the husband. Whilst the wife argued that the arrangements had been made in contemplation of divorce (a position that would have been in her favour since the husband was a bankrupt at the time of the ancillary hearing), it was not submitted on behalf of the wife that she had intended that the assets transferred to her pursuant to the arrangements would, in the event of a divorce, constitute her share of the matrimonial assets. To put it another way, the wife had not agreed that she would not make any further claim to a share in the matrimonial assets. The bottom line was that the arrangements were not intended to set out the regime for the division of assets in the event of a divorce.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"25\" pID=\"p1_25\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In essence, therefore, the difference between <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wong Ser Wan</Emphasis> and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wong Kam Fong Anne</Emphasis> was that in the former case the circumstances did not disclose a mutual intention on the part of the spouses that their agreement should conclusively settle the division of matrimonial assets should a divorce eventuate, whilst in the latter such an intention was manifested or inferred.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"26\" pID=\"p1_26\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">An agreement on the disposition of property in the event of divorce does not, <Emphasis type=\"i\">stricto sensu</Emphasis>, oust the jurisdiction of the court because the court grants its imprimatur to such agreements, which are not enforced directly <Emphasis type=\"i\">ex debito justitiae</Emphasis> but indirectly via s 112. Nevertheless, a stringent standard is required because the parties are in effect inviting the courts to place at least some weight on such agreements, and courts could accord significant, or even conclusive weight to such agreements (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis> at [86] and [91]). The courts must thus ensure that the parties had truly intended for the agreement to be binding in the event of a divorce. The phrase \u201cin contemplation of divorce\u201d must be given due weight and act as a filtering device.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Where there is no written document and no clear evidence of parties having verbally concluded an agreement, can an agreement falling within s 112(2)(e) nevertheless be implied? The Judge had held that <Emphasis type=\"i\">Raiffeisen</Emphasis> stood for the proposition that in such a situation, an agreement could be implied from a course of conduct or dealings between the parties or from correspondence or from all relevant circumstances. With respect, the Judge misconstrued <Emphasis type=\"i\">Raiffeisen</Emphasis> and had utilised an overly-broad approach.

The burden of proof on this issue is on the proponent of the implied contract, and in a number of cases claims or defences based on implied contracts have been rejected precisely on the ground that contractual intention had not been shown by that party to exist.

First, the burden lies on the party alleging that the agreement exists to adduce proof that an agreement ought to be implied based on all the relevant circumstances. Clear and cogent proof inexorably pointing towards <Emphasis type=\"i\">consensus ad idem</Emphasis> and an intention to create legal relations is required because of the fundamental proposition that contracts should not be lightly implied. Second, the agreement must be to the effect contended for. In other words, the agreement must have been intended to exhaustively govern the post-divorce allocation of matrimonial assets. This is over and above the question of whether an agreement <Emphasis type=\"i\">simplicter</Emphasis> exists. Even if an agreement pertaining to matrimonial assets is implied, this is not conclusive (or indicative) of the further issue of whether the agreement is meant to exhaustively govern the post-divorce allocation of the said assets.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"30\" pID=\"p1_30\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Due to these hurdles, it would be extremely unlikely for a court to find that an agreement intended to exhaustively govern the post-divorce allocation of matrimonial assets ought to be implied from the behaviour of spouses. Married couples redistribute the ownership of matrimonial assets for all sorts of reasons, oftentimes without intending for the ownership of the same to be cast in stone <Emphasis type=\"i\">vis-\u00e0-vis</Emphasis> each other. The mere fact of inter-spousal transfer of ownership is normally equivocal, and could be construed to have been done for various reasons that have nothing to do with divorce or a severing of the marital connection. As VK Rajah JA observed in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter</Emphasis> [2012] 4 SLR 405 at [108]:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">...

[emphasis added]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For these reasons, there will normally be no justification to prefer the possibility that the transfers <Emphasis type=\"i\">per se</Emphasis> evince an intention for the parties to be bound by the post-transfer allocation upon divorce, over other equally plausible reasons (for instance, tax or estate planning or ring-fencing assets against third party claims).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Analysis of the facts</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"31\" pID=\"p1_31\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Having considered the evidence and the parties\u2019 submissions before us, we came to a different conclusion on the facts than that drawn by the Judge. Whilst we did not have the advantage of seeing the parties, much of the evidence was contained in contemporaneous documentary correspondence and, in this respect, we were in no worse a position than the Judge to assess how such correspondence supported the positions taken by the parties when they came to court some 25 years later. It was firstly notable that there was no express mention of division of the assets in the correspondence between the parties. On the wife\u2019s part, the correspondence showed that she was concerned mainly about her tax liability as she had been the sole registered owner of the Jalan Pasir Ria Land. In general, the correspondence supported the wife\u2019s stand that the Agreement simply concerned a re-arrangement of the legal ownership of various properties (beneficially owned by the parties) which re-arrangement had been demanded by the husband who was concerned that none of his properties were in his name. The letters also indicated that the wife was agreeable to the husband\u2019s demands as long as he was willing to bear his share of the tax liabilities.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"32\" pID=\"p1_32\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The 22 November Letter, which followed the 19 November Meeting, stated that \u201cthe following matters were discussed and agreed upon at the meeting\u201d.

The husband even went so far to say that he would have filed for divorce but for the Agreement. As the husband himself did not have the requisite intention, <Emphasis type=\"i\">a fortiori</Emphasis>, the parties did not come to a consensus <Emphasis type=\"i\">ad idem</Emphasis> and certainly did not have a common intention for the Agreement to exhaustively govern the post-divorce allocation of matrimonial assets.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"37\" pID=\"p1_37\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As for the wife\u2019s intentions at that time, the Judge had found as a fact that the wife had left the matrimonial home in a fit of anger at discovering the husband\u2019s infidelity rather than because of fears or concerns over tax, and that she had wanted to punish the husband for his infidelity by causing him to be without assets, without any credit line, and without a family ([50] of the GD).

There was, however, no mention of divorce in the body of the telex. Furthermore, the telex was sent in response to two earlier letters from Shook Lin dated 22 November and 28 November 1985, where no mention whatsoever had been made of divorce. For these reasons, we were of the view that little weight should be placed on the subject reference in the 6 December 1985 telex.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"39\" pID=\"p1_39\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband also sought to rely on the fact that the wife had held 48% (with him holding the remaining 52%) of the matrimonial assets post-transfer as evidence of the fact that there had been a division of assets made pursuant to an agreement made in contemplation of divorce.

The fact that they never undertook such an exercise, even in a rudimentary form, certainly strengthens the inference that such a division was not on their minds at that time.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"40\" pID=\"p1_40\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Even if we were to disregard the objective documentary evidence, there was, with respect, a <Emphasis type=\"i\">non sequitur</Emphasis> in the Judge\u2019s reasoning as set out in [15] above. The fact that community of assets had ceased during marriage did not necessarily mean that the parties had agreed not to redistribute the assets upon divorce. To put it another way, the mere fact that the parties had arranged their financial affairs in a certain way during the subsistence of the marriage does not, without more, lead to the necessary conclusion that the parties had intended for the post-divorce distribution of assets to be governed exhaustively by the Agreement.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"41\" pID=\"p1_41\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The fact that the parties were both legally represented at all material times was yet another factor that militated against the possibility that the parties had the requisite intention. In the absence of any basis to believe otherwise, it would be safe to assume that the parties\u2019 solicitors would have duly advised them as to their respective rights and liabilities. Their solicitors had also gone to the trouble of documenting the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement in the 22 November Letter. If it had been the parties\u2019 intention for the Agreement to exhaustively govern the post-divorce allocation of assets, this intention would surely have been expressly reflected in either the 22 November Letter or at least one of the subsequent pieces of correspondence. It was improbable that not just one, but two solicitors each representing the interests of a different client would have omitted to document such an important term.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"42\" pID=\"p1_42\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Further, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Raiffeisen</Emphasis> should only be invoked when the very existence of the contract is in dispute because of a lack of documentation and/or a lack of a clear-cut offer and acceptance, in which case all the relevant circumstances would be taken into account to determine both the existence and terms of the contract. Where some of the terms have been explicitly documented in writing, the court is engaged in the exercise of the <Emphasis type=\"i\">implication of terms</Emphasis>, which proceeds on the basis of the absence of express terms. In this situation, the governing principles would be those enunciated in the Court of Appeal case of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Foo Jong Peng and others v Phua Kiah Mai and another</Emphasis> [2012] 4 SLR 1267. Of course, the foregoing does not rule out the situation where reliance is placed on <Emphasis type=\"i\">Raiffeisen</Emphasis> to find a collateral contract which varies an extant written contract, but this is not the case before us.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"43\" pID=\"p1_43\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We found that there was no agreement for the disposition of assets made in contemplation of divorce within the meaning of s 112(2)(e) of the Charter.

I do not have any criminal records. Due to family circumstances and my love for my twin sons, which the court had granted custody to me after my divorce proceeding. In Malaysia, I met a Chinese man by the name of \u201cMok\u201d at a Go-kart track, when I used to go there to do mechanical repairs for their vehicles. I became Mok\u2019s friend. Mok asked me to do a \u201clobang\u201d and asked me whether am I willing to do it. He asked me to carry some \u201cganja\u201d into Singapore, and placed it under Sheares Bridge at Fort Road. I agreed to his request. Mok also told me that on completing the job, I would be paid S$2,000. My mother is divorced, my sister is divorced with 2 children and I am also divorced with 2\u00a0children. I have been working in many places, in several occupations and my income was insufficient to support my family. My father had been away for 6 years and he never come home. I look after the family. I used to sit down and think, and sometimes I cried thinking that why my family should suffer. I had money problem.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> This statement was also admitted in evidence at the appellant\u2019s trial without objection. The six packets of vegetable matter formed the subject matter of the charge on which he was prosecuted and convicted. There was no dispute over the nature or weight of the contents of the packets.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Further statements were taken by the investigation officer from the appellant. Of particular interest was one recorded on 1\u00a0September 2003. In the statement, the appellant alleged that on the day of his arrest while he was still at Tuas Checkpoint, before his motorcycle was searched and the five further packets were recovered, an Indian officer abused and threatened him, a Chinese officer made him kneel and a Malay officer hit his head. It was only after receiving this treatment that he made the statement set out at [4] above. He added that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> I would like to say that I did lie when I was giving the statement to the Indian CNB officer on the day of my arrest. I lied when I said that I took the 6 bundles from the JB \u201cesso\u201d station. The truth was that I took only one packet from the Esso Station. I lied because I do not want anyone to know about the transaction I had with \u2018Mok\u2019 at the \u2018Go-Kart\u2019 track. <i>I lied because I would need to go there to work on a frequent basis. I also know that the people working in the \u2018Go-Kart\u2019 track consumed \u2018Ganja\u2019. As such, I do not want to get them into trouble by mentioning the name</i>. I am now mentioning the \u2018Go-Kart\u2019 track now because I have been thinking about my children when I was in the cell for the past 2 days. I thought that why should I bear the consequences of the 6 bundles of \u2018Ganja\u2019 and who would look after my twin boys. I know that if I were convicted of carrying more than 500 grammes of \u2018Ganja\u2019, upon conviction, I would be sentenced to death. I would like to say that I only carried the smaller block of \u2018Ganja\u2019 found in my haversack because while we were having lunch, \u2018Mok\u2019 did tell me that I would be carrying 200 to 300 grams of \u2018Ganja\u2019. I do not know how the other 5 blocks of \u2018Ganja\u2019 came into my motorcycle.

A person known to him as Ah Seng would inform him when there were repair jobs to be done.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> About three months before his arrest, Ah Seng introduced him to his friend, Mok, who wanted a boat repaired. The appellant asked for the boat to be brought to the track so that he could have a look at it. The appellant, Ah Seng and Mok then smoked cannabis obtained by Mok.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> A month later, Mok informed the appellant that he had brought his boat to the track. The appellant went to the track and examined it and told Mok the parts he needed for the repairs. Mok agreed to get them, and they smoked cannabis together again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> On 29\u00a0August 2003, they met again as Mok had obtained the parts. They had lunch together. During the lunch, Mok asked him if he was prepared to bring cannabis into Singapore for which he would be paid $2,000 for bringing a quantity of 200g to 300g. He agreed to do it, knowing that the death penalty applies where more than 500g of cannabis is imported.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> After lunch, he returned to the track and started work on the boat. While he was working, Mok came and asked him for a knife. He went to his motorcycle which was parked nearby, unlocked one of the carrier boxes with the motorcycle keys which had been left on the motorcycle, and took out a knife from his haversack.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He brought the knife to a container at the track in compliance with Mok\u2019s request. Mok joined him there later. Mok had with him a plastic bag from which he took out two bundles wrapped in newspaper. Using the appellant\u2019s knife, Mok cut the two bundles into six portions. The appellant recognised the bundles to be cannabis, asked Mok how much each bundle weighed, and Mok said the weight was 1kg. Mok also said he was going to make some deliveries.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> After the blocks were cut, he put the knife back into the motorcycle carrier box and resumed work on the boat. He met Mok again while he was working on the boat. He told Mok that he would finish the job by 4.30pm. Mok paid him the agreed repair costs and instructed him to go to an Esso petrol station at 5.00pm to collect the packet of cannabis he was to bring to Singapore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He kept the appointment and met Mok at the petrol station. They went into the toilet of the petrol station where Mok retrieved a packet in a plastic bag from the cistern and handed it to him. Mok instructed the appellant to call him when he had cleared the Singapore checkpoint, and then to take the packet to Benjamin Sheares Bridge and call him (Mok) again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He removed the wet outer plastic bag and placed the packet in his haversack, and bought some prawn crackers from the petrol station. He then placed the haversack back in the left carrier box, from where it was recovered by the ICA officer at the Tuas Checkpoint.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He claimed ignorance of the other five packets recovered.

They shouted at him and hit his head, and Sgt\u00a0Ravichandran slapped him.

He claimed that when it was recorded, he had told the Tamil interpreter that he had knowingly brought in only one packet. The interpreter had asked him if he admitted that six packets were recovered from his motorcycle, and he had agreed and made the cautioned statement, which should be read and understood against that background. He also added that he had told other CNB officers that he had only knowingly brought in one packet, but they did not believe him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Tay\u00a0J rejected his defence. He found that the statement recorded at the checkpoint set out in [4] above was recorded without shouting, intimidation or assault by anyone, and that the cautioned statement set out in [6] above was a full record of all that the appellant had said.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The judge also pointed out that, based on the evidence before him, the street price of cannabis in August/September 2003 was $10 per gram and as the undisputed packet from the left carrier box weighed 218.1g, the value of that packet would be $2,181. After deducting the $2,000 payment to the appellant, Mok would only make $181 out of the transaction. (The judge was being generous in not taking into account the cost of the packet to Mok.) He considered that the $2,000 payment was more likely to be for carrying six packets than one.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The judge also referred to the appellant\u2019s explanation in para\u00a017 of his investigation statement set out in [8] above, and observed that when the statement was made on the day of his arrest, the appellant already knew that there were six packets recovered. If Mok had told him the weight of the cannabis in the one packet he agreed to carry was 200g to 300g, then he must have realised that by admitting that he was knowingly in possession of the six packets, he would face the death penalty, and would not be going back to the track to work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> On appeal before us, the appellant\u2019s counsel, Mr\u00a0Fernando, argued that Tay\u00a0J was wrong to reject the appellant\u2019s defence that he only knew about the one packet of cannabis he agreed to carry, and was ignorant of the other five packets.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> We reject the argument. All six packets were recovered from his motorcycle. When the first statement was recorded from him, he admitted knowledge of the six packets to Sgt\u00a0Ravichandran. At the Police Cantonment Complex, after he was informed that he was being charged with respect to the six packets, he admitted the charge in his cautioned statement without qualification.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It bears repeating that both statements were admitted in evidence with no question raised over their voluntariness. Although the appellant alleged that he was shouted at, hit on the head, slapped and made to kneel (all of which were denied), he did not say that the alleged misdeeds had caused him to make the statements. His explanation was that he lied because he wanted to protect his friends at the track as he needed to continue to work there.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> As Tay\u00a0J pointed out, this was unbelievable because he knew that with his admission he could face the death penalty, and would not be returning to the track to work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> A serious flaw in the appellant\u2019s defence was that he could not give a credible reason for the presence of the other five packets. He thought that Mok might have placed the packets there to frame or cheat him but admitted that he could not say why Mok would do that. It makes no sense for Mok to frame him when he had agreed to transport the drugs for him, or to cheat him by putting five undisclosed packets on his motorcycle which would be discovered if he opened the carrier boxes or the seat compartment to store or retrieve anything such as his haversack, his knife or the prawn crackers he had bought. If it was not Mok or the appellant himself, who would have placed the packets there? There was simply no plausible basis for the six packets to be in the carrier boxes and the seat compartment without the appellant\u2019s knowledge and consent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The undisputed fact that the six packets were found in the motorcycle in the possession of the appellant raised rebuttable presumptions under s\u00a018(1)(a) and s\u00a021 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap\u00a0185, 2001\u00a0Rev Ed) that these packets were in his possession, and under s\u00a018(2) that he knew the nature of their contents.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Tay\u00a0J had examined the appellant\u2019s defence that he actually only knew of the presence of one packet and was ignorant of the other five packets, and had rejected the defence. We found that he was well justified to come to that finding.

On 22\u00a0November 2006, the Wife filed a writ for divorce on the ground of four years\u2019 separation. On 27\u00a0February 2007, an interim judgment dissolving the marriage was made. On 22\u00a0January 2008, the parties settled all ancillary matters at mediation before a district judge and a consent order (\u201cConsent Order\u201d) was made accordingly. Paragraph 5(5) of the Consent Order relating to the division of the Property, a Housing and Development Board (\u201cHDB\u201d) flat, provided, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, that the Property should be sold in the open market, and that the net sale proceeds should be divided in the proportion of 60% to the Wife and 40% to the Husband. As at the date of the Consent Order, there was an outstanding mortgage loan on the Property of approximately $170,000.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Between September 2007 and February 2008, the Husband sought medical attention for his visual problems. On 13\u00a0February 2008 (after the Consent Order was made), his doctor at the National University Hospital confirmed in writing that he was suffering from Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, a condition which left him with very poor vision in both eyes. At the time the Property was purchased, the Husband had taken up the HPIS established pursuant to s\u00a029 of the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap\u00a036, 2001\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cCPF Act\u201d). The HPIS provided that in the event of the Husband\u2019s death or disability, his outstanding liability to repay the housing loan shall be discharged by the Central Provident Fund (\u201cCPF\u201d). As such, on 15\u00a0July 2008, the Husband applied to the CPF Board for a payout due to his disability. On 16\u00a0December 2008, he was certified to be legally blind. On 26\u00a0December 2008, pursuant to the HPIS, the CPF Board paid a sum of $172,740.30 directly to the HDB to fully discharge the outstanding mortgage loan on the Property.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The decisions below</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On 18\u00a0June 2009, the Wife filed an application to enforce para\u00a05(5) of the Consent Order (see above at para\u00a03), <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, that she have sole conduct of the sale of the Property and that the Husband should, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, vacate the Property within one month of the date of Consent Order. On 10\u00a0September 2009, the Husband applied for a variation of the Consent Order, so that he would be solely entitled to the HPIS Payout. He further applied for a variation to the Consent Order requiring the Wife to transfer her interest in the flat to him, after which he would pay the Wife a sum being 60% of the net value of the flat after deducting, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, the HPIS Payout. In other words, the Husband sought to claim that he was solely entitled to the benefit of the HPIS Payout. After hearing both applications together, the district judge (\u201cDJ\u201d) dismissed the Wife\u2019s application and varied the Consent Order. The DJ ordered that the Wife<Superscript/>transfer her title to the flat to the Husband, and that the Husband pay the Wife 60% of the net value of the flat without taking into account the fact that, pursuant to the HPIS Payout, the outstanding mortgage on the Property had been redeemed (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the 60% share of the matrimonial home due to the Wife would be on the basis as if the outstanding loan on the Property had not been repaid by the HPIS Payout).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Wife appealed against the DJ\u2019s decision. On appeal, the Judge varied the DJ\u201ds order and held that: (i) the Husband was <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> solely entitled to the HPIS Payout; and (ii) that the HPIS Payout was not to be deducted for the purposes of calculating the net value of the Property for division between the parties. The Husband appealed against this variation made by the Judge.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Whether the HPIS Payout should be attributed solely to the insured party, such that it should be deducted from the sale proceeds before computing the parties\u2019 respective shares in the matrimonial home</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We found that the Judge was correct in holding that the HPIS Payout was <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> for the sole benefit of the insured party (here the Husband), such that it should not be deducted from the sale proceeds before determining the net worth of the Property and in turn, the parties\u2019 respective shares in it.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">First, the character of the HPIS, as revealed by both the legislative intent and the mechanics of its operation, clearly indicates that a payout under the HPIS pertains to the insured CPF member\u2019s property rather than to the insured CPF member. The HPIS is a mortgage-reducing policy that is specifically targeted at protecting the family home. This was expressly articulated in the course of parliamentary debates by the then Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour, Mr\u00a0Ong Teng Cheong, when the HPIS was introduced (<Emphasis type=\"i\">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</Emphasis> (6\u00a0March 1981) vol 40 at cols 324-325):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Ministry has found that a large majority of CPF members who are using their CPF moneys to repay the mortgages on their flats are not covered by any mortgage reducing insurance policy... Therefore, the establishment of the [HPIS] by the CPF Board would meet a need which insurance companies have failed to meet.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"9\" pID=\"p1_9\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It is clear that the purpose of the HPIS is to reduce the mortgage outstanding on the property, <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> to compensate the insured for his incapacity (here, the blindness of the Husband). A payout under the HPIS is not personal in nature, thereby distinguishing it from a payment under an ordinary life insurance policy. This distinction is borne out by following hypothetical. Suppose that a home owner had fully repaid his housing loan while he was in good health. In the event of incapacity on the part of this particular insured property owner, the insured would not be entitled to receive from the CPF Board a payout under the HPIS. In this regard, it is also pertinent to note that the payout under the HPIS is not made to the insured, but directly by the CPF Board to the HDB. The insured has no control over the use of the monies. It is therefore clear that a payout under the HPIS is not intended as a personal benefit to the insured CPF member to dispose of as he wishes. Additionally, the fact that the HPIS is compulsory for CPF members who have used their CPF monies to pay for their monthly housing loan instalments for the purchase of their HDB flats under the Public Housing Scheme further points to the conclusion that the benefit of the payout is to secure the home for the family in the event that the insured breadwinner should lose his capacity to earn.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Indeed, the manner in which a payout under the HPIS is effected again reinforces the point that the object of the HPIS is to prevent the insured and his family from losing their home if the insured were to meet with some misfortune that would either claim his life or render him incapable of supporting his dependents. As articulated in the following extract taken from the same parliamentary debates (above at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_7\">[7]</ParaXRef>) (<Emphasis type=\"i\">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</Emphasis> (6\u00a0March 1981) vol 40 at cols 325-326):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Members will only be given coverage up to the age of 55 years. This is because at this age members are entitled to withdraw their CPF savings which could be used to pay off the outstanding loans. <Emphasis type=\"i\">Besides, the need for a cover beyond this age is less crucial as such members are unlikely to have young dependent children</Emphasis>. [emphasis added]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"11\" pID=\"p1_11\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Accordingly, it is clear from the parliamentary debates (see above at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_7\">[7]</ParaXRef> and <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_10\">[10]</ParaXRef>) that the HPIS was designed to protect not just the insured, but his dependents as well. As such, we found that the Judge was correct in holding at [23] of his grounds of decision that \u201c[t]he HPIS [P]ayout therefore pertained to the Property and was not intended to be a personal benefit for the Husband although the premium was paid by the Husband.\u201d As the HPIS Payout pertained to the Property, it followed that the HPIS Payout should be factored in to determine the net value of the Property for division in accordance with the Consent Order.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Second, as regards the Husband\u2019s argument that as of the date on which he became entitled to the HPIS Payout, he was already divorced from the Wife, and as such, she should not be entitled to any benefit of the HPIS Payout, we found that it was an argument without any regard to the object of the HPIS. Moreover, we would also underscore the fact that the Wife was still a joint owner of the Property both at the time of the hearing before the Judge and of the appeal before us, and we could not see any reason why the Wife, being a joint owner, should not be entitled to share in the benefits accruing to the Property, such as the HPIS Payout.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Husband further submitted to this court that the only reason he was willing to pay for a 100% HPIS coverage for the loan was that he assumed that his marriage would be intact and his family would benefit. However, this argument is also untenable as the HPIS is both compulsory and statutory in nature. Any person who has an outstanding loan on his HDB flat and has utilized his CPF money to pay for his monthly instalments due on the flat is required to subscribe to the HPIS. Although he could apply for an exemption under s\u00a029(4) of the CPF Act, the ultimate decision rested with the CPF Board. There was nothing before us which would indicate that had he applied for an exemption his application would likely have been granted. In any case, he did not make any such application. Subscription to the HPIS was not a step taken by him of his own free will. The status of the marriage of the insured would not be a relevant consideration. It is the order of court dividing the matrimonial assets, read with the HPIS, that would be determinative.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As we have stated above at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_6\">[6]</ParaXRef> \u2013 <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_8\">[8]</ParaXRef>, the HPIS Payout pertains to the Property (to protect it in the interest of the family) not just the individual insured. The Consent Order for division of matrimonial assets was for the Property to be sold in the open market with the net proceeds, after settling outstanding liabilities, to be divided between the parties in the ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Wife. Up to the date on which we heard the appeal, the Property had yet to be sold. There was nothing in the Consent Order which stated what else should be included or excluded to determine the net proceeds, other than the outstanding liabilities. As of the date of the hearing before the Judge, there was no more outstanding loan on the Property, the outstanding loan having been repaid by the HPIS Payout. In the circumstances there was nothing more to be deducted from the proceeds of sale to determine the net proceeds of the sale of the Property. The net proceeds would naturally be enhanced and both the Wife and Husband would in turn get more under the division.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"15\" pID=\"p1_15\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We are also unable to accept the Husband\u2019s further argument that the parties had already decided to sell the flat in view of the divorce, he should therefore be solely entitled to the benefit of the HPIS Payout. If that intention was carried out and the sale was in fact completed before any payout was made under the HPIS, then such a payout would not have taken place (as the parties would no longer be owning the Property) and the issue which the Husband raised before us would not have arisen. In that eventuality, both the Wife and the Husband would have been the poorer as a result. But that was not what happened here. We would reiterate that we could not see why the HPIS Payout, which was meant to benefit the family, should as a result of the divorce benefit only the Husband. Indeed, to so hold would give rise to gross injustice to the Wife and the two children whom she has custody of. In view of the legislative policy behind s\u00a0112 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cWomen\u2019s Charter\u201d) which governs the division of matrimonial assets as well as the object of the HPIS, it would not have mattered that the Wife had made no financial contributions towards the payment of the premiums for the HPIS. The Husband\u2019s argument that the Wife made no contribution towards paying the HPIS premium is also without merit.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"16\" pID=\"p1_16\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As the Husband wished, subsequent to the making of the Consent Order, to retain the flat for himself, he stated that if the HPIS Payout was not deducted as per the order of the Judge, he would have had to pay the Wife the amount of $316,000 (being her 60% share) due to the subsequent appreciation of the net value of the Property. In contrast, if the HPIS Payout was to be deducted, he would only have to pay the Wife $216,460. This follows from our holding as a matter of course. He benefits from the enhanced net value of the Property because the outstanding loan had been repaid by the HPIS Payout, and so should the Wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Whether the HPIS Payout was a matrimonial asset</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Husband also argued before us that the HPIS Payout was not a matrimonial asset as it was paid out after the dissolution of the marriage and that, therefore, it should accrue solely to him. Again, we were unable to accept this argument. He was required to subscribe to the HPIS during the subsistence of the marriage. As such, it clearly fell within the definition of a matrimonial asset under s\u00a0112(10)(b) of the Women\u2019s Charter, being \u201cany other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage.\u201d It is clear that an insurance policy purchased by either party during the marriage can be regarded as a matrimonial asset: see Leong Wai Kum, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Elements of Family Law in Singapore</Emphasis> (LexisNexis, 2007) at p\u00a0606. In our view, it was immaterial that the payout was made after the marriage had been dissolved, as the operative time was when the Husband subscribed to HPIS. Furthermore, the HPIS Payout could not be said to be a distinct asset from the matrimonial home as it was inextricably intertwined with the Property, having been given directly by the CPF to the HDB for the sole purpose of discharging the outstanding loan on the Property and in turn the mortgage. In the premises, the Husband\u2019s contention that the HPIS Payout was distinct from the matrimonial home and was not a matrimonial asset was without basis.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Observations</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Before we conclude, we would state that we recognise that this ruling could pose challenging issues in different circumstances. Take, for instance, the case where the husband was permitted to retain the matrimonial flat and was ordered to pay the wife a certain percentage of the net proceeds. Assuming that payment to the wife of her share was duly made and that the flat became the sole property of the husband (regardless of whether the flat was originally in the husband\u2019s sole name or in joint names with the wife). A year later, the husband met with an accident which rendered him permanently incapacitated. A payout under the HPIS was made to discharge his outstanding loan on the flat. Query: would the ex-wife be entitled to a share of that payout? Would the answer be different if instead of the incapacity being caused by an accident, it was brought about by a pre-existing medical condition? These are delicate questions which fortunately do not arise here and thus we are not required to answer them. It would appear, however, that a strong case could be made for the conclusion that there is no basis for  an ex-wife to make such a claim for a share of that HPIS payout, for the following reasons:</Text>\n        <List level=\"1\" type=\"loweralpha\">\n          <LItem>\n            <Label>(a)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">First, the HPIS payout should no longer be considered a matrimonial asset as it came about only after the parties had executed the ancillary order for the division of matrimonial assets, <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the parties\u2019 rights and interests with regard to matrimonial assets have already been determined and enforced. Parties should not be allowed to continue to make claims indefinitely for benefits received by the other party after the division of matrimonial assets has been completed. There is a need for finality, unless fraud is shown.</Text>\n          </LItem>\n          <LItem>\n            <Label>(b)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Second, once the husband obtained sole title to the flat after paying the wife her share, the flat would become his exclusive property. Conceptually, it can no longer be regarded as the matrimonial home once the division of matrimonial assets has been completed. At the time the HPIS payout was actually made, the wife would no longer have any interest in the flat. As such, if subsequent to this, a mishap should occur which triggers a HPIS payout, that payout which pertains to the property should accrue to the benefit of the owner at that time, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the husband.</Text>\n          </LItem>\n          <LItem>\n            <Label>(c)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Third, at the time of the mishap, the wife would no longer fall under the category of persons the legislature intended to protect under the HPIS, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the insured\u2019s dependents who face the prospect of losing the roof over their heads.</Text>\n          </LItem>\n        </List>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the reasons above, we dismissed the appeal. However, in the light of the Husband\u2019s wish to retain the matrimonial flat, we gave him an option to do so within 3 months from the date of our order dismissing his appeal. In the event that the Husband should decide to retain the flat then immediate steps must be taken by him (including the obtaining of objective evidence as to the value of the flat) to pay to the Wife her due share. As the Wife had agreed to waive costs, we made no order in that regard except that the Husband should pay the Wife reasonable disbursements in relation to this appeal.</Text>\n      </Para>\n

They had three children who were aged 16, 18 and 22 at the time of the proceedings in the court below. The eldest child, a daughter, studies architecture in Australia; while the two sons study here. In August 1996, the Husband purchased an apartment at 53\u00a0Hume Avenue #07-02 Parc Palais (\u201cthe Parc Palais flat\u201d), which served as the home of the couple and their children. In July 2003, however, the Husband left the matrimonial home to live with Ms\u00a0Sun Chang Yun.

Having been purchased for $1.134m, a valuation adduced in evidence showed that, as of 2002, its value was only $853,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It appeared from the documents that the Husband had had difficulty servicing the loans since December 2003. This state of affairs could not continue indefinitely. It was also clear that the Husband (and the Wife) had been living on borrowed money for some time; he was spending more than his monthly income.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It therefore made economic sense to sell the property even at a loss, so as to reduce his monthly expenditure and liability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the meantime, the Wife could use the balance of the sales proceeds to procure alternative accommodation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was not an ideal solution but it was the most pragmatic under the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the maintenance sum ordered and/or the sales proceeds were insufficient, the Wife had liberty to apply after the matrimonial home was sold. By then, a clearer picture of the Husband\u2019s income and liabilities would have emerged. The Wife\u2019s expenses might also be adjusted because the older son would be serving national service while the daughter would be about to complete or would have completed her studies. This would reduce the Husband\u2019s expenses in respect of her education as well as the Wife\u2019s expenses because the daughter would be relatively self-sufficient then.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ordering the husband to buy another property for the Wife at that time would be pointless because neither the Wife nor the Husband could afford to make such a purchase. In June 2008, however, the parties would have liberty to apply if their financial circumstances had changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the trial judge\u2019s refusal to award the Wife any share in the excluded assets was justified at [35] of the GD, as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Counsel for the Wife had cited <i>White v White</i> [2001] 1\u00a0AC 596 and <i>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</i> <nobr>[2000] 4 SLR 466</nobr> to support her argument that the Wife\u2019s indirect contributions merited her entitlement to half the matrimonial assets. I did not disagree with the principles extracted from those cases. However, every case turns on its own particular facts. Unlike the wives in <i>White v White</i> and <i>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</i>, the Wife did not work and had not worked, since June 1984, which was almost the entire period of the marriage, let alone help the Husband in his work. As the Husband rightly pointed out, she could and should find a job. She should be taking up courses to improve and upgrade her skills instead of spending three to four nights a week doing line dancing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In other words, the trial judge was of the view that whatever had already been apportioned properly reflected the total contributions of the Wife to the family and that it was unnecessary to award her any share in the Husband\u2019s remaining assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>The Wife\u2019s contentions on appeal</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Wife\u2019s arguments in support of her appeal may be summarised in the following terms. As to the orders of the trial judge in relation to the Parc Palais flat (see sub-paras\u00a0(b), (e), (g) and (k) of [2] above), the Wife\u2019s chief grievances are that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge had wrongly concluded that the Husband was in poor financial health and could not afford to continue paying the substantial instalments on mortgage and overdraft loans secured against the Parc Palais flat. Accordingly, the factual basis for ordering the immediate sale of the Parc Palais flat was misconceived.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The overriding consideration in deciding on the disposal of the Parc Palais flat ought to have been the welfare of the children and their need for permanent shelter. As such, the trial judge should have delayed the sale of the Parc Palais flat at least until the youngest child reached 21 years of age.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The balance of the proceeds of the sale of the Parc Palais flat should be given to the Wife without the condition imposed by the trial judge (<i>viz</i>, to use the moneys to secure alternative accommodation at not more than a monthly rental of $2,000 for a period of 24 months) on the basis that she was entitled to that sum as her share of the matrimonial assets for being a dutiful wife and mother for 22 years. Furthermore, the shares awarded to her in the Husband\u2019s dental practice (see [2(g)] above) had only a nominal value since they were in MDC, a private company, and could not be sold in the open market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the excluded assets, the Wife\u2019s central arguments justifying her right to a share in these are that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the Husband could not account for the moneys in the two OCBC Bank accounts (see [4(a)] and [4(b)] above), an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband and the moneys should be counted as part of the matrimonial assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An adverse inference should also be drawn against the Husband to the extent that he could not account for the following insurance policies:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Prudential whole life with profit policy with an unknown surrender value; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the AIA life plan with a maturity value of $30,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Wife was entitled, by virtue of her indirect contributions to the household, to a 50% share in all the assets listed in [4] above. Furthermore, because the shares awarded to her in the Husband\u2019s dental practice (see [2(g)] above) had little value since they could not be sold in the open market, she should be entitled to share in more assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong>Our judgment</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The questions arising in the appeal are as follows. First, should this court interfere with the trial judge\u2019s decision to order the immediate sale of the Parc Palais flat? Second, should the Wife have been given a share in the excluded assets? Third, should this court interfere in the trial judge\u2019s apportionment of the matrimonial assets? Finally, should this court vary the orders of the trial judge to take into account the fact that the shares awarded to her in the Husband\u2019s dental practice cannot be easily realised?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Whether the Parc Palais flat should be sold immediately</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge\u2019s rationale for ordering the sale of the Parc Palais flat was that the Husband was bleeding financially, in part because of the substantial repayments that he had to make in respect of the mortgage and overdraft loans he had secured against the flat. Therefore, the trial judge found that it made economic sense to reduce the Husband\u2019s liabilities as much as possible by selling the Parc Palais flat. Indeed, it would be counterproductive to force the Husband to service the loans on the Parc Palais flat only for him to default eventually, leaving the flat to be sold by the mortgagee in a forced sale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having perused the evidence, we are not convinced that the trial judge erred in ordering the immediate sale of the Parc Palais flat. It was undisputed that the Husband\u2019s monthly expenses were substantial. By the Wife\u2019s own account, the Husband was incurring expenses of between $25,000 and $30,000 per month. The point of disagreement between the parties, however, lay in the Wife\u2019s persistent assertion that the Husband could only have afforded these expenses if he were earning at least as much, if not more. As the trial judge correctly pointed out, this need not be so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Instead, there was evidence that the Husband was struggling to keep afloat. One indication was his income tax returns, which showed that he was earning, on average, only about $10,000 per month. Even at the peak of his earnings in 2002, he was earning approximately $14,000 per month. While the Wife implied that the Husband was not being truthful about the full extent of his earnings, there was no evidence before us that would entitle us to accept her view.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another indication of the Husband\u2019s financial ill health was the fact that he had chalked up not insubstantial amounts of unpaid bills in relation to his credit cards, instalments on various loans, including two secured against the Parc Palais flat, and premiums relating to an HSBC insurance policy. These debts were in excess of $39,000. Again, the Wife contended that because the Husband had been able to settle these debts eventually, he was not in financial hardship. This argument, in our judgment, fails to recognise the simple but significant point that the Husband would not have defaulted on punctual payment had he been financially solvent in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yet another piece of evidence supporting the Husband\u2019s position was the fact that he had taken on a larger loan liability by re-mortgaging the Parc Palais flat for $400,000 and taking out a term loan of $263,943.88 in April 2006. Contrary to the Wife\u2019s assertion, this demonstrated that the Husband was not able to keep on an even keel financially on the basis of his current income alone. Hence, he had a need to borrow substantial amounts of money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the Husband had to close the Balestier branch of his dental practice in July 2004 as a result of declining business. Earlier, in 2002, he had to sell off property he had purchased in Australia because he could not afford the mortgage instalments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we noted the Husband\u2019s explanation that he had lost a substantial amount due to the failure of his attempts to expand his dental practice into China (his estimate of the loss was between US$400,000 and US$500,000). While it is true that there was no documentation of the loss, the Husband explained that this was because he was unable to visit China due to the SARS outbreak in 2003 and his staff there had stolen his equipment. Moreover, the Wife was unable to adduce any proof to contradict the Husband\u2019s evidence that an outstanding loan of $319,037.92 that he had taken from Lloyd\u2019s TSB Bank had been procured for the purpose of financing the unsuccessful business venture in China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge\u2019s finding that the Husband was in financial difficulties was supported by the evidence and there are no grounds for us to set it aside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This finding did not end the matter, however, for the court should also have regard to the welfare of the children, and, in particular, that they should have the security of accommodation: see <i>Chan Choy Ling v Chua Che Teck</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 667</nobr> (\u201c<i>Chan Choy Ling</i>\u201d) and <i>Tham Khai Meng v Nam Wen Jet Bernadette</i> <nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 27</nobr>. Even so, we are not obliged to give pre-eminence to any one factor (see <i>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</i> <nobr>[2000] 4 SLR 466</nobr> (\u201c<i>Yow Mee Lan</i>\u201d) at [32]). In <i>Chan Choy Ling</i>, this court held that it was proper to consider the practicality and justice of avoiding the sale of the matrimonial property (at 673, [18]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We now turn to the factors which should be taken into account in effecting a division of the property. First, one of the factors to be considered as spelled out in s\u00a0106(2)(c) [of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1970\u00a0Rev Ed)] is the needs of the minor children. ... There is no doubt that the wife and the children need a roof over their heads. They have been staying in that house for the last 10\u00a0years. We should avoid, <i>if practicable and just to do so</i>, a disposal of the house and a division of the proceeds of sale between the husband and the wife. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, we have to consider whether a delay of the sale of the Parc Palais flat until the youngest child reaches 21 years of age, as the Wife requested, would be the practical and just thing to do in the light of the Husband\u2019s financial situation. In the cases cited above, and in the only case relied on by the Wife (<i>Susi Suryani Santoso v Lee Kong Eng</i> <nobr>[1999] SGHC 247</nobr>), the court did not have to grapple with a husband who was facing such severe financial difficulties that he was unable to service the mortgage loan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, there is no inexorable principle dictating that the only way to cater to the welfare of the children is to avoid the disposal of the matrimonial home. The trial judge had taken the needs of the children into account as she had made orders mandating the way in which alternative accommodation should be obtained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the circumstances, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s order that the Parc Palais flat be sold immediately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The order relating to alternative accommodation was the direction that the Wife be given the net proceeds from the sale of the Parc Palais flat and that she use this money to acquire alternative rental accommodation for the family for a period of two years (at a rental of approximately $2,000 a month) after which the question of accommodation for her and the children could be reconsidered by the Family Court. The Wife was not happy with this order. She wanted the proceeds of sale to be given to her outright and for the Husband to provide alternative accommodation. For the reasons given below, we agree that the proceeds of sale should be given to the Wife outright as part of her share of the matrimonial assets. We also agree with the Wife\u2019s submission that it would not be appropriate for her to go back to the Family Court in two years\u2019 time to sort out the issue of her accommodation as making an order for the Husband to provide alternative accommodation could only be done at the time of the divorce proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the moment, the Husband is in no financial position to purchase alternative accommodation for the Wife and children. He will, however, find an improvement in his financial position once the Parc Palais flat and the Ritz Mansion flat have been sold as he will no longer have to pay the mortgage instalments for those two premises. He should, therefore, be in a position to assist the Wife to meet the expenses of alternative accommodation by paying her an extra $2,000 a month as maintenance and we order that the monthly maintenance be increased by this sum. In line with the trial judge\u2019s original order, this additional maintenance amount will only be payable for a period of two years from the time that the Parc Palais flat is sold. By that time, the Wife may have been able to acquire property of her own as a home for the children and, in any case, her financial needs will be more clearly ascertainable. At the end of that period, therefore, the maintenance amount shall revert to the amount of $3,000 per month ordered by the trial judge. Both parties of course will then be at liberty to apply for whatever variation of the maintenance order the circumstances may require and justify.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Whether the Wife should have a share in the excluded assets</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to the various assets that the Wife claims she should have been awarded a half share in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>A sum of $483,478.91 from the OCBC fixed deposit account</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not in dispute that there was a fixed deposit account at OCBC Bank in the sum of $483,478.91. This amount was withdrawn on 23\u00a0August 1999. The trial judge found that these moneys were \u201cmost probably\u201d utilised to settle the Husband\u2019s OCBC overdraft facilities and loans in relation to the Parc Palais flat. The trial judge had called for the Husband\u2019s monthly statements from his banks in order to examine whether he had channelled the moneys to his other accounts. She found no evidence of any such movement. Furthermore, she observed that in 1999, when the withdrawal was made, there was no evidence of any problem in the relationship and thus there was no reason then for the Husband to have hidden away his money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unconvinced, the Wife argued that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whilst the sum of $483,478.91 was clearly utilised to extinguish an overdrawn sum of $476,482.81 in the second OCBC account (see [4(b)] above) as at 23\u00a0August 1999, it was not explained what this latter sum had been utilised for;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the overdrawn sum could not have been applied towards the Parc Palais flat since the Husband had always used facilities of UOB (and later on, RHB Bank) for that purpose; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the court should therefore infer that the sum was part of the matrimonial assets, had not yet been expended and should therefore be accounted for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While it is true that the Husband was not able to adduce documentary proof of how the overdrawn sum from the second OCBC account had been used, or that he had an outstanding loan with OCBC Bank secured against the Parc Palais flat in 1999, there were documents showing that the UOB mortgage that the Wife referred to was taken out only in 2004. What this meant was that there was no evidence directly contradicting the Husband\u2019s position that when he first purchased the Parc Palais flat, he had used OCBC Bank as the mortgagee, and that the disputed moneys were applied towards the second OCBC account in order to pay for the Parc Palais flat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In such a situation, the question arises as to whether it would be proper to draw an adverse inference against the Husband. We consider that the trial judge was correct in rejecting the Wife\u2019s plea to do so. It is well established that in order for a court to draw an adverse inference, there must, in the first place, be some substratum of evidence that establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn. In addition, it must be shown that the person against whom the inference is to be drawn has some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding (perhaps because it is peculiarly within his knowledge). In other words, the court\u2019s ability to draw an adverse inference does not and cannot displace the legal burden of proof that continues to lie with the plaintiff, or, as in this appeal, the Wife.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</i> <nobr>[2000] 3 SLR 405</nobr>, this court observed at [50]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Whether or not in each case an adverse inference should be drawn depends on all the evidence adduced and the circumstances of the case. There is no fixed and immutable rule of law for drawing such inference. Where, as was the case here, the trial judge is of the view that the plaintiffs themselves had not made out their claim to the requisite standard, then no drawing of an adverse inference against the defendants is necessary. <i>The drawing of an adverse inference, at least in civil cases, should not be used as a mechanism to shore up glaring deficiencies in the opposite party\u2019s case, which on its own is unable to meet up to the requisite burden of proof.</i> Rather, the procedure exists in order to render the case of the party against whom the inference is drawn weaker and thus less credible of belief. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That a court does not lightly draw an inference against a party is illustrated by <i>Yow Mee Lan</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>), where the court drew an adverse inference against the wife for making no effort to account for certain funds in her hands, whereas it refused to draw a similar inference against the husband on the basis that, <i>inter alia</i>, there was no reason to suspect that he was not disclosing his assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present appeal, the Wife was only able to present a bare allegation that the moneys in the fixed deposit account were used for some nefarious purpose rather than to pay off a mortgage over the Parc Palais flat. Unlike the wife in <i>Yow Mee Lan</i>, the Husband in this appeal has attempted to explain what happened to the disputed moneys by adducing documents to show that they were applied towards discharging an overdrawn amount in the second OCBC account. While the documentary evidence may not show conclusively that the debt arose in connection with the Parc Palais flat and was secured by it, there would have been no motive in 1999 for the Husband to stash the moneys elsewhere. It was not asserted that problems had arisen in the marriage as early as 1999. This is a situation similar to <i>Shih Ching Chia James v Kay Swee Tuan</i> <nobr>[2002] SGCA 2</nobr>, where this court refused to draw an adverse inference against a party in relation to moneys withdrawn three to four years before the breakdown of the marital relationship because it considered that, at that time, the parties would not have kept proper records of their transactions with a view to having to account for them later. Moreover, in the present case, the trial judge could find no trace of the moneys being funnelled to the Husband\u2019s other bank accounts. The Wife has not been able to convince us that the trial judge\u2019s findings on this point were not supported by the evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Sum of $6,780.22 from the second OCBC account</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the Husband had used the moneys from the OCBC fixed deposit account to pay off the overdrawn sum in the second OCBC account, there was a credit balance of some $6,780.22 in the account. This account was closed on 20\u00a0April 2004 and the moneys transferred to yet another OCBC Bank account, to reduce a then existing overdraft of $11,018.29. Whilst it might seem suspicious that the credit balance was depleted on the same day the decree <i>nisi</i> was granted, it must be remembered that as of that date, the Husband was already in debt to OCBC Bank to the tune of $11,018.29, so in effect the sum of $6,780.22 could not be regarded as a net credit balance. Additionally, as we have stated above, the Husband was living beyond his income and thus it was not surprising that he was in debt to OCBC Bank at the time of the divorce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the Wife cannot make a claim to the sum of $6,780.22 as it had already been spent at the time of the divorce. Moreover, even if we held that this sum should count as a matrimonial asset for the purpose of division, it would still have to be demonstrated why the trial judge was wrong in refusing to award her any share in it: on this point, see [45] to [51] below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Rental received from the Johor Baru property from January 2002 to the present</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge found that, contrary to the Wife\u2019s assertion, the Johor Baru property had not been tenanted since October 2003, as evidenced by a letter from a tenant terminating the lease. She also held that the rental proceeds had been spent, probably to set off the Husband\u2019s debts which started piling up in 2003.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the Wife conceded that there was a letter suggesting that the tenancy was terminated as of October 2003, she insisted that it was \u201cself-serving\u201d. By that, we understood her to imply that the letter was either forged or that the property had been rented out to another person but the tenancy had not been disclosed. No evidence was adduced, however, to support either contention. In respect of the rent collected from January 2002 to October 2003, the Wife was unable to substantiate her assertion that it had not already been spent. Accordingly, there is no basis on which we can reverse the trial judge\u2019s decision on this point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Sale of the Johor Baru property</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Wife prayed for the Johor Baru property to be sold and half of the balance of the proceeds to be awarded to her. The trial judge refused to make an order in these terms for the reasons that the property was charged to RHB Bank to secure a loan of $80,000 and that, in any event, the property would not be worth very much.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, the Wife was unable to establish that the trial judge\u2019s finding, that there was no financial value in forcing the sale of the property given the \u201cmoribund state of the Johor property market\u201d (see [31] of the GD), was against the weight of the evidence. We therefore have no reason to interfere with the decision of the trial judge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>The sum of $78,000 deposited into the account of MDC</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not disputed that the $78,000 deposited into the account of MDC with UOB represented the proceeds of the sale of equipment from the closure of the Balestier branch of the Husband\u2019s dental practice. The question was whether the account in which the moneys were deposited was a personal or corporate account. In this regard, the trial judge was of the view that it was \u201cabsurd\u201d for the Wife to ask for this sum, given that the account belonged to the Husband\u2019s dental practice \u2013 which was a limited company \u2013 and not to the Husband directly. To put it shortly, the account was not his and should not be considered part of the matrimonial assets. The Wife, on the other hand, claimed that the account was his, as shown by his using this account to pay some of his personal credit card expenses and his transfer of a sum of $11,792.30 from this account to his daughter\u2019s account on 14\u00a0February 2005.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the evidence and, in particular, the bank documents clearly supported the trial judge\u2019s holding that the account was a corporate one, and that the Husband was not practising as a sole proprietor. In fact, his dental practice had been carried out under the aegis of MDC since that company had been incorporated in 1989. Therefore, we agree with the trial judge that the moneys in the account belonged to the company owning the dental practice and not to the Husband personally. The Husband\u2019s withdrawal of moneys from the corporate account to pay his personal expenses might have rendered him liable for a breach of fiduciary duties, but such actions did not convert the account into a personal one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Moneys held in local and foreign bank accounts other than those already disclosed</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">40<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i> The trial judge ordered the Husband to authorise the Wife to write to all major local banks, including, but not limited to, UOB, OCBC Bank, DBS/POSB, RHB Bank and Bank of China, to ascertain whether the Husband maintained any accounts or fixed deposits with these institutions. Despite having received responses from these banks, the Wife now seeks a court order authorising her to write to all the banks that she wants to, local and foreign, to check whether the Husband had any other accounts. She also wants half of the credit balance of any account she discovers as a result of this exercise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, there is no merit in this prayer. Given that the Wife has received responses from the local banks, which implies that the Husband has complied with the trial judge\u2019s order to authorise her to write to them, there is no reason why the Wife would need a further court order to write to the local banks again. The Wife has not put forward any basis to justify allowing her to extend her search to the foreign banks. She is fishing and should not be allowed to bother the banks with her queries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"><em>Insurance policies</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the court below, the Wife claimed a half-share in the insurance policies listed at [4(g)] above but the trial judge refused to award her any share because \u201cthe policies had no named beneficiaries but would go to the Husband\u2019s estate, being policies that came under s\u00a073 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap\u00a061, 1994\u00a0Rev Ed)\u201d: see [34] of the GD.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With due respect to the trial judge, we do not see how the fact that the policies had no named beneficiaries was relevant. Rather, if the policies had had named beneficiaries, then there might have been an issue as to whether the Husband was the beneficial owner of the policies. In the present case, since no one else has been named as beneficiary, the Husband cannot deny that the policies belong entirely to him and only he or his estate can benefit from them. Thus, the only relevant question in our view is whether the policies are still subsisting. To this end, while the Husband did not dispute the continued existence of Prudential policies nos\u00a008086078 and 08093454, he deposed that he no longer held the other policies being claimed by the Wife.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect of Prudential policy no\u00a017115857, we are satisfied that the policy has lapsed, as shown by its conspicuous absence from Prudential\u2019s premium notice dated 18\u00a0January 2005 in which the other two Prudential policies were listed as being in force. As for the AIA policy, there was no documentation regarding whether the premiums had been paid or were in force. In the absence of proof that the Husband does not still hold this policy, we draw an inference against the Husband in respect of this policy. Moreover, given that it is a two-year-premium policy (of $11,003.40) with a payout of $30,000 in 2016, it is likely that he may be keeping the policy for himself until it matures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Apportionment of the matrimonial assets</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated above, the Wife has asked for the balance of the proceeds from the sale of the Parc Palais flat, as well as a half share in other assets, on the basis of her contribution to the welfare of the family.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before assessing the specific arguments of the Wife, it is apposite to recall that the division of matrimonial assets involves the sound application of judicial discretion by the judge of first instance rather than any rigid mathematical formulae: see, <i>NI v NJ</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 75</nobr> at [18]. Accordingly, an appellate court will seldom interfere in the orders made by the court below unless it can be demonstrated that it has committed an error of law or principle, or has failed to appreciate certain crucial facts. As was held in <i>Tay Ivy v Tay Joyce</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 893</nobr> at 898, [12], and followed by <i>Lee Bee Kim Jennifer v Lim Yew Khang Cecil</i> <nobr>[2005] SGHC 209</nobr> at [14], there is a presumption that the decision appealed against is correct. More recently, it was stated in <i>MZ v NA</i> <nobr>[2006] SGHC 95</nobr> at [5] that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is true that the court has a duty to ensure a fair result, but it is just as important that there is a consistency in the key principles of adjudication because people must be able to anticipate the law and its application so that they can conduct themselves accordingly. If courts were to make minor adjustments for idiosyncratic reasons, that is one sure way of creating uncertainty. By idiosyncratic reasons I mean those circumstances in which one court might say $40 is adequate pocket money for a 12-year-old child, and another might think that $50 is more reasonable. <i>The privilege and duty of making that call lies with the judge at first instance. If the decision were to be disturbed it must be for a strong reason, for example, that the court misapplied a principle of law, or had clearly made an error of fact that was not only obvious, but also significant, and, thereby, rendered the consequence unfair to the parties</i>. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, to succeed on her appeal, it was not sufficient for the Wife merely to repeat her assertion that she was entitled to a greater share of the assets. In our judgment, the Wife was unable to point to any concrete evidence showing that the trial judge had erred in not giving her a larger share of the matrimonial assets, particularly since the trial judge had already acceded to the Wife\u2019s request to be given half of the Husband\u2019s more substantial assets, including 50% of his CPF savings even though she had made no direct contribution to their acquisition. It is significant that the Wife made no effort to rebut the trial judge\u2019s findings that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Wife had not worked after June 1984, almost the entire period of the marriage;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Wife did not help the Husband in his work; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Wife should seek to improve her skills so as to gain employment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In making this holding, we do not belittle the contribution that the Wife has made to the welfare of the family. Section\u00a0112(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Charter\u201d) obliges the court to take into account the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family. In addition, s\u00a0112(2)(<i>g</i>) of the Charter considers relevant, in the division of the matrimonial assets, any assistance (including non-material assistance) provided by one party that aids the other party in carrying on his business or occupation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This recognition of the importance of non-financial contributions to the welfare of the family does not, however, necessarily entitle a spouse who has made such contribution to a half share in all the matrimonial assets: see, for example, <i>Ng Hwee Keng v Chia Soon Hin William</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 SLR 231</nobr> (where this court awarded the wife a 20% share in assets in respect of which she had made only non-financial contributions); <i>Tan Bee Giok v Loh Kum Yong</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 153</nobr> (where this court awarded the wife approximately 35% of the value of the matrimonial assets); and <i>Ong Chen Leng v Tan Sau Poo</i> <nobr>[1993] 3 SLR 137</nobr> (where this court awarded the wife a 35% share in the matrimonial property for her non-financial contributions). Moreover, the cases relied on by the Wife, namely, <i>White v White</i> [2001] 1\u00a0AC 596 and <i>Yow Mee Lan</i> ([18] <i>supra</i>) are not instructive because the wives in those cases had played active roles in their husbands\u2019 businesses \u2013 an element that is absent in the present appeal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, even though the House of Lords in <i>White v White</i> considered that non-financial contribution to the family was an important factor in the division of matrimonial assets, and even thought that, in many cases, an equal division of the matrimonial assets would be an equitable resolution, it expressly repudiated any notion that there should be a presumption or starting point of equality. On the contrary, Lord\u00a0Nicholls of Birkenhead said (at 599):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">My Lords, divorce creates many problems. One question always arises. It concerns how the property of the husband and wife should be divided and whether one of them should continue to support the other. Stated in the most general terms, the answer is obvious. Everyone would accept that the outcome on these matters, whether by agreement or court order, should be fair. More realistically, the outcome ought to be as fair as is possible in all the circumstances. <i>But everyone\u2019s life is different. Features which are important when assessing fairness differ in each case.</i> [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the present appeal, we are fully aware that the Wife has made an important contribution to the family in her role as a homemaker over a long period of time. The record, in fact, shows that the parties\u2019 children excelled in their academic and extra-curricular activities. Thus, even if she was unemployed for most of the marriage, did not assist in the Husband\u2019s business and made no financial contribution to the purchase of the various matrimonial assets, she is clearly entitled to a significant share of the assets. Undoubtedly, it was for this reason that the trial judge apportioned a half share of the more substantial assets belonging to the Husband to the Wife. For this court to vary the orders given by the trial judge such that the Wife would receive an equal share in respect of the excluded assets (some of which have already been spent or no longer exist) would require more than a bald assertion that she deserved more. It would require showing that the trial judge was wrong in law or in fact. The Wife did not meet this requirement. She made no attempt to explain how the trial judge had exercised her discretion improperly. As a consequence, we are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in her estimation of the Wife\u2019s total contribution to the family in the overall division of the matrimonial assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><em>Whether the trial judge\u2019s orders should be varied to take into account the nominal value of the MDC shares</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It will be recalled that one of the orders made by the trial judge was to award the Wife a 50% share in the Husband\u2019s share of the dental practice. In this regard, we accept the Wife\u2019s complaint that this was, in reality, a meaningless order in so far as the owner of the dental practice was a private limited company and thus the Wife would not be able to encash the Husband\u2019s shares in MDC in the open market when she wants to. In other words, even though on the evidence given by the parties the book value of the MDC shares awarded to the Wife ranges between $29,436.375 and $197,046.625 (depending on whose valuation is accepted), the Wife would have great difficulty in realising even the lower amount since the shares are not freely transferable. The trial judge obviously intended the Wife to gain substantial assets when she made the award in relation to the MDC shares. Since, as a matter of practice, this would be difficult to achieve, we are inclined to vary that order and to replace the award of the MDC shares with an award of other assets which would allow the Wife to realise a monetary return.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To achieve the foregoing, the following variations to the orders made by the trial judge would be appropriate:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Parc Palais flat is to be sold immediately. The balance of the proceeds of the sale of the flat is to be given entirely to the Wife without any conditions imposed on its use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two existing Prudential policies (nos\u00a008086078 and 08093454) and the AIA policy are to be immediately assigned by the Husband to the Wife and, so that the Wife shall obtain the full benefit of such assignment:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the original policies are to be handed over to the Wife;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Husband or his counsel shall give written notice to the insurance companies notifying them of the assignments effected pursuant to this order;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Registrar shall have the power to execute the assignments and the notices of assignment in the name of and on behalf of the Husband pursuant to s\u00a014 of the Supreme Court Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed) in the event of the Husband\u2019s failure to do so within 21 days of the date of this order; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-3\">(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Wife will be entitled, from the date of the assignment, to dispose of the insurance policies as she sees fit. In other words, she may choose to pay the premiums on the policies in order to keep them, or she may run down their value by using the proceeds of the policies to pay the premiums due, or she may encash them for their current surrender values.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The award to the Wife of a 50% interest in the Husband\u2019s share in MDC shall be rescinded and if the said shares have already been transferred to the Wife, she shall retransfer them to the Husband forthwith and return any scrip that she may have for cancellation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There shall be liberty to apply for further orders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">For the avoidance of doubt, all other orders made by the trial judge which are not inconsistent with the orders set out above and the orders relating to maintenance made in [23] above will remain in force.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our view, the balance of the proceeds from the sale of the Parc Palais flat as well as the surrender value of the two insurance polices listed above will adequately reflect the value of the Wife\u2019s share in the Husband\u2019s dental practice although they may not be exactly equivalent to the book value of those shares. Our decision will also ensure a clean break between the parties in so far as the Husband will be able to keep all of his shares in his business without interference from the Wife as a shareholder. We are also satisfied that the Husband will be able to afford the revised maintenance order once his liabilities are reduced upon the sale of the Parc Palais flat and the Ritz Mansion flat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On these grounds, the appeal is allowed in part. The Wife has only been successful to a limited extent. In these circumstances it would not be correct to award her the full costs of the appeal. In our judgment, it would be fair for her to recover half the costs of her appeal, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n",

over a continuous period of some seven years.

This is especially the case\n                    in the context of the sentencing process. As I observed in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ADF v PP</Emphasis> [2009] SGCA\u00a057 at [218] and [222]:</Text>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>218</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The sentencing process is not \u2013 and ought\n                            not to be \u2013 a mechanistic one. Still less is a decision on\n                            sentencing in a given case arrived at merely by a resort to a prior\n                            precedent or precedents unless the facts as well as context in that case\n                            are wholly coincident with those in the prior case or cases. This last\n                            mentioned situation is, in the nature of things, likely to be rare. The\n                            sentencing process is a complex one where the precise factual matrix is\n                            all-important and where the court is tasked with the delicate process of\n                            balancing a number of important factors centring on both individual (in\n                            particular, in relation to the accused) and societal concerns. Indeed,\n                            the general aims of sentencing (viz, prevention, retribution,\n                            deterrence, rehabilitation and the public interest) embody these various\n                            concerns (see generally Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in\n                            Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2009) at ch\u00a06). Having regard to the\n                            fact that the sentencing process is not a mechanistic one, it ought (as\n                            I have just mentioned) to be a holistic and integrated one that takes\n                            into account all the general aims of sentencing as applied to the\n                            precise factual matrix before the court itself, and in so far as they\n                            are relevant to that particular factual matrix.</Text>\n          </Item>\n        </QuoteList>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>222</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">However, one cannot ignore the second principal\n                            (and, in some ways, contrasting) theme in sentencing, viz, the concerns\n                            surrounding the individual accused. One basic tenet is as logical as it\n                            is fair and commonsensical: that an accused should not be punished\n                            excessively, even if the wider or broader societal concerns might\n                            suggest otherwise. As I have mentioned above, the court has to balance\n                            the factors from both the individual as well as the societal\n                            perspectives. This concern \u2013 that the accused should not receive\n                            excessive punishment \u2013 is often reflected in that time-honoured\n                            adage that \u201cthe punishment should fit the crime\u201d.\n                            Nevertheless, this particular adage cannot be viewed solely from the\n                            individual accused\u2019s point of view but must also take into account\n                            the relevant societal or public context. On occasion, in fact, the\n                            societal concerns are so important that they must be given predominant\n                            (even conclusive) effect. This brings us back to the principle of\n                            balance, always bearing in mind that the entire process must be applied\n                            by the court in as holistic and integrated a fashion as\n                        possible.</Text>\n          </Item>\n        </QuoteList>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[emphasis in original]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"16\" pID=\"p1_16\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Hence, <Emphasis type=\"i\">all</Emphasis>\n                    relevant factors \u2013 both societal as well as individual in nature \u2013\n                    must be taken into account in the context of the relevant factual matrix as a\n                    whole, bearing in mind that, on occasion, the societal concerns may (as stated\n                    in the preceding paragraph) be given predominant (or even conclusive) effect.\n                    This is, in our view, one such occasion. Before proceeding to elaborate further,\n                    we pause to observe, parenthetically, that, whilst bearing in mind the\n                    individual accused\u2019s point of view (in particular, in the context of the\n                    present appeal, the accused\u2019s age), one must also bear in mind the fact\n                    that the victim, too, is an individual who has (in this case) been severely and\n                    repeatedly violated by the accused.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This was, in no uncertain terms, an abhorrent\n                    case comprising a deliberate, systematic and remorseless pattern of sexual\n                    assaults on, as well as sexual abuse of, a young and innocent victim stretching\n                    over a continuous period of some seven years. These wanton and despicable\n                    assaults also involved, on occasion, sadistic acts of perversion committed in\n                    the context of a flagrant breach of trust as well as in a climate of fear. The\n                    psychological scars inflicted on the victim could not have been more severe and\n                    now appear to be indelible (see above at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_11\">[11]</ParaXRef>).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the circumstances, the age of the accused\n                    (which can, depending on the facts, be a mitigating factor (see the decision of\n                    this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">PP v UI</Emphasis> at [78])) pales into\n                    insignificance in the light of what was perpetrated by the accused on the\n                    victim. It is important, at this juncture, to emphasise the important point\n                    referred to above (at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_15\">[15]</ParaXRef>) to the effect\n                    that the sentencing process is not \u2013 and ought not to be \u2013 a\n                    mechanistic one. Indeed, as also mentioned above (also at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_15\">[15]</ParaXRef>), much will turn on the precise facts before\n                    the court in the case at hand. For example, unlike <Emphasis type=\"i\">PP v\n                        UI</Emphasis>, the causal link in the present case between the\n                    accused\u2019s conduct and the harm suffered by the victim was clearly and\n                    unequivocally established. Further, although the forgiveness extended by the\n                    victim to the accused in <Emphasis type=\"i\">PP v UI</Emphasis> was accorded\n                    little (if any) weight, there was no element of forgiveness whatsoever in this\n                    case. Although the lack of violence in the commission of the offences ought not\n                    to be taken into account as a mitigating factor (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">PP v\n                        UI</Emphasis> at [74]), \u201cthe presence of violence would undoubtedly\n                    be an <Emphasis type=\"i\">aggravating</Emphasis> factor\u201d [emphasis added]\n                    (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">PP v UI</Emphasis> at [74]). Indeed, as we have seen,\n                    the accused had in fact remorselessly inflicted violence upon the victim in this\n                    case. Further, although there had also been a pattern of offences committed in\n                    breach of trust in <Emphasis type=\"i\">PP v UI</Emphasis>, the pattern of sexual\n                    assault and abuse of the victim in the present case was, in our view, even more\n                    deliberate, systematic as well as remorseless.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We were, in fact, of the view that this was an\n                    eminently suitable case to impose three consecutive sentences in accordance with\n                    the principles which V\u00a0K\u00a0Rajah\u00a0JA laid down in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ADF v PP</Emphasis> (at [138]\u2013[146]). In particular, in that case,\n                    Rajah\u00a0JA observed as follows (at [146]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026 The discretion given by s\u00a018 of the [Criminal\n                        Procedure Code (Cap\u00a068, 1985\u00a0Rev Ed)], despite the lack of\n                        manifest statutory constraints, is one that must be exercised sparingly and\n                        carefully assessed in relation to the one-transaction rule as well as the\n                        totality principle within the broad context of the material facts. A\n                        decision to impose more than two consecutive sentences ought not to be\n                        lightly made and, indeed, should usually only be imposed in compelling\n                        circumstances. Concurrent sentences are ordinarily called for when there is\n                        a single episode of criminality which results in a number of offences having\n                        been committed. For the avoidance of doubt, I stress that there is, however,\n                        no rule or principle of sentencing that distinct offences committed on the\n                        same day or in the same criminal episode must be made to run concurrently.\n                        On the other hand, the totality principle cannot be unthinkingly invoked to\n                        minimise punishment for those who maliciously pursue a deliberate course of\n                        criminal behaviour. Multiple wrongdoing by a multiple wrongdoer as a general\n                        rule must be viewed more severely than single offending involving similar\n                        offences. The community (and the victim(s)) have suffered more because of\n                        the greater harm done. Often the exercise of this discretion will involve\n                        intuitive (and not mathematical) considerations and calibration that takes\n                        into account the totality of the criminal behaviour. There is no rigid\n                        linear relationship between the severity of the offending and the length of\n                        the cumulative sentence. In my view, an order for more than two sentences to\n                        run consecutively ought to be given serious consideration in dealing with\n                        distinct offences when one or more of the following circumstances are\n                        present, viz:</Text>\n          <QuoteList level=\"2\" indent=\"none\">\n            <Item>\n              <Label>(a)</Label>\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">dealing with persistent or habitual offenders\n                                \u2026;</Text>\n            </Item>\n            <Item>\n              <Label>(b)</Label>\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">there is a pressing public interest concern in\n                                discouraging the type of criminal conduct being punished\n                                \u2026;</Text>\n            </Item>\n            <Item>\n              <Label>(c)</Label>\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">there are multiple victims; and</Text>\n            </Item>\n            <Item>\n              <Label>(d)</Label>\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">other peculiar cumulative aggravating features\n                                are present \u2026 .</Text>\n            </Item>\n          </QuoteList>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In particular, where the overall criminality of the offender\u2019s\n                        conduct cannot be encompassed in two consecutive sentences, further\n                        consecutive sentences ought to be considered. I reiterate that the above\n                        circumstances are non-exhaustive and should not be taken as rigid guidelines\n                        to constrain or shackle a sentencing court\u2019s powers. Beyond this, I do\n                        not think that it will be helpful to spell out how this discretion must be\n                        exercised. Myriad permutations of offending can take place and too dogmatic\n                        or structured an approach would constrain effective sentencing. In the\n                        ultimate analysis, the court has to assess the totality of the aggregate\n                        sentence with the totality of the criminal behaviour.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[emphasis in original]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"20\" pID=\"p1_20\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Turning to the facts of the present case, the\n                    circumstances are certainly \u201ccompelling\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">ADF v PP</Emphasis> at [146]) and merit the imposition of more than two\n                    consecutive sentences. This was certainly a situation where there had been\n                    \u201c[m]ultiple wrongdoing by a multiple wrongdoer\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">ADF v PP</Emphasis> at [146]). Indeed, the accused in this case\n                    certainly did \u201cmaliciously pursue a deliberate course of criminal\n                    behaviour\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">ADF v PP</Emphasis> at [146]), which,\n                    in our view, \u201cthere is a pressing public interest concern in\n                    discouraging\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">ADF v PP</Emphasis> at [146]). More\n                    specifically, in addition to the severe harm that has been caused to the victim\n                    in this case, it is also in the public interest that the accused\u2019s overall\n                    sentence be enhanced, his age notwithstanding, given the deplorable and\n                    systematic nature of his offences. With due respect to the Judge, the sentence\n                    originally imposed fails to adequately encapsulate the heinousness of the\n                    accused\u2019s depraved and wanton conduct, which (as noted above at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_13\">[13]</ParaXRef>) the Prosecution has described as one of the\n                    worst cases of its kind to come before the courts. In our view, the conduct of\n                    the accused, his age notwithstanding, has in the prevailing circumstances to be\n                    denounced in the strongest possible terms.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"21\" pID=\"p1_21\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We therefore allowed the appeal by the\n                    Prosecution and ordered that the terms of imprisonment imposed by the Judge for\n                    the first, 29th and 42nd charges run consecutively. All the remaining sentences\n                    imposed by the Judge were to run concurrently. The accused was consequently\n                    sentenced to a total of 32 years\u2019 imprisonment with effect from\n                    21\u00a0July 2008.</Text>\n      </Para>\n    </Judgment>\n  </Judgments>\n</CaseReport></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><!-- Conversion Tool Version 3.4.0 --><CaseReport xlink:type=\"extended\" category=\"unreported\" neutralcitation=\"[2012] SGCA 22\" year=\"\" volume=\"\" series=\"\" pageno=\"\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:exslt=\"http://exslt.org/common\">\n  <Metadata id=\"13532-SSP-M\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/[2012] SGCA 0022.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2012-04-10T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2012-04-03T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2012</IndexYear>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>[2012]</Year>\n      <Volume/>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>22</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2012] SGCA 22</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>[2012]</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>22</No>\n      <NCit>[2012] SGCA 22</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <CaseTitle>ATT v ATS</CaseTitle><SortTitle>ATT v ATS</SortTitle><SortDate>2012-04-03T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>Civil Appeal No 51 of 2011</CaseNumber>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram>Chao Hick Tin JA</Coram>\n      <Coram>Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA</Coram>\n      <Coram>V K Rajah JA</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role>Plaintiff</Role>\n        <Name>ATT</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role>Defendant</Role>\n        <Name>ATS</Name>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <AdditionalCaseDetails>\n      <CaseTitle>ATT v ATS</CaseTitle>\n    </AdditionalCaseDetails>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Prabhakaran s/o Narayan Nair (Derrick Wong &amp;

She reasoned at\u00a0<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_23 ext\">[23]</ParaXRef> of the GD:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Wife was a homemaker since 1999 and was financially dependent on the\n                        Husband.

While it was true that during the currency of the\n                    marriage, the Husband bore the financial burden of the family, we were unable to\n                    see why that fact should mean that losses suffered by the Husband in his\n                    business venture should be disregarded (and his alone to bear) in determining\n                    the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided between the parties. The approach\n                    taken by the Judge did not seem to accord with fairness or justice. A marriage\n                    is in part an economic union in which each spouse\u2019s financial well-being\n                    is entwined with the other. Just as gains are shared, so should the losses. It\n                    cannot be the case that appreciating assets fall to be divided as part of the\n                    common pool whilst depreciating assets or liabilities incurred in seeking to\n                    enhance the wealth of the family are attributed entirely to the investing\n                    spouse. Adopting such a stance would unfairly penalize the breadwinning party\n                    for every financial loss incurred.

As such, we held that the Judge\n                    was mistaken in holding that the $700,000 loan on DDD was to be borne solely by\n                    the Husband.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">There was another factual point which seemed\n                    to have impacted upon the Judge\u2019s decision and on which we had some\n                    reservations. This concerned the Wife\u2019s role in the two businesses of the\n                    family, PP and [QQ] (\u201cQQ\u201d). The Judge seemed to hold that the Wife\n                    had contributed significantly to these two businesses, such that her interest\n                    could be traced into profits made by these businesses, which in turn were\n                    channeled into capital repayments on MMM (see\u00a0[31] of the GD).

This is\n                    a necessary preliminary to the exercise of the court's matrimonial jurisdiction:\n                    the court should know what are to be divided. Once this is done, the value of\n                    the pool should then be assessed so that the court\u2019s deliberations can be\n                    made with reference to a working quantum. The court will then consider all the\n                    circumstances of the case, including but not limited to the factors listed in\n                    s\u00a0112(2) of the Women\u2019s Charter, particularly the direct financial\n                    contributions as well as the indirect non-financial contributions of each party,\n                    and thereby determine what is the just and equitable proportion. Having gone\n                    through this exercise, it may then proceed to ascertain the most expedient means\n                    of physically executing the division in that proportion. It should be emphasized\n                    that this does not represent a hard and fast procedure which the court must\n                    adhere to in every case involving the division of matrimonial assets, even where\n                    it would be manifestly iniquitous or inconvenient to do so. However, it would be\n                    desirable for the court to bear these steps in mind as it goes through the\n                    exercise of making a just and equitable division.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"16\" pID=\"p1_16\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The present appeal centered on the\n                    distribution of the couple\u2019s three immovable properties.

We have (at\u00a0<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_17\">[17]</ParaXRef> above) set out\n                    what the Judge\u2019s order amounted to in percentage terms.

Moreover, we could not see any basis to say that the Wife\u2019s\n                    indirect contributions to the home and family exceeded the Husband\u2019s input\n                    as the sole breadwinner. There was no evidence to suggest that the Wife had gone\n                    beyond what would normally be expected of her in maintaining the home and caring\n                    for the children. Moreover, the Wife had only been an exclusive homemaker for\n                    the past 10 years (reckoning up to interim judgment), and did not deny that the\n                    Husband shared in some of the parenting duties. Finally, she contributed to only\n                    11.7% of the purchase price of MMM.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_21\">21</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_21\" label=\"21\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This is\n                                computed on the basis of her CPF contribution ($110,326.35) towards\n                                the purchase price of MMM ($943,000).</Text></Para></Footnote> Other\n                    than the moneys in each party\u2019s CPF account, the three immovable\n                    properties were really the bulk of their assets.

In the result, we reassessed the parties\u2019 contributions in order\n                    to determine the just and equitable division.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Whether an adverse inference should be drawn against the\n                Husband</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In this regard, we noted and agreed with the\n                    Judge\u2019s observation that the documentary inconsistencies in relation to\n                    the Husband\u2019s sources of income pointed towards a failure to make full and\n                    frank disclosure (see\u00a0<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_9 ext\">[9]</ParaXRef> of the\n                    GD).

In <Emphasis type=\"i\">NK v NL</Emphasis> [2007]\n                    3\u00a0SLR(R)\u00a0743, the Court of Appeal held (at\u00a0[59], [61] \u2013\n                    [62]) that in drawing such an inference, the presiding court may elect to either\n                    add a specific sum of the undeclared asset to the matrimonial pool for division\n                    or order a higher proportion of the known assets to the other party. This\n                    approach was subsequently reiterated in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong\n                        Lin</Emphasis> (at\u00a0[65]). We agreed with the Judge that an adverse\n                    inference should be drawn against the Husband in this instance, and it should\n                    reduce the proportion of the assets he would otherwise be entitled to. Taking\n                    into account this factor, as well as the considerations set out\n                        in\u00a0<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_23\">[23]</ParaXRef> above, we were of the view\n                    that a just and equitable division of the three immovable properties, excluding\n                    the refunds to be made to each parties\u2019 CPF account, would be 55:45 in\n                    favour of the Husband.

On 4\u00a0August 2011, an Order for\n                    Collective Sale of MMM was made.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_22\">22</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_22\" label=\"22\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Appellant\u2019s Case at p 15.</Text></Para></Footnote> MMM was\n                    sold for $2.8m at the <Emphasis type=\"i\">en bloc</Emphasis> sale, giving the\n                    Wife a <Emphasis type=\"i\">windfall</Emphasis> of about $1m, as the net value of\n                    MMM at the time of the hearing of ancillary matters was estimated\n                    at\u00a0$1.74m. This begged the question as to whether such a subsequent change\n                    in the value of a matrimonial asset could <Emphasis type=\"i\">ipso\n                        facto</Emphasis> constitute a ground for a successful appeal. It should be\n                    emphasized, however, that the determination of this issue was not strictly\n                    necessary for the resolution of the present appeal as we did not think that the\n                    \u201cproperty swap\u201d order of the Judge was just and equitable. We\n                    noted that counsel for both parties agreed that if in fact the division below\n                    was correct, then the <Emphasis type=\"i\">en bloc</Emphasis> sale should not have\n                    any sway on this court. In our opinion, there was patently good sense in this.\n                    If the \u201cproperty swap\u201d order made by the Judge in this case were\n                    held to be just and equitable and had been affirmed by us, we do not see any\n                    basis to review the division on account of subsequent changes in the valuation\n                    of the asset in question. Especially in a volatile market where prices do move\n                    up and down fairly rapidly, there should be certainty and finality. The party\n                    who, under the order on division of matrimonial assets, is given an immovable\n                    property would have to take it subject to all risks or vagaries of the market.\n                    Otherwise, it would only encourage re-litigation at the appeal stage. Thus,\n                    unless there are special circumstances or compelling reasons, the mere change in\n                    value of an asset between the date of the ancillary orders and that of the\n                    hearing of the appeal <Emphasis type=\"i\">per se</Emphasis> should not be a\n                    ground to revisit the division made by the court below.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Our decision on the division of the matrimonial assets</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"26\" pID=\"p1_26\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the light of our decision that the three\n                    immovable properties should be divided in the ratio of 55:45 in favour of the\n                    Husband, the order of the Judge awarding MMM to the Wife had to be set aside.

Indeed,\n                    no mention of the Wife\u2019s future earning capacity was alluded to in the GD.\n                    It was clearly set out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee (alias\n                        Ho Kian Guan)</Emphasis> [1995]\u00a0SGHC\u00a023 (at\u00a0<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_22 ext\">[22]</ParaXRef>) and reiterated in <Emphasis type=\"i\">NI\n                        v NJ</Emphasis> [2007] 1\u00a0SLR(R)\u00a075 (at\u00a0<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_11 ext\">[11]</ParaXRef>) that the Wife should \u201cexert\n                    herself, [to] secure a gainful employment, and earn as much as reasonably\n                    possible.\u201d However, it seemed to us that even if considerations were\n                    given by the Judge as to the Wife\u2019s potential future earnings, it would\n                    probably have made an insignificant difference in the maintenance sum ordered,\n                    at least for the near to middle term. While the Wife is a diploma-holder in her\n                    40\u2019s, she has care and control of three school-going children, especially\n                    the two younger ones who are aged 13 and 9. Moreover, the Wife has been out of\n                    the job market for some 13 years, making it unrealistic or impractical to expect\n                    her to immediately pick up from where she left off before she became a\n                    homemaker, even with the assistance of a maid. In any event, the Husband\u2019s\n                    submission on the issue of maintenance was also hampered by the adverse\n                    inference which had been drawn against him due to <Emphasis type=\"i\">his</Emphasis> failure to fully disclose his true earning capacity\n                        (see\u00a0<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_24\">[24]</ParaXRef> above).

For convenience, we shall\n\ncontinue to refer to them as husband and wife. They have appealed against the orders of\n\nthe High Court relating to custody, maintenance and the division of matrimonial assets\n\nbetween them following the grant of a decree nisi. The wife is asking for a greater share\n\nof the matrimonial assets and an increase in maintenance and the husband for a reduction\n\nof the maintenance awarded and for a say in the education of the children. \n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nBackground</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The parties were married on 21 September 1983. Some thirteen years\n\nlater, on 10 February 1997, the husband moved out of the matrimonial home. In fact, for\n\nsometime before, the wife had already suspected the husband of having an extra marital\n\naffair. On 21 November the same year, the wife petitioned for divorce on the ground of the\n\nunreasonable behaviour of the husband. On 29 July 1998, the wife filed a supplemental\n\npetition alleging adultery on the part of the husband as a further ground for divorce.\n\nEventually, the petition was heard on an uncontested basis. Decree nisi was granted by the\n\nFamily Court on 24 September 1998 dissolving their marriage.</p>\n\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The husband joined Dell Computer Corporation (Dell), a Delaware\n\ncorporation in August 1996. From time to time he received agreements from Dell granting\n\nhim stock options in the company. Under each agreement the husband was granted what was\n\ncalled non-statutory stock options (\u2018stock options\u2019) to purchase a certain\n\nnumber of Dell\u2019s shares which options would vest in the husband on some future dates,\n\ne.g., 1/5 on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the date of\n\nthe agreement. Even where an option had vested, there were also other restrictions placed\n\non the exercise of such options, e.g., there was a final exercise deadline and further,\n\nthe company could determine that during certain periods the options could not be\n\nexercised.</p>\n\n<p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The stock options which are the subject of contention between the\n\nparties fall under the following three situations:- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) stock options which were vested and exercised by the husband by the\n\n  date of the decree nisi, with profits made;<br/>\n\n  (ii) stock options which were vested in the husband but not yet exercised on the date of\n\n  the decree nisi;<br/>\n\n  (iii) stock options which were not vested in the husband on the date of the decree nisi.</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">For ease of reference, they will hereinafter be referred to as the\n\nfirst category, second category and third category stock options respectively.</p>\n\n<p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Family Court, upon the hearing of ancillary matters, made a\n\nnumber of orders. The pertinent ones are the following:- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) The wife shall have custody, care and control of the three children\n\n  of the marriage with reasonable access to the husband;<br/>\n\n  (ii) The husband shall pay maintenance for the three children in the sum of $5,000 each\n\n  and for the wife in the sum of $1,000;<br/>\n\n  (iii) With regard to the first category stock options the wife shall be entitled to 15% of\n\n  those options and consequently of the profits made therefrom. However, there is to be no\n\n  division of the second and third categories of stock options. </p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">We should add that the wife was also given 15% of the Dell shares which\n\n  the husband had bought in the open market as well as those bought under the Employee Stock\n\n  Purchase Plan. For ease of reference, Dell\u2019s shares which were so bought by the\n\n  husband will hereinafter be referred to as the \"purchased Dell shares\". </p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nDecision below</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both the husband and wife were dissatisfied with the above orders\n\nof the Family Court judge (FC judge). The husband appealed to the High Court against the\n\ncustody order only to the limited extent that he should be given a say in the\n\nchildren\u2019s education, i.e., his consent be obtained. He also appealed against the\n\nquantum of maintenance which he was required to pay for the wife and children. The\n\nwife\u2019s appeal related to the quantum awarded for maintenance as well as the division\n\nof the purchased Dell shares and the three categories of stock options.</p>\n\n<p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The High Court judge (HC judge) varied the maintenance sum ordered\n\nby the Family Court by reducing the total amount slightly to $15,000. The amount for each\n\nchild was reduced to $4,000 and that for the wife increased to $3,000. The judge also\n\ngranted the wife a 15% entitlement to the second and third categories of stock options\n\nprovided that the agreements granting those options were executed before the date of the\n\ndecree nisi.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nIssues before us</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us the appeals of both the husband and wife touched on the\n\nfollowing three areas:- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) Dell shares and stock options.</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(a) Are the second and third categories of stock options\n\n    \"matrimonial assets\" within the meaning of s 112 of the Women\u2019s Charter?</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(b) What is the fair percentage to be awarded to the wife in respect of\n\n    the purchased Dell shares and the profits made from the exercise of the first category\n\n    stock options? </p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(c) What is the fair percentage to be awarded to the wife in respect of\n\n    the second and third categories of stock options (if they are matrimonial assets)?</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(ii) Maintenance: what is the correct quantum of maintenance which\n\n  should be awarded to the wife and the children? Furthermore, should the maintenance\n\n  awarded be made payable from February 1996?</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(iii) Education: should the husband be given a say in the education of\n\n  the three children,</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(a) in the event that the wife proposes to send any of the children\n\n    overseas for education, and, </p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(b) on the proposed course and institution of study overseas of each\n\n    child.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</ol>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nEducation </p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We shall take the third issue first as it can be disposed of\n\nshortly. In refusing to accord the husband a say in the education of the children, the\n\njudge below felt that in view of the acrimony between the parties, it was\n\n\"unrealistic to compel the wife to consult and seek the prior consent of the husband\n\non the children\u2019s education. That would be a recipe for disaster.\"</p>\n\n<p>10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While we recognise that there is considerable bitterness between\n\nthe parties, having regard to the way they have fought over ancillary matters, we do not\n\nthink that per se is a sufficient reason to deny the father (the husband) a say in the\n\neducation of the children who are now aged 16 (Cheryl, a girl), 12 (Sean, a boy) and 11\n\n(Valerie, a girl). It is clear that there will not be anything serious for the parties to\n\ndiscuss until the time comes when each of the children is about to finish his/her\n\nsecondary or pre-university education here. Until then, they will presumably follow the\n\nnormal course which is being pursued by students here.</p>\n\n<p>11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, that is indeed what the husband seeks, namely, that\n\nhis consent be sought as to (i) whether a child should be sent for overseas education and\n\n(ii) the course which the child should pursue and the institution of study. If, for\n\nwhatever the reason, it becomes necessary to send a child for further education abroad, we\n\nfind it hard to deny the father a say in the matter, especially when he is expected to\n\nbear the financial burden for the education.</p>\n\n<p>12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, it is our opinion that the interest of the children\n\ndemands that both parents should be involved in determining what is best for them in that\n\nregard. While as between the parties there is bitterness, it does not necessarily follow\n\nthat this would spill over in determining the educational needs of the children. The court\n\nshould not decree an arrangement which gives an impression to a child that either the\n\nfather or mother does not care about his welfare. As we have no doubt that both parents\n\nhave and will continue to have the children\u2019s interest at heart, we do not think that\n\nthere would be any insurmountable difficulties. In the unlikely event that an impasse\n\nshould arise, the assistance of the court could always be sought. We would add that there\n\nis an aspect of the case which demonstrated that the parties had not completely allowed\n\ntheir heart to rule. This is the question of physical care and control. Upon the Family\n\nCourt\u2019s ruling that custody, care and control of the children should go to the wife,\n\nthe husband did not pursue his claim for custody any further. Good sense prevailed. All he\n\nis now seeking is a say in their further education.</p>\n\n<p>13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We, therefore, disagree with the courts below that the father\n\nshould be denied his parental rights as to the education of the children. We hold that the\n\nfather should be consulted and his consent obtained in relation to the two aspects\n\nmentioned in 11 above. If eventually there is really an impasse, the assistance of the\n\nFamily Court could always be sought.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nDivision of matrimonial property</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to the question of division of matrimonial assets,\n\nand specifically in relation to the stock options. To recap, the Family Court granted the\n\nwife 15% of \u2013 \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(i) the purchased Dell shares consisting of 111,100 shares which the\n\n  husband purchased from the open market and 10,821 shares bought under the Employee Stock\n\n  purchase plan;</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(ii) the gain of US$2,573,328 (less tax) which the husband obtained\n\n  upon the exercise by him of the first category stock options.</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">It did not grant to the wife anything in relation to the other two\n\ncategories of stock options.</p>\n\n<p>15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The High Court varied this aspect of the order and granted the\n\nwife a 15% entitlement to all the categories of stock options. The judge was of the\n\nopinion that \"matrimonial assets\" are not confined to tangible assets in as much\n\nas a debt owed to a spouse would be a matrimonial asset if the debt was acquired during\n\nthe marriage.</p>\n\n<p>16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section 112(10) of the Women\u2019s Charter defines\n\n\"matrimonial assets\" to mean \u2013 \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"(a) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both\n\n  parties \u2026. </p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(i) (not relevant)</p>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\">(ii) </p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">(b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one\n\n  party or both parties to the marriage but does not include any asset (not being a\n\n  matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance\n\n  and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by\n\n  both parties to the marriage.\"</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It will thus be seen that the term \"matrimonial assets\"\n\nhas been given a very wide meaning by the legislature to include any asset of any nature,\n\nsubject only to the specified exception. Accordingly, with regard to the second category\n\nstock options, we do not see how it can be disputed that a stock option which is vested is\n\na matrimonial asset as it confers on the optionee the right to purchase a specified number\n\nof shares at a specific price. The difficulty is with the third category stock options.</p>\n\n<p>18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Singapore, the question of the status of stock options has yet\n\nto be addressed by the courts here. However, in the USA, where it would seem that the\n\nscheme of granting stock options was first introduced, there is a fair amount of legal\n\nmaterial on it. But the approaches of the US courts are far from consistent. We will now\n\nexamine some of them.</p>\n\n<p>19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a general observation,it may be said that the object of a\n\nstock option scheme is really for the purpose of attracting and retaining the services of\n\nkey employees of a company by providing an incentive to encourage and stimulate increased\n\nefforts by them, so that if the company does well the employees will also benefit. But it\n\nwould appear that there is no uniformity as to the terms of such a scheme. As King J of\n\nthe California Court of Appeal said in <i>Maria Hug v Paul Hug</i> 1984 Cal App LEXIS\n\n1925:- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">Treatises which describe employee stock options in the context of\n\n  general corporations law strongly suggest that contractual rights to such benefits vary so\n\n  widely as to preclude the accuracy of any but the most general characterization of them.\n\n  Thus, there is no compelling reason to require that employee stock options must always be\n\n  classified as compensation exclusively for past, present, or future services. Rather,\n\n  since the purposes underlying stock options differ, reference to the facts of each\n\n  particular case must be made to reveal the features and implications of a particular\n\n  employee stock option.</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>John Hall v Eileen Hall</i> 1987 NC App LEXIS 3521, the\n\nhusband was on 8 March 1979 granted options to purchase 1,500 shares, of which 500 each\n\nwere exercisable on 8 March 1981, 8 March 1983 and 8 March 1985 respectively. As of the\n\ndate of separation, the husband was entitled to exercise his options to purchase 1,000\n\nshares. On 12 March 1981 the husband was granted rights to purchase 1,200 additional\n\nshares. As of the date of separation, only 400 options could be exercised. On 28 April\n\n1982, the husband received further options to purchase an additional 1,500 shares but none\n\nof which was exercisable as of the date of separation. Again, in March 1983, the husband\n\nreceived an option to purchase 1,200 shares, but none of the options was exercisable at\n\nthe time of separation. In all, the husband was granted options to purchase 5,400 shares\n\nin his company, but at the date of separation he had a vested right to exercise options to\n\npurchase only 1,400 shares. At the date of the hearing of the divorce, the husband had not\n\nexercised any options to purchase any of the shares in the company. It should also be\n\nmentioned that in this case the stock options which were not yet exercised were subject to\n\ncancellation if the husband\u2019s services with the company were terminated for cause.\n\nThe trial judge held that the stock options for all 5,400 shares were marital property.\n\nThe husband appealed against that determination as none of the options had been exercised\n\nas of the date of the parties\u2019 separation; in the alternative he argued that at most\n\nonly the options for 1,400 shares should be classified as marital property. The Appellate\n\nCourt accepted this alternative contention. Martin J said \u2013 \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">We believe that the approach most consistent with North Carolina\u2019s\n\n  equitable distribution statutes is to classify stock options granted (to) an employee by\n\n  his or her employer which are exercisable upon the date of separation or which may not be\n\n  cancelled, and which may, therefore, be said to be vested as of the date of separation, as\n\n  marital property. Options which are not exercisable as of the date of separation and which\n\n  may be lost as a result of events occurring thereafter, and are, therefore, not vested,\n\n  should be treated as the separate property of the spouse for whom they may, depending upon\n\n  circumstances, vest at some time in the future. In our view, this rule more closely\n\n  recognizes the purpose of stock options granted to an employee which are designed so that\n\n  they vest and become exercisable over a period of time; such options represent both\n\n  compensation [***21] for the employee\u2019s past services and incentives for the employee\n\n  to continue in his employment in the future. Those options which have already vested are\n\n  clearly rewards for past service rendered during the marriage, and, therefore, are marital\n\n  property; options not yet vested are in essence, an expectation of a future right\n\n  contingent upon continued service and should be considered separate property. </p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in <i>Barbara Green v Michael Green</i> (1985) Md App\n\nLEXIS 452, the options under two plans were irrevocable and unassignable but they were to\n\nbe exercised over a period of five years on each anniversary date. The options could be\n\nexercised by the employee, even if his employment had been terminated provided such\n\ntermination occurred not more than 90 days before the date of exercise. The options could\n\nalso be exercised by the employee\u2019s estate. At the time of the trial, some options\n\nhad been exercised and it was not disputed that the shares obtained thereby were marital\n\nproperty. But there were some options which were exercisable at the time of trial but not\n\nyet exercised and some were only exercisable after the trial. The trial court took the\n\nview that both the vested and the unvested stock options were valueless as they had no\n\n\"fair market value\". The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, while recognising\n\nthat an unassignable and unsaleable option had no fair market value, nevertheless was of\n\nthe opinion that it was an economic resource, comparable to pension benefits, on which a\n\nvalue can be attributed. The appellate court did not differentiate between the vested\n\nstock options and the unvested options. The approach taken by the court was set out in the\n\nfollowing passage of Karwacki J:- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">As with pension plans, restricted stock option plans like those we\n\n  consider here are a form of employee compensation, providing to the employee the right to\n\n  accept within a prescribed time period and under certain conditions the corporate\n\n  employer\u2019s irrevocable offer to sell its stock at the price quoted. If the employer\n\n  attempts to withdraw that offer, the employee has \"a chose in action\" in\n\n  contract against the employer. We therefore conclude that stock option plans, like other\n\n  benefits in an employee\u2019s compensation package, constitute \"property\" as\n\n  used in the definition of marital property. Furthermore, because the plans in the case sub\n\n  judice granted stock options to the appellee while he was married to the appellant, those\n\n  options were \"acquired\" during the marriage. See <i>Harper v Harper</i>, 294 Md.\n\n  54, 448 A2d 916 (1982). The stock options are therefore marital property under the terms\n\n  of @8-201(e) and as such are subject to valuation and equitable adjustment in the form of\n\n  a monetary award. </p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It may be noted that in Maryland, USA, the term \"marital\n\nproperty\" was defined to some extent like how the term \"matrimonial assets\"\n\nis defined in our Women\u2019s Charter. There, it was defined as \"the property,\n\nhowever titled, acquired by one or both parties during the marriage\" but it did not\n\ninclude property \u2013 \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"(i) acquired before the marriage;<br/>\n\n  (ii) acquired by inheritance or gift from a third party;<br/>\n\n  (iii) excluded by valid agreement; or <br/>\n\n  (iv) directly traceable to any of these sources.\"</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Michael Grich v Tamara Grich</i> (1996) Conn Super LEXIS\n\n3451 the object of the stock option plan was stated to be to provide key employees of the\n\ncompany additional incentives to continue and increase their efforts on the company\u2019s\n\nbehalf and to remain in the employ of the company. It was designed to increase the ability\n\nof the company to attract and retain individuals of exceptional skill. The options could\n\nonly be exercised by the optionee while he remained employed by the company. The Superior\n\nCourt of Connecticut found that the husband \"could not have arrived at his position\n\nat the company as a \u2018key employee\u2019 without the prior concentration of his time,\n\nenergies, and labour in the computer industry, and from the evidence his concerted effort\n\nwas aided significantly by the wife who helped to further his career.\" It held that\n\nthe unvested stock options were part of the marital estate and were subject to equitable\n\ndistribution between the spouses.</p>\n\n<p>24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast, in <i>Bonnie Balanson v Richard Balanson</i>, 2001\n\nColo LEXIS 437, the Supreme Court of Colorado, reversed a decision of the Colorado Court\n\nof Appeals relating, inter alia, to the determination of the status of certain stock\n\noptions. Under the Colorado Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act, a court must make an\n\nequitable distribution of marital property after considering all relevant factors. The\n\nState Supreme Court held that an employee stock option constituted property for purposes\n\nof dissolution proceedings only when the employee had an enforceable right to the options.\n\nTo determine this question, the court must look to the terms of the contract granting the\n\noptions. It said:- \n\n</p><ol>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"If an employee has a presently enforceable right under the\n\n  contract, regardless of whether the options are presently exercisable, such a right\n\n  constitutes a property interest rather than a mere expectancy \u2026 if the contract\n\n  granting the options indicates that they were granted in exchange for present or past\n\n  services, in the situation for instance, where an employer offers stock options as a form\n\n  of incentive compensation for joining a company, the employee, by having accepted\n\n  employment, has earned a contractually enforceable right to those options when granted,\n\n  even if the options are not yet exercisable. On the other hand, if the options were\n\n  granted in consideration for future services, the employee \u2018does not have enforceable\n\n  rights under the option agreement until such time as the future services have been\n\n  performed\u2019\".</p>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the <i>Balanson</i> case, the parties did not dispute the\n\ntrial judge\u2019s finding that the husband\u2019s stock options were granted in exchange\n\nfor future services. The record indicated that the husband had only completed the\n\nemployment required to enforce his right to exercise 62,500 shares. On this basis, the\n\ntrial judge determined that only 21% of the options constituted \"property\". The\n\nState Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the husband had\n\nearned the right to exercise additional options over and beyond those shares.</p>\n\n<p>26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Hahn v Hahn </i>(1995) Ind Appeal LEXIS 1137 the Circuit\n\nCourt found that only the vested stock options granted to the husband by his employer that\n\nwere exercisable upon the date of filing of petition, or that became exercisable before\n\nthe entry of the decree of dissolution, were marital property subject to division. This\n\ndecision was affirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeals of Indiana. They held that\n\nthis determination was most consistent with the statutory scheme. However, the minority,\n\nChezem J, preferred the views taken, inter alia, in <i>Hug v Hug</i> and <i>Green v Green</i>\n\nand held that accrued but unmatured or unvested stock options were marital property which\n\nwere subject to division upon dissolution of marriage. In particular, he concurred with\n\nthe approach adopted by the Washington State Supreme Court in <i>Re Short</i> (1995) 125\n\nWash 2d 865, 890 P.2d 12 which distinguished between stock options granted for present\n\nemployment services and options granted for future employment services. The question of\n\nvesting was not an issue in determining ownership rights upon marital dissolution. He was\n\nof the opinion that the gravamen should be \"whether the options (were) present,\n\nalbeit deferred compensation or future compensation.\"</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nOur determination</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From the above review it can be seen that there is no uniformity\n\nin the US courts\u2019 treatment of unvested or unmatured stock options, with <i>Hall v\n\nHall</i> and <i>Hahn v Hahn</i> deciding that for the stock options to be treated as\n\nmarital property they must be vested in the employee-husband and exercisable by him and\n\nwith <i>Green v Green</i> and <i>Grich v Grich</i> giving it a wider meaning to cover even\n\nunvested stock options<i>. Re Short</i> propounded the criterion by asking whether the\n\nstock options were for past/present service or for future services. But it does appear\n\nthat there was a concurrence of views in all the cases that even in respect of the\n\nunvested stock options, the employee did have a \"chose in action\". </p>\n\n<i>\n\n<p>28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Halsbury\u2019s Law of England, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition Reissue,\n\nVol 6, para 8,</p></i> listed \"an option to purchase shares\" as a chose in action.\n\nOf course, a contract to grant an option upon the fulfilment of a condition is one step\n\nremoved from having a present option to purchase shares. Still, so long as the grantor may\n\nonly revoke the agreement to grant an option with cause, the grantee under the agreement\n\nhas a valuable right, a contractual right, and that is an asset, even though its exact\n\nvalue may be hard to determine. We agree with the HC judge that one should differentiate\n\nbetween the question of the existence of an asset from the difficulties of evaluating that\n\nasset.\n\n<p>29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having regard to the very wide definition which is given in s 112\n\nto the term \"matrimonial assets\" it is our opinion that it encompasses a\n\n\"chose in action\", including an agreement which gives an employee-husband the\n\nright to subscribe to shares, subject to his continued service with the company for a\n\nspecified future period.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nApportionment</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning now to the question of apportionment, the wife seeks a\n\n30% of the purchased Dell shares instead of only 15% granted by the Family Court. Like the\n\nmatrimonial home, she says she should be given a 30% share representing her indirect\n\ncontribution. She also seeks 30% of the profits obtained by the husband from the exercise\n\nof the first category stock options.</p>\n\n<p>31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The way the judge below differentiated between the matrimonial\n\nhome and the stock options was this. The matrimonial home was acquired when the marriage\n\nhad not broken down. However, the same clearly cannot be said about the stock options,\n\nbecause even at the time of the first agreement to grant stock options to the husband on\n\n12 August 1996, the marriage was already on the brink of breakdown. It was barely six\n\nmonths later that the husband left the home in February 1997. Indeed, from 1994, when the\n\nhusband was with his previous employer, Quonum, the wife had harassed him at his work\n\nplace because of her suspicion that he was indulging in extra marital activities. So,\n\ninstead of helping him in his work, she was doing just the reverse. These were the\n\nconsiderations which influenced the FC judge and HC judge in awarding a lower percentage\n\nto the wife, instead of 30%.</p>\n\n<p>32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, in this connection, the HC judge noted a significant\n\npositive contribution of the wife. This was the fact that while the husband was in Hong\n\nKong pursuing his career with Dell, she was taking care of the children in Singapore. He\n\nfurther observed that in relation to the marital problems between the parties, the husband\n\nwas not \"as blameless as he would like the court to think.\" We have serious\n\ndoubts whether just because the wife was anxious about her husband\u2019s alleged extra\n\nmarital affairs, and had threatened to contact the Chairman of Dell, her contribution to\n\nthe well-being of the family should be deemed any less and thus her share to the stock\n\noptions should thereby be reduced. The fact remains that, notwithstanding her threats, she\n\ndid not expose the alleged extra-marital affairs of the husband to the Chairman of Dell.</p>\n\n<p>33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More importantly, while he was working in Hong Kong, the wife was\n\nmaintaining the home here for the children and taking care of them. It seems to us that\n\nher contribution to the family was largely no different from what it was before disputes\n\nbetween them arose. It is probably true to say that because of her care for the children\n\nhere, the husband was able to work in Hong Kong and focus on his job. So while he was\n\naway, she was shouldering the burden of taking care of the home and family all by herself,\n\neven though she had a maid to assist her.</p>\n\n<p>34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the threats which was hanging over the husband\u2019s\n\nhead, it seems to us that if there was in fact no basis for the wife\u2019s suspicion, he\n\nwould not and should not have been concerned about them. However, if, in fact, what the\n\nwife suspected was true, then there would really have been cause for him to be concerned,\n\nbut in that event, the blame must squarely fall on him.</p>\n\n<p>35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having said that, it appears to us that there is a need to\n\nfurther differentiate between the purchased Dell shares (111,100 Dell shares from the open\n\nmarket and the 10,821 Dell shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan) which were\n\nbought and paid for by the husband and the profits already made on the exercise of the\n\nfirst category options on the one hand and the second and third categories stock options\n\non the other. The funds for the purchased Dell stocks would probably have come from\n\nsavings. Similarly with regard to the exercise of the first category options, the money\n\nrequired to exercise the options would probably have also come from savings. As we see it,\n\nfor those purchased Dell shares and the profits obtained from the exercise of the first\n\ncategory stock options, the wife\u2019s indirect contributions were largely the same as\n\nthose for the matrimonial home. So for those shares/profits we hold that the wife should\n\nsimilarly be entitled to 30%.</p>\n\n<p>36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the second and third categories stock options, we noted\n\nthe arguments of the husband that there must be certainty of ownership before anything\n\ncould be treated as a matrimonial asset which is divisible; the situations of these two\n\ncategories of stock options are fraught with some uncertainties. While we recognise these\n\npoints, the fact remains that the husband was in possession of contractual rights under\n\nthe stock options agreements. We would reiterate that the fact that there are difficulties\n\nin valuation or division does not render a contractual right any less an asset.</p>\n\n<p>37.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We would hasten to add that even as between the second and third\n\ncategories of stock options, there is a need to differentiate between them. Whereas, in\n\nrespect of the second category options, they were already vested (i.e., already earned),\n\nthe same is not so in respect of the third category options. The husband had to continue\n\nrendering services to Dell beyond the date of the decree nisi to acquire the options. So\n\nin respect of those third category stock options, they were given not just for services\n\nrendered prior to the decree nisi but also for services to be rendered post the decree.\n\nOtherwise there would have been no necessity to post-date the vesting of options. In this\n\nregard, we would adopt the \"time rule\" advocated in <i>Maria Hug v Paul Hug</i>\n\n(supra) by the Court of Appeal of California. The effect of the rule is to treat only that\n\nportion of the stock options as matrimonial assets as is obtained by multiplying the stock\n\noptions in question by the fraction obtained between the period in months between the\n\ncommencement of the husband\u2019s employment with Dell and the date of the decree nisi as\n\nthe numerator and the period in months between his commencement of employment with Dell\n\nand the date when the stock option was exercisable by him as the denominator. Only that\n\nportion of the third category stock options as so computed would be reckoned as\n\nmatrimonial assets.</p>\n\n<p>38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the uncertainties, and the fact that the husband would\n\nhave to make available funds required to exercise the option, there is probably\n\njustification to treat the second and third categories options differently from the first\n\ncategory (which options were really no longer options, as they had been exercised and\n\nprofits made). Taking a broad view of things, we are not persuaded that the apportionment\n\nof 15% in respect of the second and third categories of stock options is so unreasonable\n\n(either being too high or too low) that this Court ought to intervene.</p>\n\n<p>39.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note that in respect of the second and third categories stock\n\noptions, the court below, recognising that the fact that either the stock options might\n\nnot be exercised or might not vest in the husband, granted an \"if as and when\"\n\norder. Effectively, this approach, which is sanctioned under s 112(5)(e) of the\n\nWomen\u2019s Charter, means that the division of these assets was to be postponed until\n\nthe stock options were exercised and profits made. In our opinion, this is entirely fair\n\nand sensible. It recognises the special situation and does not accord any undue advantage\n\nto any party. A similar approach was adopted in <i>Green v Green </i>(supra). </p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nMaintenance</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>40.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We now turn to the question of maintenance for the wife. There\n\nwere two interim maintenance orders. On 13 February 1998, there was a consent order for a\n\nglobal sum of $11,000. Again, by consent it was increased to $14,500 with effect from 15\n\nAugust 1998 with the proviso that this order was without prejudice to the appropriate\n\nmaintenance to be granted upon dissolution of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>41.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The starting point for the consideration of the question of the\n\nmaintenance of a wife must necessarily be the earnings of the parties. The other relevant\n\nfactors which the court should take into account are listed in s 114(1) of the\n\nWomen\u2019s Charter. The wife was, at the time of the hearing before the court below,\n\nearning a basic salary of $4,000 (excluding bonuses) as a Private Client Advisor (from\n\nAugust 1996) with Kim Eng Securities (Pte) Ltd. Before that, in 1993, she was for a short\n\nperiod, the Regional Treasurer at Carnaud Metal Box (Pte) Ltd but she resigned apparently\n\nto look after their three children.</p>\n\n<p>42.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The husband was, at the time of the hearing before the Family\n\nCourt, employed by Dell. There was some conflict in evidence as to the time he commenced\n\nemployment with Dell. The judge below seemed to think it was from January 1997 and on our\n\npart we would accept that. He left Dell at the end of September 2000, after the hearing\n\nbefore the Family Court. For the year April 1999 to March 2000 he earned the equivalent of\n\nabout S$33,200 per month, plus S$24,600 per month as bonus. In addition, he made huge\n\nprofits from the exercise of the first category stock options.</p>\n\n<p>43.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The wife seeks to have the total maintenance sum awarded by the\n\nHigh Court enhanced to $20,000, so that she and the children will each obtain $5,000 as\n\nmaintenance. She argues that she and the children should continue to enjoy the same\n\nstandard of living as they did before the breakdown of the marriage. Though the wife is\n\nnow unemployed, she was at the time of the order of the Family Court, earning a basic\n\nsalary of $4,000 with Kim Eng Securities.</p>\n\n<p>44.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the assets awarded to the wife by the Family Court, as\n\nvaried by the High Court, it is estimated that they were worth some $3.4 million, of which\n\nmore than half is in cash. In the light of our decision herein that her entitlement to the\n\npurchased Dell shares and the profits made on the first category stock options should be\n\ndoubled to 30%, the total assets which she would get will be increased significantly.\n\nBesides, she would also be able to obtain an income from the assets. Taking these\n\ncircumstances into account, we do not think the award of $3,000 per month as maintenance\n\nof the wife could be considered to be either inadequate or excessive. While we are aware\n\nthat she had the capacity to earn substantial salary, it does not appear likely that she\n\nwould be able to return to full-time employment, having to take care of three growing\n\nchildren. The highly paid jobs which she earlier held had required her to travel\n\nfrequently.</p>\n\n<p>45.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning next to the question of maintenance for the children, s\n\n68 of Women\u2019s Charter provides that a parent is under a duty to maintain his children\n\nwith \"such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having\n\nregard to his or her means and status in life.\" Under s 69(4), one of the factors\n\nwhich the court shall take into account is also the standard of living previously enjoyed\n\nby the child. The wife had, in her affidavits, set out the needs of the children, some of\n\nwhich are rather exaggerated. We are not persuaded that $4,000 per month for each child is\n\nso inadequate as not to provide the child with a standard of living which is close to that\n\nenjoyed by him/her before the breakdown of the marriage.</p>\n\n<p>46.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, the wife seeks to back-date the order on maintenance\n\nfrom February 1996 on the ground that it was the time the husband first ceased to provide\n\nfor her and the children. The HC judge was not satisfied that the wife has established\n\nthat the husband had failed to maintain her between February 1996 and 15 February 1998,\n\nthe date of the first interim order. The husband only left the matrimonial home in 1997\n\nand it is inconceivable that he did not support the family from February 1996. Perhaps his\n\nsupport might not be adequate from her point of view. But to say that there was no support\n\nat all from the husband is quite another matter. We are not minded to disturb this\n\ndetermination of the judge below.</p>\n\n<b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nJudgment</p>\n\n</b>\n\n<p>47.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, the appeal of the husband (CA 600059/2001) is\n\nallowed only to the extent that he is granted a say in the education of the children in so\n\nfar as it involves overseas education, as we have held in 13 above.</p>\n\n<p>48.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appeal of the wife (CA 600064/2001) is also allowed to the\n\nextent that, in respect of the purchased Dell shares and the profits made under the first\n\ncategory stock options, her entitlement thereto shall be 30% instead of 15%.</p>\n\n<p>49.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both parties have succeeded only in part, and have failed in\n\nother respects. In determining how costs are to be apportioned, we have taken into account\n\nthe issues which each party had raised and succeeded or failed and the extent to which\n\nwork had to be done in relation to each issue. On this basis, and applying the principle\n\nof offsetting, we think that a fair order on costs would be to require the husband to bear\n\n of the costs of the appeal in CA 600064/2001.</p>\n\n<p>50.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The security for costs furnished by the husband in CA\n\n600059/2001, together with any accrued interest, shall be paid out to the wife\u2019s\n\nsolicitors to account for her costs in CA 600064/2001.

The\n\ndistrict court, which heard the ancillary matters in the divorce proceedings, ordered,\n\ninter alia, that the apartment be sold in the open market and that the sale proceeds,\n\nafter payment of the outstanding mortgage loan and the expenses incurred in the sale, be\n\ndivided in the proportion of 65% to the appellant and 35% to the respondent. On appeal,\n\nthe High Court increased the share of the appellant to 80% of the net balance and reduced\n\nthe share of the respondent to 20%, and in all other respects affirmed the order below.\n\nAgainst this decision, the appellant appealed contending that, on the basis of a just and\n\nequitable division under s 112 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 ed), the entire\n\nproperty should be awarded to her solely. We allowed the appeal and now give our reasons.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nBackground facts</p></b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant and the respondent first met while\n\nthey were both working in a textile company: he was then the manager and she was his\n\nassistant. After they had known each other for about three months, they both left the\n\nemployment of the company at the same time. The appellant went to work as a nurse in a\n\ngovernmental hospital at Thomson Road, while the respondent proceeded to set up his own\n\nbusiness. He started his own textile business trading in garments sometime in January\n\n1969. The appellant assisted the respondent in the setting up of his business by, among\n\nother things, providing him with some monies, which she had saved. The respondent\n\npersuaded the appellant to resign from her job as a nurse and to assist him in his\n\nbusiness, which she later agreed. They were married on 23 June 1969.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent registered his business under the\n\nname and style of International Industrial &amp; Trading Company on 1 July 1969. The\n\nappellant started to work for the respondent at about that time. She took on a variety of\n\nroles, from designing the garments and marketing the company\u2019s products to handling\n\nthe company\u2019s secretarial and accounting needs. In 1971, the respondent extended his\n\nbusiness into manufacturing garments and set up a factory of which the appellant took\n\ncharge. From 1971 to 1977, she worked and lived in the factory. Through her initiatives\n\nand creativity, she \u2018invented\u2019 a novel management method, the\n\n\u2018Colour-Dotted Management Method\u2019, which boosted the productivity of the\n\nfactory. The business grew and at one stage the respondent had over 20 employees. For all\n\nthe work she did, the appellant was not paid a salary or staff allowance. Nor was she\n\ngiven a share of the profits.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They have three children, two sons born on 12\n\nDecember 1970 and 24 May 1972, and one daughter born on 11 August 1973. All of them are\n\nabove 21 years old. Both their sons graduated from a polytechnic, and their daughter\n\ncompleted her university education. The appellant is 54 years old and the respondent 60\n\nyears.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In late 1977 or thereabouts, the appellant\n\ndiscovered that the respondent had an affair with a seamstress in his employ. She left the\n\nbusiness but continued to maintain the marriage for the sake of the children. She became a\n\nprivate tutor, giving tuition to students over extremely long hours at her residence.\n\nApart from giving private tuition, she also had to attend to the usual household chores\n\nlike cooking, washing and looking after the children. By 1984, she managed to save some\n\nmoneys amounting to about $100,000 which she placed on fixed deposits with United Overseas\n\nFinance Ltd and DBS Bank.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, the respondent continued to carry on\n\nthe business, which subsequently ran into difficulties. By November 1980, he was unable to\n\npay the rent for the factory and the salaries of his staff. In March 1982, the factory was\n\nclosed and the business ceased. He sold all the assets of the business but did not pay the\n\nappellant any part of the proceeds of sale. He then left for Indonesia, leaving the\n\nappellant and the children. There, he worked for a garment factory known as PT Busuana\n\nIndah Inter Industri, and was appointed the manager. While he was in Indonesia, he only\n\nreturned once or twice a month and did not provide any maintenance for the appellant and\n\nthe children. It was left to the appellant to maintain herself and the children. The\n\nproduction at the factory of which he was in charge was unsatisfactory. In the following\n\nyear, at his urgent request, the appellant went to Indonesia to help him, leaving her\n\nmother to look after the three children. She helped him implement the \u2018Colour Dotted\n\nManagement Method\u2019 in the factory, and as a result, the factory\u2019s production\n\nincreased significantly; her efforts in the factory saved the respondent his job. She\n\nworked there for about three months and thereafter returned to Singapore.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 1984, the couple decided to buy the apartment,\n\n30 Ah Hood Road, #12-02, Nadia Mansions, Singapore at the price of $500,544. They signed\n\nthe sale and purchase agreement on 20 March 1984 with the developer. The flat was then\n\nstill under development, and it was completed only in July 1985. The parties agreed to pay\n\n40% of the purchase price in cash in four equal instalments, with the balance to be\n\nfinanced by the bank on an overdraft account to be secured by a mortgage over the flat.\n\nThe appellant paid for all the four instalments. It was also the appellant who was mainly\n\nresponsible for servicing the overdraft.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 1986, the respondent\u2019s fortunes again\n\nwaned and he returned to Singapore and worked for the company, Tex Line Associates Pte\n\nLtd. The respondent still did not pay for any of the household expenses; nor did he pay\n\nthe monthly instalments for the apartment. The appellant shouldered the main burden of\n\nmaintaining the family. The respondent\u2019s refusal to contribute to supporting the\n\nfamily and servicing the housing loan caused the couple to have frequent quarrels where\n\nthe respondent behaved aggressively towards the appellant. In 1989, as a result of one\n\nsuch incident, the appellant reported the matter to the police. With the help and\n\nintervention of some of the couple\u2019s mutual friends, the respondent agreed to pay\n\nmonthly a sum of $1,000 towards the household expenses. It was during these times that, on\n\n26 June 1989, the respondent agreed to withdraw $50,000 from his CPF account to pay in\n\npart the term loan owed to United Overseas Finance Ltd (\u2018UOF\u2019). He also agreed\n\nthat a sum of $1,000 be deducted monthly from his CPF account to pay for the instaments of\n\nthe UOF loan with the appellant topping up the balance.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent, however, did pay for his\n\nsons\u2019 polytechnic education using his CPF account, but his sons had since repaid him\n\nfor all the costs incurred. The respondent promised to pay for his daughter\u2019s\n\nuniversity education, but as the finances were often not forthcoming, the appellant ended\n\nup paying a large part of her daughter\u2019s education.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent did not keep his promise to pay\n\nthe monthly sum of $1,000 for the household expenses. In the result, the appellant had\n\ngreat difficulties in trying to service the housing loan and maintain the family. Finally,\n\nin 1990 she resorted to applying to the court for maintenance, whereupon he agreed to pay\n\n$1,260 per month towards the family\u2019s maintenance. An order was made against him for\n\npayment of such maintenance. The figure was arrived at on the basis of what he told the\n\nappellant, that is, that he was earning about $3,000 a month. In actual fact, he earned\n\nmuch more.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge in the High Court found that it was at\n\nabout this time that the appellant took in a number of lodgers who were Indonesia\n\nstudents, and that she \u2018did earn no insubstantial sums\u2019 from such lodgers. The\n\njudge also found that the moneys she earned from \u2018the lodging enterprise\u2019\n\naccounted for the expenditure for the renovations of the apartment that were carried out\n\nand also enabled her to defray the household expenses and the instalments for the housing\n\nloan. There was no dispute on such findings.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent left the family in 1992 without a\n\nforwarding address and defaulted in paying the maintenance ordered by the court. The\n\nappellant could only enforce the payment of the arrears, when he returned to Singapore,\n\nwhich he did in 1994. At that time, upon the respondent\u2019s application, the\n\nmaintenance was reduced to $315 per month on the ground that all the children were by then\n\nsui juris. The respondent defaulted in payment of maintenance again from 1996 onwards. The\n\nappellant was only able to enforce the payment of the arrears in 1999, when he returned to\n\nSingapore. After his return, he filed the petition for divorce based on the fact that the\n\nparties had lived apart for a continuous period of not less than 4 years. The petition was\n\nuncontested, and the decree nisi was granted on 8 July 1999.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant has since discovered that the\n\nrespondent has settled in South Africa, living with a woman, Tso Kum Yung. He and Tso Kum\n\nYung are directors of two companies in South Africa trading in garments namely, Korsum\n\nTrading and Texline Import and Export. The respondent, however, claimed that since\n\nDecember 2000, after Tso Kum Yung had sold her property, he had been working as a farm\n\nassistant and living in the farm. There was no indication that he intended to return to\n\nSingapore.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nThe appeal</p></b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only issue in this appeal was whether the\n\ndivision of matrimonial asset between the parties as ordered by the judge in the High\n\nCourt was \u2018just and equitable\u2019, having regard to all the circumstances of the\n\ncase. On this issue, we turn first to the direct financial contribution made by the\n\nparties for the acquisition of the apartment. The judge found that the appellant had\n\ncontributed in total a sum of $884,857.55 representing 87.7%, and the respondent only a\n\ntotal sum of $123,970.91 representing 12.3%.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, the respondent did not accept this\n\nfinding and disputed the extent of the appellant\u2019s contribution. We found that he had\n\nnot shown that the finding was in error or in any way unsustainable. In our judgment, this\n\nfinding was amply supported by the documentary evidence adduced by the appellant. There\n\nwere documents produced showing that the appellant liquidated two of her UOF fixed\n\ndeposits and two of her UOB Asian Currency Unit fixed deposits to pay for 40% of the\n\npurchase price. She also produced bank statements to prove her contributions to the\n\nmonthly instalments for servicing the mortgage. The statements also showed that she was\n\nthe one who paid for expenses such as maintenance fees, property taxes, upgrading levies,\n\ninsurance and the legal fees incurred in relation to the apartment. Finally, she produced\n\nreceipts evidencing her expenditure on the renovation of the flat.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The documentary evidence adduced by the appellant\n\nwas considered by the judge in some depth. He said at  8:</p></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">8 I go to the substance of the matter. I examined the 14 banking\n\n  documents exhibited in the wife\u2019s affidavit affirmed on 25 October 2000. They proved\n\n  that the husband did not pay any part of the initial deposit of $200,217.60. In 1984 they\n\n  agreed to purchase the flat for $500,544.00, having exercised the option to purchase on 20\n\n  March 1984. The flat was still under development. It was completed in July of the\n\n  following year. The first 4 initial deposits were of $50,054.40 each. The couple had in\n\n  fact agreed to pay for them in equal shares. But the documentary evidence, which she\n\n  sought to adduce, proved that he did not carry out his part of the bargain. She paid the\n\n  initial \"booking fee\" out of her UOF SGD Fixed Deposit Account No.\n\n  606-405-729-1. The balance of $54.40 was withdrawn from her DBS Savings a/c. In April 1984\n\n  the second installment became payable. She again lifted another UOF fixed deposit of\n\n  $50,000 and paid the balance of $54.40 from her DBS Savings a/c. When the 3<sup>rd</sup>\n\n  and 4<sup>th</sup> installments fell due in June, 1984 the husband was unable to pay. The\n\n  wife used her UOB fixed deposit No. 51128 to pay for the third installment. In his letter\n\n  to United Overseas Bank of 6 June 1984 the husband admitted just as much. As for the\n\n  payment of the 4<sup>th</sup> installment, the husband\u2019s letter confirmed that he was\n\n  strapped for cash in his business in Indonesia and again the wife used her UOB fixed\n\n  deposit under receipt No. 51128 to pay for it.</p>\n\n  </blockquote></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\">\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\">He then turned to consider the evidence adduced by the respondent and\n\nconcluded at \u00a010:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"><p align=\"justify\">10 [T]hey proved\n\n  that he did not make any direct financial contributions except for the payment of the lump\n\n  sum and monthly installments from his CPF a/c, which as I had noted, he reluctantly agreed\n\n  because the wife had by then exhausted all her means to pay for them.</p>\n\n  </font>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The judge also relied on a further affidavit filed by the appellant\n\nwhich showed that she had borrowed moneys from an Indonesian lady, Amy Lousiana, who is\n\nthe mother of one the appellant\u2019s borders, to pay for the instalments for the house\n\nand household expenses. The judge said at  11:</p></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">11 On 2 February 2001 the wife sought the admission of another\n\n  affidavit, which she had filed. She wanted to admit the OCBC banking documents, which\n\n  confirmed her version that one of her friends, an Indonesian lady by the name of Amy\n\n  Lousiana, had extended to her financial assistance throughout the years when she needed to\n\n  pay for the flat and house expenses. This lady was the mother of one of the several\n\n  Indonesian lodgers who lived in the flat. The wife had incurred liabilities which she has\n\n  to pay back to Amy Lousiana and this was a relevant factor to take into account.</p>\n\n  </blockquote></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\">\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\">17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge came to the following conclusion at \n\n20:</p></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">20 \u2026 In the end, I accepted the figures submitted by the wife. She\n\n  claimed that she had contributed $884,857.55. The particulars are set out on p 25 of her\n\n  written submissions of 5 March 2001. The husband, on the other hand, contributed the sum\n\n  of $123,970.91 from his CPF a/c, which I agree, is part of the matrimonial assets to which\n\n  the wife is entitled to a share. Her direct contributions totalled 87.7%.</p>\n\n  </blockquote></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\">\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In our judgment, the judge was fully justified in making this finding,\n\nand we agreed with him entirely.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nIndirect contributions</p></b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is not disputed that the appellant made\n\nsubstantial contributions to the welfare of the family and the marriage. The parties were\n\nmarried for some 30 years, although during the last 7 years they lived apart. Since 1978,\n\nthe appellant stayed at home, looked after the children and worked as a private tutor.\n\nLater, she took in boarders to supplement her income. The three children were brought up\n\nmainly by the appellant. The respondent for a great part of the time was an\n\n\u2018absentee\u2019 husband and father. The evidence showed that he had not been a\n\nresponsible husband and father. The appellant maintained herself and the children for the\n\ngreater part of the marriage before she sought a maintenance order from the court in 1990.\n\nThe appellant with her children has been living at the apartment and looking after it\n\nsince its purchase.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the early days of their marriage, the\n\nappellant gave the respondent substantial help in his business without getting anything in\n\nreturn. Such help included giving the respondent financial assistance to set up his\n\ngarment business under the name of International Industrial Trading Company, and giving up\n\nher job to work for the respondent from 1969 to 1977 without any salary or payment. While\n\nshe was working in his factory, she also \u2018invented\u2019 a new management method\n\ncalled the \u2018Colour Dotted Management Method\u2019 which boosted the productivity of\n\nthe factory. When the respondent was in Indonesia and requested for her help, she went\n\nover there to help him implement the management method in a factory, of which he was in\n\ncharge. That increased the productivity of the factory and saved him his job.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nThe respondent\u2019s assets</p></b></i>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were other assets which the respondent must\n\nhave acquired during the marriage and these assets did not appear to have been taken into\n\naccount in the division. These include the respondent\u2019s CPF account (apart from the\n\namounts withdrawn for payment of the flat) and his business assets which he must have\n\naccumulated over the past thirty years. The respondent appeared to have settled in South\n\nAfrica and was quite secretive in his business activities there. The judge in the High\n\nCourt did not accept that he had no assets. Nor did we.</p>\n\n<i><b>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\nDivision</p></b></i></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\" size=\"4\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\"/></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\">21.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge did consider whether he should give to the appellant the\n\nentire matrimonial home but refrained from so doing on account of the respondent\u2019s\n\ncontributions, direct and indirect. He said at  20:</font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">In view of the wife\u2019s substantial indirect contributions to the\n\n  accumulation of the matrimonial assets, I was sorely tempted to accede to her request that\n\n  I award her the entire flat and order him to repay his own CPF, as it would mean that he\n\n  would immediately take out the bulk of it since he is past 55 years old. But I did not do\n\n  so because it would be out of line with an objective view of the facts. He was not totally\n\n  derelict. He did pay for half of the daughter\u2019s education. Though under compulsion,\n\n  he did pay maintenance. He did give money to his son when the latter was in need. He had\n\n  made some contributions. I felt I would fall in error in awarding him no share in the\n\n  matrimonial flat. I therefore awarded him 20% of the net proceeds of sale. The other terms\n\n  of my order are set out in an order which I approved.</p>\n\n  </blockquote></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\">\n\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\">22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, we were unable to agree with the\n\njudge. In the circumstances of this case, an order awarding her the entire apartment would\n\nnot be out of line. There were ample grounds for such an order.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the judge found and we agreed, the direct\n\nfinancial contributions made by the parties towards the acquisition of the flat were as\n\nfollows: 87.7% thereof by the appellant, and 12.3% by the respondent. In addition, there\n\nwere the indirect contributions made by the parties. It is not disputed that the indirect\n\ncontributions made by the appellant were truly substantial. She shouldered the burden of\n\nmaintaining the family for the greater part of the marriage, and worked long hours to\n\nprovide financial means and support for herself and the children. She took on the task of\n\nbring up the children single-handedly. In the course of so doing, she incurred substantial\n\ndebts for the joint benefit of herself and the family and would have to discharge these\n\ndebts herself. During the earlier part of the marriage, she rendered substantial help to\n\nthe respondent\u2019s business without getting anything in return.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that the respondent did pay for half\n\nof his daughter\u2019s university education and his sons\u2019 education at the\n\npolytechnic. But, in our view, these contributions were quite insignificant compared to\n\nthe total contributions made by the appellant to the welfare of the family. The respondent\n\nwas absent during a substantial part of the marriage: he was in Indonesia during the\n\nperiod between 1982 and 1986, and during that period he did not provide any maintenance\n\nfor the family. In 1992, he left the family, and while he was away he did not provide any\n\nmaintenance for the family, and only made good the arrears of maintenance later when he\n\nwas compelled to do so. He acted irresponsibly and appeared to have no concern or care for\n\nhis family. The respondent also kept for himself some matrimonial assets, such as the\n\nproceeds from the sale of the assets of the garment business and his own CPF account.\n\nThese and other assets of his should also be taken into account in the division of the\n\nmatrimonial assets.</p>\n\n</font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\" size=\"4\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\"/></font><font face=\"CG Times (W1),Times New Roman\">25.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result, at the conclusion of the appeal we had no hesitation in\n\nawarding the entire apartment to the appellant and directing the respondent to repay his\n\nown CPF account, if required, with his own funds. That, in our judgment, was a just and\n\nequitable division of the matrimonial asset between them.</font>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Sgd:</p>\n\n<p>YONG PUNG HOW<br/>\n\nChief Justice</p>\n\n<p>Sgd:</p>\n\n<p>L P THEAN<br/>\n\nJudge of Appeal</p>\n\n<p>Sgd: </p>\n\n<p>CHAO HICK TIN<br/>\n\nJudge of Appeal</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

At the conclusion of the hearing, we allowed the appeal and ordered the Committal Order to be set aside on the ground that it was predicated upon the breach of a court order which did not specify a time for compliance. We now give the full reasons for our decision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The facts</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometime in early 2004, the respondent in this appeal commenced divorce proceedings against his wife, the appellant. A decree <i>nisi</i> was granted in July 2004. On 24\u00a0January 2005, the respondent obtained an ancillary order of court (\u201cthe Ancillary Order\u201d) which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The [respondent] be granted sole custody, care and control of the child of the marriage \u2026 and the [appellant] to surrender the child\u2019s passport and birth certificate to the [respondent]. The [appellant] shall be at liberty to apply for access.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant came to know about the Ancillary Order in August 2005 and applied to set it aside. Prior to that, in June 2005, the respondent had applied, via Originating Summons Family No\u00a098 of 2005 (\u201cOSF\u00a098/05\u201d), for an order that the appellant return the child to his lawful custody, care and control pursuant to the Ancillary Order. At the hearing of OSF\u00a098/05 on 22\u00a0August 2005, District Judge\u00a0Shobha Nair adjourned the application pending the outcome of the appellant\u2019s application to set aside the Ancillary Order (\u201cthe setting-aside application\u201d), and also ordered that the status quo be preserved in the interim, subject to the appellant giving the respondent daily access to the child.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometime in March 2006, District Judge\u00a0Nair clarified that her earlier order of 22\u00a0August 2005 was to continue only until the outcome of the setting-aside application and not until the next hearing of OSF\u00a098/05. On 7\u00a0March 2006, the setting-aside application was dismissed by District Judge\u00a0Carol Ling. The appellant appealed against District Judge\u00a0Ling\u2019s decision to the High Court, which dismissed her appeal on 26\u00a0April 2006.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even after the High Court had dismissed her appeal, the appellant did not comply with the Ancillary Order. On 28\u00a0April 2006, the respondent applied for leave to commit the appellant for breach of the Ancillary Order. Leave was granted. Prior to the hearing of the committal application, the appellant handed the child\u2019s passport to her solicitors on 5\u00a0May 2006 to hold as stakeholders. She also handed custody of the child to the respondent on 10\u00a0May 2006, but continued to retain the child\u2019s birth certificate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The decisions below</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The committal application was heard on 16\u00a0May 2006 by the same district judge who made the Ancillary Order (\u201cthe District Judge\u201d). The District Judge held that the appellant had committed contempt of court in refusing to obey the said order. She fined the appellant $1,000 and ordered her to pay the respondent costs fixed at $1,500.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant appealed to the High Court. The Judge dismissed her appeal for the reasons set out below (see the GD at [23]\u2013[24]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I do not accept the wife\u2019s [<i>ie</i>, the appellant\u2019s] submissions relating to the absence of a time frame within which she was required by the [Ancillary Order] to comply with its terms. An order of court takes effect from the date it is pronounced unless the court specifies otherwise in the said order or decides subsequently to stay the same. Although O\u00a042 r\u00a06(1) of the Rules of Court states that a judgment or order which requires a person to do an act must specify the time after service of the judgment or order, or some other time, within which the act is to be done, that is subject to O\u00a042 r\u00a06(2) which exempts orders requiring payment of money, giving of possession of immovable property or delivery of movable property. The handing over of the child\u2019s passport and birth certificate would fall within the last category of exempted orders and, by logical extension, so could [the handing over of custody of] the child himself. Even if the child was excluded from the exemptions, there was still no excuse for not handing over the documents timeously.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Order\u00a045 r\u00a05 of the Rules of Court does not mean that where a judgment or order did not specify a time frame, contempt proceedings could never be taken out. In such a situation, it behoves the applicant in contempt proceedings to prove that a reasonable time for compliance had elapsed. Similarly, s\u00a052 of the Interpretation Act (Cap\u00a01, 2002\u00a0Rev Ed), which relates to the construction and interpretation of written law, states:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where no time is prescribed or allowed within which anything shall be done, that thing shall be done <i>with all convenient speed</i> and as often as the prescribed occasion arises. [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Alternatively, the applicant can apply under O\u00a045 r\u00a06(2) for the court to fix a time within which an act is to be done, but that is really quite unnecessary here because compliance required no more than bringing the child and the documents to the husband [<i>ie</i>, the respondent] or asking him to go to [the appellant\u2019s] home to pick [the child] up together with the documents in issue. That could have been done on the day that [the High Court] dismissed the wife\u2019s appeal [against District Judge\u00a0Ling\u2019s decision] if the wife had genuine regard for all orders of court and not just those in her favour. If the wife\u2019s submissions were correct, it would mean that she could ignore with impunity the [Ancillary Order] until the husband took the further step of applying for a time frame for compliance. In my view, that cannot be correct.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-heading-1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The parties\u2019 contentions on appeal</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant\u2019s main argument was that O\u00a045 r\u00a05(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2006\u00a0Rev Ed) clearly stated that committal proceedings for disobeying a judgment or order could only be commenced, with the leave of the court, where the judgment or order had specified a time within which it had to be complied with.

Normally such positive orders will specify a time within which an act must be done, and indeed the courts are obliged to specify a time under Ord\u00a042, r\u00a02(1). However, by Ord\u00a042, r\u00a02(2), no time limit need be specified in respect of an order or judgment requiring a person to pay money to some other person, or to give possession of any land or to deliver goods. In practice such orders will not normally specify any time limit and accordingly they cannot be enforced by sequestration or committal. However, where the original order does not specify a time limit (and this includes not only orders or judgments requiring persons to pay money to some other person, etc under Ord\u00a042, r\u00a02(2), but also other orders which either through inadvertence or omission have not complied with Ord\u00a042, r\u00a02(1)), the courts are empowered to make a further order requiring the act to be done within a stated time. This subsequent order can be enforced by sequestration or committal, and accordingly where it is thought necessary so to enforce orders for giving possession of land or for the delivery of goods, the procedure to adopt is to apply for this subsequent order.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A similar approach was taken in <i>Kumari v Jalal</i> [1997] 1\u00a0WLR 97, where the Court of Appeal in England said (at 101):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Where there is a dispute about property, a court can decide the question of title and can make an order for delivery up of the property.

But, if it is intended that the order is to be enforced by an order for committal, then it is plain from R.S.C., Ord.\u00a045, r.\u00a05(1) which is substantially the same as C.C.R.

However, in our view, the answer seems obvious as a matter of law and justice in the context of the power to punish a person for contempt of court by imprisonment or imposition of a penalty. It is contrary to all notions of justice that a person could or should be punished for omitting to do an act stipulated in a court order when he does not know or is not certain when such omission constitutes a breach of the court order. In the present case, it is true that the appellant had plenty of time to deliver the child\u2019s birth certificate to the respondent, but, in our view, the meaning of O\u00a045 r\u00a05(1)(<i>a</i>) should not be determined on the facts of a specific case. That rule is explicit in its prescription that a court order requiring a person to do an act <i>must</i> specify a time frame for doing that act before the party subject to the court order can be committed for breaching it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are aware that in <i>Allport Alfred James v Wong Soon Lan</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 385</nobr>, the Court of Appeal held that O\u00a045 r\u00a07(4) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (the equivalent of the present O\u00a045 r\u00a07(4) of the Rules of Court) need not be complied with before a person subject to a court order to abstain from doing an act could be committed for breach of such an order. That case concerned the failure to include a penal notice in an interim injunction restraining the wife in a divorce petition from disposing of the net proceeds of sale of the matrimonial property. The Court of Appeal held that a party breaching such an order could still be committed for contempt so long as he or she had notice of the order.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, in our view, there is a great difference between being required <i>to abstain from doing</i> an act altogether and being required <i>to do</i> an act within a specified time. In the former scenario, time is not critical because the failure to abstain from doing the act at any time is a breach of the order. In the latter scenario, however, the party has not been told by when he must do the act. Imputing a reasonable time to the doing of the act does not help because whether or not there is a breach depends on what the court considers to be reasonable. In short, to commit a person to gaol or to a fine for breaching an order of court that lacks certainty is contrary to our established notions of justice. In <i>Allport Alfred James v Wong Soon Lan</i> <nobr>[1988] SLR 987</nobr>, Chao Hick Tin\u00a0JC said at 989, [8] that the court\u2019s power to punish a person for civil contempt was quasi-criminal in nature, and where any procedural step for the exercise of that jurisdiction was prescribed, that rule should be scrupulously observed and strictly complied with.

The parties were married in September 1991. On 29\u00a0November 2000, the husband petitioned for divorce on the ground of the wife\u2019s adultery. A <i>decree nisi</i> dissolving the marriage was granted on 20\u00a0March 2001. The parties agreed on other ancillary matters except in respect of the custody of three children: the two oldest are girls, X and Y, born on 5\u00a0January 1995 and 14\u00a0November 1996 respectively; the youngest, a son, C, was born on 6\u00a0May 1998.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, following disclosures made by the wife, and subsequent DNA tests carried out, the district judge found that the husband was not the biological father of X and Y. As a result of this discovery, the two girls suffered an identity crisis and having regard to their views, the district judge ordered that it would be in their interest to be in the custody of their mother, with no access to the father. The district judge gave no access to the father in order to ensure that there would not be any accusation of the sort as alleged by the wife regarding an incident which was said to have happened on 27\u00a0October 2002. As regards the son, the district judge, having noted the close bond between father and son and the express wishes of the son, granted custody of him to the father, with weekend access to the mother. These orders of the district judge were made on 26\u00a0May 2003.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 11\u00a0June 2003, the wife issued a notice of appeal against the orders made by the district judge, particularly in relation to the order granting custody of the son to the husband. However the notice was not served on the husband\u2019s solicitors until 6\u00a0August 2003 when her solicitors faxed a copy of it over to the husband\u2019s solicitors. Objection was immediately taken on this late service, a delay of some 49 days.

In such cases, the interests of the parties themselves are secondary to the interests of the child, and for that reason, I exercised my discretion in granting leave to serve the Notice of Appeal out of time. \u2026 Normally, the delay of more than a fortnight would be considered substantial; but in this case, as the substance of the appeal may affect the welfare of the child, I am of the view that an extension ought to be granted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The judge granted the extension notwithstanding the fact that he came to the view that the lapse by the clerk of the solicitors acting for the wife in failing to serve the notice in time was a \u201cpoor excuse\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Headg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The law</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although in this case the notice of appeal was issued within time and only its service was out of time, it is clear that under the ROC, service of the notice is an essential prerequisite for there to have been an appeal. An application to extend time to serve a notice of appeal filed within time is no different in nature from that to extend time to file a notice of appeal out of time as an appeal would only come into being where the notice is both filed and served. Accordingly, an application for an extension of time to serve a notice of appeal out of time should be treated on the same basis as an application to extend time to file a notice of appeal out of time: see <i>Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd v Vithya Sri Sumathis</i> [1999] 3\u00a0SLR 239 at [26], <i>Nomura Regionalisation Venture Fund Ltd v Ethical Investments Ltd</i> [2000] 4\u00a0SLR 46 (\u201c<i>Nomura</i>\u201d) and <i>Denko-HLB Sdn Bhd v Fagerdala Singapore Pte Ltd</i> [2002] 3\u00a0SLR 357 (\u201c<i>Denko</i>\u201d) at [10].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is settled law, as far as these courts are concerned, that in determining whether an extension of time should be granted to a party to either file or serve a notice of appeal out of time, four factors are to be considered, namely, the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the chances of the appeal succeeding if the time for appealing is extended and the degree of prejudice to the would-be respondent if the application is granted. This is clear from a line of authorities of our courts: <i>Hau Khee Wee v Chua Kian Tong</i> [1986] SLR\u00a0484, <i>Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</i> [1991] SLR\u00a0212 (\u201c<i>Pearson</i>\u201d), <i>Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd v Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd</i> [2001] 4\u00a0SLR 441 (\u201c<i>Aberdeen Asset</i>\u201d) and <i>Nomura</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Headg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Relevant factors</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The delay in the present case was some 49 days. By any standard, this was a very substantial delay. As for the reasons of the delay, all that the solicitors for the wife could say was that it was due to \u201cinadvertence\u201d that the notice was not served. This could hardly be a sufficient reason, otherwise it would mean that oversight <i>simpliciter</i> would be a good ground to obtain an extension of time. The judge below was quite correct to remark that it was a \u201cpoor excuse\u201d. As this court observed in <i>Denko</i>, where the delay was only 14 days (at [18]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As we viewed it, the greatest obstacle in the way of Denko\u2019s application was in relation to the first two factors. Not only was the length of the delay quite substantial (bearing in mind the prescribed period of time within which a party must apply to the judge for further arguments was only seven days), there were no extenuating circumstances offered for the \u201coversight\u201d of the solicitor. Some explanation should have been offered to mitigate or excuse the oversight. If, in every case, \u201coversight\u201d is per se a satisfactory ground, we run the risk of turning the rules prescribing time into dead letters. It would be observed in breach. It would be all too simple for a party to run to a judge to ask for indulgence because of oversight. The need for finality must be borne in mind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should add that the delay in serving the notice was not the only instance of delay on the part of the wife. Even after the husband\u2019s solicitors had pointed out that the service effected on 6\u00a0August 2003 was out of time, the wife took her time to apply for an extension of time to serve the notice. It was only done some 23 days later. The wife furthermore took another 12 days to serve the application to extend time on the husband\u2019s solicitors. The wife or her solicitors did not seem to appreciate that compliance with timelines was very important.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning to the other two factors, namely, the merits of the case and the question of prejudice, they were, in the present circumstances, really factors which did not lend much weight in favour of the wife. These were really qualifying factors, the fulfilment of which were essential to enable the court to exercise its discretion. The threshold to satisfy the merit criterion is a relatively low one, <i>ie</i>, the appeal must not be hopeless. Here, we would observe that the district judge, in granting custody of C to the husband, also took into account two FAMCARE reports which strongly recommended that custody of C be given to the father as they shared a strong bond. Still, we could not say that the appeal, if permitted to proceed, would be hopeless. As regards the factor of prejudice, this court had in <i>Aberdeen Asset</i> explained it thus (at [44]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The \u201cprejudice\u201d cannot possibly refer to the fact that the appeal would thereby be continued, if the extension is granted. Otherwise, it would mean that in every case where the court considers the question of an extension of time to file notice of appeal, there is prejudice. We endorse the views expressed in this regard by Woo Bih Li\u00a0JC in <i>S3 Building Services v Sky Technology</i> [[2001] SGHC\u00a087]. The \u201cprejudice\u201d here must refer to some other factors, eg, change of position on the part of the respondent pursuant to judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We recognised that because no notice of appeal was served by 18\u00a0June 2003, the husband, as well as the son, were entitled to conduct their lives as though the wife had accepted the order on the custody of the son. By extending time and allowing the proposed appeal to proceed, the husband would run the risk of the first order being overturned and their lives being upset. In the meantime, there could also be emotional turmoil. But we do not think this could be the meaning of prejudice. Some form of irreversible or permanent change of position must have taken place to constitute prejudice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On weighing the four factors as a whole, there was, in our opinion, hardly any sufficient basis for the court to exercise its discretion to extend time to enable the wife to serve the notice out of time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this juncture we have to allude to one other matter, <i>ie</i>, that the husband has, in fact, appealed against the district judge\u2019s order to the High Court. He is dissatisfied on two counts. First, custody of the two daughters is given to the wife, with no access to him. Second, the access given to the wife in respect of the son is too much. We do not think the fact that the husband\u2019s appeal is still pending should in any way alter the principles which the court should apply to determine whether an extension of time should be granted to the wife in this instance. Moreover, the husband\u2019s appeal, as far as the son is concerned, is of a limited nature, it being confined to the extent of access.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As mentioned before, the only reason the judge below granted an extension of time to the wife to serve the notice of appeal out of time was because he felt that the subject matter in dispute concerned the question of the custody of a child and the paramount consideration was the welfare of the child while the interests of the parties, the parents, were secondary. In other words, he seemed to be suggesting that there should be a more relaxed rule governing extension of time to file or serve a notice of appeal where the matter involved the custody of a child or children.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Headg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Is there a special rule?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It would appear that this is the first time that such a proposition was advocated. Order\u00a03 r\u00a04 of the ROC accords a discretionary power to the court to extend the time within which a person is required by the ROC to do any act in any proceedings. The ROC do not make any differentiation, based on the nature of the proceedings, as to how this discretionary power to extend time is to be exercised.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In <i>Vettath v Vettath</i> [1992] 1\u00a0SLR 1 (\u201c<i>Vettath</i>\u201d), the court was faced with an application to extend time to file and serve a notice of appeal against orders of the High Court relating to ancillary matters in a divorce proceeding, including orders as to the custody and access to the child. This court applied the four-factor test enumerated in Pearson and held that there was insufficient ground for the court to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant. There was nothing in <i>Vettath</i> to suggest that where an appeal related to a custody order, a more liberal regime would apply to enable the dissatisfied spouse to appeal against the orders out of time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Pearson</i> was also a case concerning an appeal out of time against certain ancillary orders, but not relating to the custody of a child.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We appreciate that in <i>Pearson</i> and <i>Vettath</i> the court in each case was not specifically asked to address the issue of whether in respect of custody matters the court should be more enlightened towards granting extension of time to enable an appeal being brought out of time. However, we cannot see any reason or logic why the ordinary principles, as to how the court should exercise its discretion to extend time enumerated in [10] above, should not apply to a case just because the subject matter relates to the custody of a child. It is true that under s\u00a0125 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997\u00a0Rev Ed), as well as s\u00a03 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap\u00a0122, 1985\u00a0Rev Ed), in determining to whom custody of a child should be awarded, the court must bear in mind that the paramount consideration is always the welfare of the child. The court below, (in the present case, the district judge) had applied that principle when it made the order giving custody of the son to the husband. The fact that the wife was unhappy did not mean that there was necessarily any non-observance of that principle by the district judge. Indeed, the district judge expressly stated that in coming to her conclusion she had considered the welfare of the children as paramount. As the High Court judge rightly pointed out, the interests of the parents were secondary.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, the law allows an appeal from such an order and, indeed, from any other order. But to exercise this right of appeal, the party appealing must comply with the rules. In custody proceedings relating to children, it is no less important that the matter in dispute should be brought to an end as soon as possible. A child should be allowed to get on with his life with the parent to whom the court below has awarded custody. Uncertainty will not be in the interest of the child. A more liberal rule to extend time to enable a parent to file or serve a notice of appeal out of time against a custody order would not only undermine the timelines set by the ROC but would also be incompatible with the child\u2019s welfare as it would be unsettling. As far as possible, the court should ensure that there is stability in a child\u2019s life even in the situation of a broken home. Here, we should add that as regards the husband\u2019s appeal, his complaint, as far as the son is concerned, is a limited one, <i>ie</i>, that the access granted to the wife is too much.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is trite law that when a judge exercises his discretion in a matter such as this, namely, the grant or refusal of an extension of time to file or serve a notice of appeal out of time, the appellate court should not substitute its own decision for that of the judge below unless it is shown that the judge had applied the wrong principle, or that he had taken into account matters which he ought not to have done, or failed to take into account matters which he ought to have done, or that the decision is plainly wrong: <i>The Vishva Apurva</i> [1992] 2\u00a0SLR 175.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the light of what has been discussed above, we were satisfied that the judge below had erred on a matter of principle. Thus, we allowed the appeal of the husband and held that no extension of time should be granted to the wife to enable her to serve the notice of appeal out of time.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\7\\7\\URJ_[2001]_SGCA_23_v1.0.html\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"4225\" id=\"4225-M\" uniqueid=\"995e6a21-9c37-426f-97da-480c3af6a61d\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/4225-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2003-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2001-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2001</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>23</No>\n      <NCit>[2001] SGCA 23</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>23</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2001] SGCA 23</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>Official Assignee of the estate of Tang Hsiu Lan, A Bankrupt v Pua Ai Seok and Others</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Official Assignee of the estate of Tang Hsiu Lan, A Bankrupt v Pua Ai Seok and Others</SortTitle><SortDate>2001-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA  72/2000</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#3\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Appellant</Role>\n        <Name>Official Assignee of the estate of Tang Hsiu Lan, A Bankrupt</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#6\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Respondent</Role>\n        <Name>Pua Ai Seok</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#7\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third Party</Role>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#499\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Tan Lee Meng J</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#539\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L P Thean JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#627\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Yong Pung How CJ</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>James Ponniah (instructed) and Tan Lu Seng (Tan Lu Seng &amp; Co) for the appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Tan Soo Kiang and Simon Jones (Wee Swee Teow &amp; Co) for the first, second and third respondents</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Anamah Tan and Sarjeet Singh (Ann Tan &amp; Associates) for the fourth respondent</Counsel>\n    </Counsels>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2024\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Equity</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2034\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Estoppel</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Whether issue estoppel applicable</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Whether same issue re-opened?</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n  \n\n<SLR>YES</SLR></Metadata>\n</CaseReport>\n<body>\n    <p>(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): In this case, the appellant, the official assignee of the estate of Madam Tang Hsiu Lan, a bankrupt, claimed that Madam Tang had a share in No 23 Margoliouth Road, Singapore, which is registered in the names of the first, second and third respondents. The appellant sought, among other things, an order that the said property be sold in the open market and that Madam Tang be paid the amount due to her after the sale of the said property. The trial judge refused to make the orders  requested. We dismissed the appeal against his judgment and now set out the reasons for our decision.<br/><br/><strong><i> Background </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The first respondent, Madam Pua Ai Seok, is the mother of the second, third and fourth respondents. The second respondent, Mr Lee Siong, and the third respondent, Mr Lee Boon, are the younger brothers of the fourth respondent, Mr Lee Ee, who is Madam Tang`s former husband.<br/><br/>Madam Tang, who is from Taiwan, married Mr Lee Ee in 1983. After their marriage, Madam Tang and Mr Lee Ee lived at No 505, Dunman Road, Singapore, together with Mr Lee Ee`s parents and his two brothers. In 1987, Madam Pua and her husband purchased a detached house at No 23, Margoliouth Road (hereinafter referred to as `the Margoliouth property`). The said property was registered in the names of Madam Pua, her husband and their three sons, Mr Lee Siong, Mr Lee Boon and Mr Lee Ee, as joint tenants. At that time, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon were still students.<br/><br/>After the purchase of the Margoliouth property, Madam Tang lived there with Mr Lee Ee, his parents and his two brothers. It was not disputed that the said property was her matrimonial home.<br/><br/>In 1992, Mr Lee Ee transferred his one-fifth share in the Margoliouth property to Madam Pua, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon as joint tenants without any consideration being furnished by them. At the same time, he also transferred his share in the family business to his father, without any consideration.<br/><br/>By 1995, Madam Tang`s marriage to Mr Lee Ee had broken down. In 1996, they were divorced. Justice Sinnathuray, who dealt with the division of matrimonial property, divided the property on the basis that Mr Lee Ee still had a 20% share in the Margoliouth property. As such, he made the following order:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[Madam Tang] be given 40% of the one-fifth share of [the fourth respondent] in the property known as 23 Margoliouth Road, Singapore, that is, the sum of $760,000 and [the fourth respondent] to make payment to [Madam Tang] by 1 May 1997.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The $760,000 referred to in Justice Sinnathuray`s order was calculated on the basis that the Margoliouth property was worth $9.5m. Mr Lee Ee`s 20% share of this amount was $1.9m and Madam Tang`s 40% share of Mr Lee Ee`s share was $760,000.<br/><br/>Mr Lee Ee appealed against the ancillary orders, including the order for the division of matrimonial property. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and allowed him to pay the sum of $760,000 to Madam Tang in two instalments.<br/><br/>Mr Lee Ee failed to pay Madam Tang the amount due to her. In view of this, she obtained a writ of seizure and sale of one-fifth of the Margoliouth property on 23 December 1998.<br/><br/>On 6 January 1999, Madam Pua`s husband died. As a result, she and her two younger sons, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon, were the owners of the Margoliouth property by way of survivorship.<br/><br/>On 3 February 1999, the Registry of Land Titles informed Madam Pua, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon that a writ of seizure and sale had been registered by Madam Tang against the Margoliouth property.<br/><br/><strong><i> SIC No 3391 of 1999 and OS No 841 of 1999 </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In May 1999, Madam Tang filed SIC 3391/99 for the purpose of enforcing the writ of seizure and sale. She sought an order permitting her to sell the Margoliouth property by private treaty or public auction or an order that her beneficial interest in the said property be sold to Madam Pua, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon for $760,000.<br/><br/>On 1 June 1999, Madam Pua, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon filed OS 841/99, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that Madam Tang had no claim or interest in the Margoliouth property.<br/><br/>Although OS 841/99 involved a dispute between Madam Tang and Madam Pua, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon while SIC 3391/99 involved a dispute between Madam Tang and Mr Lee Ee, Chao Hick Tin J, as he then was, heard OS 841/99 together with SIC 3391/99 as they both concerned Madam Tang`s claim that she had a share in the Margoliouth property. He then made the following order on 23 July 1999:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(1) On the basis of the Order of the High Court dated 31 January 1997 in Divorce Petition No 2385 of 1995 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 30 of 1997 dated 26 September 1997, [Madam Tang] has no claim or interest in the [property] which is registered in the name of the [first, second and third respondents].  </p>\n        <p>(2) The application for registration of the Order of Court Instrument I/51426M registered by [Madam Tang] against the said property be cancelled or removed from the land register and that the Registrar of Titles be directed to register the Order made herein against the said property.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> Madam Tang`s new action - OS 423/2000 </i>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Madam Tang did not appeal against Justice Chao`s order. Instead, on 20 March 2000, she filed OS 423/2000, the subject of the present appeal.<br/><br/>In this new action, she sought, inter alia, a declaration to the effect that Madam Pua, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon, as registered proprietors of the Margoliouth property, are `constructive trustees accountable to her for 40% of one-fifth share in the said property`. She also applied for an order for the valuation and sale of the property and for 8% of the gross proceeds of the sale to be paid to her.<br/><br/>The trial judge, Justice Lai Kew Chai, made a number of findings in relation to whether or not there was a trust and on the nature of the trust created. What is relevant for the purpose of the present appeal is that although he agreed that a resulting trust had been created, he dismissed Madam Tang`s application on the ground that the same issues had arisen, or arguably might have arisen, in the earlier proceedings before Chao J. He summed up the position as follows in para 18 of his judgment:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The Order made by Chao Hick Tin J stated that it was made on the basis of the decision of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. If that be the correct interpretation, and that therefore the learned Judge made no pronouncement about the interest of the 4th defendant under the doctrine of resulting trust, it was clear that that particular point was raised and, in any case, it was clear that that particular point might have been raised but was not raised.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <strong>\n        <i> The present appeal </i>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In the appeal before us, the appellant`s counsel said that the relevant issues were as follows:   </p>\n    <p>(i) The scope and effect of an order made pursuant to the powers of the court under s 106 of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Ed) on matrimonial property of an equitable nature, legal title to which was transferred by one spouse to other parties during the marriage. </p>\n    <p>(ii) The circumstances in which the extended doctrine of res judicata can be applied to oust a spouse from enforcing vested proprietary rights against third parties. </p>\n    <p>(iii) The circumstances under which relief by way of a declaration to impose a constructive trust on third parties may be sought to enforce proprietary rights vested by virtue of s 106 of the Women`s Charter.<br/><br/>We do not agree that the relevant issues in this appeal are those stated by the appellant`s counsel for the simple reason that this is a case in which the question of issue estoppel clearly arises.<br/><br/>The rule of issue estoppel was explained in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1991] 2 AC 93</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1991] 3 All ER 41</font> at 47 by Lord Keith in the following terms:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Issue estoppel may arise where a particular issue forming a necessary ingredient in a cause of action has been litigated and decided and in subsequent proceedings between the same parties involving a different cause of action to which the same issue is relevant one of the parties seeks to re-open that issue ... The name `issue estoppel` was first attributed to it by Higgins J in the High Court of Australia in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hoysted v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1921] 29 CLR 537</font>. It was adopted by Diplock LJ in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Thoday v Thoday</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1964]  P 181</font>. Having described cause of action estoppel as one form of estoppel per rem judicatam, he said, at p 198:</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>`The second species, which I will call \"issue estoppel\", is an extension of the same rule of public policy. There are many causes of action which can only be established by proving that two or more different conditions are fulfilled. Such causes of action involve as many separate issues between the parties as there are conditions to be fulfilled by the plaintiff in order to establish his cause of action; and there may be cases where the fulfilment of an identical condition is a requirement common to two or more different causes of action. If in litigation upon one such cause of action any of such separate issues as to whether a particular condition has been fulfilled is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, either upon evidence or upon admission by a party to the litigation, neither party can, in subsequent litigation between one another upon any cause of action which depends upon the fulfilment of the identical condition, assert that the condition was fulfilled if the court has in the first litigation determined that it was not, or deny that it was fulfilled if the court in the first litigation determined that it was.`</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Issue estoppel may arise where a particular issue forming a necessary ingredient in a cause of action has been litigated and decided and in subsequent proceedings between the same parties involving a different cause of action, to which the same issue is relevant, one of the parties seeks to re-open that issue.<br/><br/>For the purpose of applying the rule of issue estoppel, certain conditions must be satisfied. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Sennar</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1985] 2 All ER 104</font> at 110, Lord Brandon stated the position as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[I]n order to create [an issue estoppel], three requirements have to be satisfied. The first requirement is that the judgment in the earlier action relied on as creating an estoppel must be (a) of a court of competent jurisdiction, (b) final and conclusive and (c) on the merits. The second requirement is that the parties (or privies) in the earlier action relied on as creating an estoppel and those in the later action in which that estoppel is raised as a bar must be the same. The third requirement is that the issue in the later action in which the estoppel is raised as a bar must be the same issue as that decided by the judgment in the earlier action.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The requirements of issue estoppel were clearly fulfilled in the present case. In OS 841/99 and in SIC 3391/99, which were heard together by Justice Chao, all the parties to the present proceedings had the opportunity to present their arguments in relation to whether or not there is a trust in relation to Mr Lee Ee`s share of the Margoliouth property and whether or not Madam Tang had a share in the Margoliouth property. As has been mentioned earlier, although OS 841/99 involved a dispute between Madam Tang and Madam Pua, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon while SIC 3391/99 involved a dispute between Madam Tang and Mr Lee Ee, Justice Chao heard OS 841/99 together with SIC 3391/99 as they both concerned Madam Tang`s claim that she had a share in the Margoliouth property.<br/><br/>Evidence of the fact that whether or not there is a trust in relation to Mr Lee Ee`s share of the Margoliouth property has been previously argued may be found in Madam Tang`s counsel`s written submissions in SIC 3391/99. The arguments therein were advanced at the hearing where both this SIC and OS 841/99 were heard together. In the said submissions, her counsel noted that one of the questions before the court was the following:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Whether the High Court and the Court of Appeal made an order that [the deceased] and [the first, second and third respondents] were holding the [20%] share in the property \"<strong> in trust</strong>\" for the [fourth respondent]. [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In the said written submissions, Madam Tang`s position with respect to the question posed above was phrased in the following terms:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[Tang`s] submission is that the issue of whether the High Court and the Court of Appeal had decided whether there was a \"trust\" is merely pedantic. The courts had ruled that [Tang] is entitled to 40% of the [fourth respondent`s 20%] share in absolute terms. However, for the sake of pedantry, it can be inferred by operation of law that the interest of [the fourth respondent] and [Tang] in [the property] are <strong> beneficial in nature</strong>. [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It is also pertinent to note that when Madam Tang`s solicitors, Messrs Tan Lu Seng &amp; Co, wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court on 29 July 1999 to request Justice Chao to hear further arguments, they stated as follows:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[Madam Tang] cited the authority of  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hussey v Palmer</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1972] 3 All ER 744</font> at 757 stating as: [A] constructive trust is a trust imposed by law whenever justice and good conscience require it, wherever the defendant cannot conscientiously keep the property for himself alone but ought to allow another to have the property or a share in it.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It is therefore [Madam Tang`s] humble submission that the very foundation upon which both the High Court [and ... the Court of Appeal] ruled that the [fourth respondent] had a [20% share] in [the property] was on the recognition that <strong> there was an implied or resulting or constructive trust or even secret trust</strong> ...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>[Madam Tang] respectfully submits that the High Court (as affirmed by the Court of Appeal) even if it had ordered monetary compensation of $760,000.00 is not in any way constrained from making a further order that [the property] be sold on the basis that it is just and expedient to do so as the [fourth respondent`s] interest is traceable to [the property] on the principle enunciated in <strong> Hussey v Palmer</strong> which has been adopted by the courts. [Madam Tang] respectfully submits that justice and equity would be defeated if the court now does not exercise its inherent discretionary powers of ordering the sale of the property merely because it had ordered a monetary sum of $760,000.00 to [Madam Tang]. [Emphasis is added.]</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Justice Chao heard further arguments by counsel but he did not change his view that Madam Tang had no claim to or interest in the Margoliouth property. As there has been a determination of the issue before us in a previous hearing, at which all the parties in the present action were represented, the rule of issue estoppel was applicable. Having not appealed against Justice Chao`s order, Madam Tang is in no position to assert before us that Madam Pua, Mr Lee Siong and Mr Lee Boon are accountable to her for `40% of one-fifth share in the said property`. In the circumstances, the appellant`s appeal was dismissed with costs.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n    <p>Appeal dismissed.<br/><br/></p>\n  </body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Having heard counsel for the appellant, we dismissed the\n\nappeal. We now give our reasons.\n\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Z, the person who killed Annie, was jointly tried with Anthony. He\n\nwas convicted of the offence of murder of Annie, but in view of his age (15 only) at the\n\ntime the offence was committed, he was sentenced to be detained at the pleasure of the\n\nPresident. Z, having reconsidered his appeal, withdrew it on the day of the hearing before\n\nus.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><br/>\n\nThe evidence for the prosecution </strong></p>\n\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the material times, Anthony and Annie were husband and wife,\n\nbut were by then separated for almost a year and a half. Divorce proceedings were\n\nimminent. They had a daughter, now aged 4. Annie and her daughter were then living with\n\nAnnie\u2019s parents and her brother at #04-52 Block 923, Hougang Avenue 9, Singapore.</p>\n\n<p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annie was a full-time insurance agent with AIA. On 14 May 2001,\n\nshe returned home from office at about 11.00 pm. Her mother and brother were at home.\n\nAfter her shower, she received a call in her bedroom. She then left the flat in her night\n\ndress, having informed her mother that she was going downstairs to sign some documents\n\nbrought by Anthony. Annie\u2019s daughter went down with her. As neither she nor Anthony\n\nbrought a pen, she took the documents and went up in the lift, intending to sign the\n\ndocuments at the flat and then bringing them down. She left her daughter with Anthony. On\n\nthe fourth floor, as she emerged from the lift and walked towards her mother\u2019s flat,\n\nZ attacked her from the rear, slashing her neck and stabbing her at the chest. Thereafter\n\nhe fled. Her screams were heard by her mother who did not know then that they were from\n\nher daughter. Her mother opened the door to take a look. At that point, Annie managed to\n\nstruggle back to the flat and before she collapsed onto her mother, she told her in\n\nCantonese that she had been stabbed.</p>\n\n<p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The screams of Annie were also heard by Anthony who rushed up with\n\nthe daughter to the flat. He appeared shocked when he saw Annie\u2019s condition. Soon the\n\nambulance arrived and Annie was brought to Tan Tock Seng hospital accompanied by Anthony.\n\nSeveral hours later, Annie succumbed to her injuries. The cause of death was established\n\nby the Forensic Pathologist to be \"acute haemorrhage due to stab wounds of heart and\n\nlung.\"</p>\n\n<p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Police soon arrived at the scene to investigate. They could\n\nnot find the weapon even after extensive search of the block and the surrounding areas.\n\nHowever, at the third floor lift landing they found a piece of newspaper folded in a\n\nrectangular shape. It was the front and back pages of <i>The New Paper</i> of 23 April\n\n2000, with a tear at the front page and this was later established to be a page taken from\n\nAnthony\u2019s home.</p>\n\n<p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 16 May 2001 a search was carried out by the Police at\n\nAnthony\u2019s HDB maisonette at Pasir Ris. In the living room there was a stack of <i>The\n\nNew Paper</i> on a table and on top of the pile was the 23 April 2001 issue with the\n\nfollowing pages 5-34 and 39-44. Also on the table was a crushed sheet of the same issue\n\nconsisting of pp 3-4 and 45-46. The other pages 35-38 of the same issue were found in a\n\nfile containing cuttings on horse racing. So what were missing from that issue of <i>The\n\nNew Paper</i> were the front and back pages. An analyst at the Centre for Forensic\n\nScience, Health Sciences Authority, having examined the piece of <i>The New Paper</i> of\n\n23 April 2001 found on the third floor and the sheets of the same issue found in\n\nAnthony\u2019s home, came to the conclusion that they were from a complete set of the\n\nnewspaper of 48 pages as the manufacturing cutting edges of the sheets fit perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because Anthony told the Police that on 13 May 2001 he was with\n\ntwo of his friends, Gavin Ng and Z, the latter were interviewed by the Police. At an\n\ninterview on 18 May 2001, Z admitted to being the assailant but said that he killed Annie\n\nat the instigation of Anthony. Among the things the Police seized from Z\u2019s home that\n\nday was a Japanese knife and a zip-locked bag. The following was Z\u2019s statement\n\nwritten in his own handwriting:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">On the 14<sup>th</sup> May 2001, I left my friend\u2019s house at about\n\n  9 pm. I went home to bathe and went over to Anthony\u2019s house to meet him and we went\n\n  to Hougang Street 91 Block 923. He went to the coffeeshop then he told me to wait for his\n\n  ex-wife under her block. I saw her alight from the taxi but I couldn\u2019t do it because\n\n  I don\u2019t wish to. I called him and he said that he would meet her again under her\n\n  block. He then told me to wait for her at the staircase. He told me to kill her even if\n\n  his ex-wife was with their daughter. But I saw her with her daughter so I didn\u2019t do\n\n  it. Later she went up alone and I took the chance. I slashed the neck and stabbed her,\n\n  then I went down the stairs and took a cab to Pasir Ris beach, there I threw the knife\n\n  into the dustbin and took a slow walk home, thinking of the inhuman deed I have done to an\n\n  innocent women. I went home, took a bath and went down to Macdonald\u2019s to meet my\n\n  friend.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to this statement by Z, Anthony was arrested on the same\n\nday. He denied any involvement in the murder of Annie.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><br/>\n\n<strong>Statement of Z</strong></p>\n\n<p>10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Subsequently, altogether 12 statements were recorded from Z,\n\nincluding the cautioned statement. Statements were also recorded from the other boys. A\n\nsummary of what they said in the statements is hereinafter set out. But in order to\n\nappreciate how Anthony went about plotting the murder, some details would have to be gone\n\ninto.</p>\n\n<p>11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Z first befriended Anthony when he was ten years old. Anthony was\n\nthen staying in a block opposite to his which was Block 109, Pasir Ris Street 11. Later,\n\nAnthony moved to Block 116 which was also in the same vicinity. Z\u2019s friends then were\n\nGavin Ng (Gavin), Kong Ka Cheong (Ka Cheong), Vickneswaran (Vick) and Seah Tze Howe (Tze\n\nHowe). They are hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the boys\". Their usual\n\nhang out was at the McDonald\u2019s restaurant (McDonald\u2019s) at Block 444, Pasir Ris\n\nDrive 6. A few girls (Melissa, Michelle and Joanna) sometimes joined them. Anthony\n\nsocialised with them there. Anthony was a jovial person and the boys enjoyed his company. </p>\n\n<p>12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was at a gathering, during the first week of May 2001, when\n\nthe boys were talking of fighting and killing, that Anthony challenged them if they dared\n\nto kill people. The boys asked if there was any reward. Gavin mentioned $100,000. Anthony\n\nsaid he was willing to pay that amount. When asked who did Anthony want to be killed, he\n\nreplied it was his wife. He said he could offer to pay if he were to sell off his\n\nmaisonette, which had an estimated value of $470,000. While talking, Anthony was smiling\n\nand then said he was only joking. However, he also uttered that he wished his wife was\n\ndead.</p>\n\n<p>13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 9 May 2001 at about 12.30pm, Anthony, Z and Gavin were again\n\nat McDonald\u2019s. Anthony again raised the matter about killing his wife. This time his\n\ntone was serious. He told them that he was a professional killer and had killed five\n\npeople before. Anthony also taught them how to go about doing it \u2013 use a full-face\n\nhelmet, bring a pair of gloves, preferably woollen, and a zip-lock plastic bag to hold the\n\nknife and the victim\u2019s wallet (so as to make it look like a robbery), the route to be\n\nused, how to dispose of the knife, the wallet and clothing, and the identity card of his\n\nwife was to be sent back to her home (same as Anthony\u2019s address as Annie had not yet\n\nchanged her NRIC address) with a note saying \"sorry etc\". As between Z and\n\nGavin, Anthony thought the latter was more stable and daring and thus better able to carry\n\nout the assignment but Z felt hurt and jealous and offered to do it.</p>\n\n<p>14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Z then left, leaving Anthony and Gavin behind. Anthony indicated\n\nto Gavin that he preferred the job be carried out by Gavin. Anthony persistently asked\n\nGavin to kill his wife and the latter said he would think about it. At Anthony\u2019s\n\nsuggestion, Gavin went to Anthony\u2019s home where Anthony showed Gavin how to carry out\n\nthe killing with the use of a knife, either from the front or from the rear of the victim.\n\nGavin left Anthony\u2019s home at about 7.00pm. He did not reply to Anthony whether he was\n\nprepared to do the killing. Later that evening, Gavin spoke over the phone with a female\n\nfriend, Adeline Quek, who strongly advised Gavin against doing it.</p>\n\n<p>15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also that same evening, Z went to Gavin\u2019s home where the\n\nlatter told him that he had informed Adeline Quek of what Anthony wanted them to do and\n\nwhat Adeline\u2019s advice was. Gavin, in turn, advised Z not to do it as \"it was a\n\nset-up.\" Z replied that he had no intention of carrying out Anthony\u2019s plot.</p>\n\n<p>16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After leaving Gavin\u2019s home, Z went over to McDonalds. Gavin\n\ncalled Z on the handphone to ask the latter to inform Anthony that he would not be doing\n\nthe job. After all the other people had left, Z told Anthony of Gavin\u2019s decision\n\nwhereupon Anthony asked Z if he would like to carry it out. Z said anything, indicating a\n\nkind of willingness.</p>\n\n<p>17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That same night Z went round his neighbourhood looking for a\n\nhelmet. He found one with a jacket inside on a motorcycle and stole them. After that he\n\nwent over to Anthony's home. The two talked the whole night until the morning. In their\n\ndiscussions, they touched on the sort of knife to buy (Anthony showed Z samples from his\n\nown kitchen), small enough to be hidden on the body yet sharp and long enough to reach the\n\nheart, the need to buy a pair of gloves, two pre-paid handphone cards from M1 to\n\nfacilitate untraceable communications between the two and a cloth to wipe the knife after\n\nthe job. Z said that he was ready to carry out the task that night (10 May). </p>\n\n<p>18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The plan was that Z was to bring the things together in a\n\nhaversack, which should also contain a change of clothes. He was to put on a long sleeved\n\nshirt to avoid being scratched and leaving traces of his tissue in the wife\u2019s\n\nfingernails. Anthony also showed Z an album containing photographs of his wife. Z should\n\ncarry out the attack in the lift, if not, after she had stepped out of the lift on the\n\nfourth floor. He should run up the stairs and attack her from the back. He was to avoid\n\nholding any railing so as not to leave any finger-prints. After stabbing Annie, Z was to\n\ntake Annie\u2019s wallet, empty the contents into the zip-lock bag and throw the wallet\n\naway. In this way, the whole thing would look like a robbery. In making his escape he\n\nshould just leave the helmet on any motorcycle he came across. He should take a bus\n\ninstead of a taxi as the latter would be more likely to be stopped at police road blocks.\n\nHe should find his way to the nearest MRT station where he should wash the knife, the\n\ngloves and anything that had blood on it and put the rest into the zip-lock bag. He should\n\nchange his clothes and go as far as possible and throw away the things at different\n\nlocations. As regards the money taken from the wallet, if it be soiled with blood, it\n\nshould be burnt away so as to avoid detection. As for Annie\u2019s identity card it should\n\nbe posted back with a note of apology. Anthony told Z that to make it look real he would\n\ncry at Annie\u2019s wake and that he had acquired the art of doing so. That morning before\n\nZ parted company with Anthony, the former was given $100 by the latter (in two $50 notes)\n\nto buy a knife, zip-lock bag, the M-cards, etc.</p>\n\n<p>19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Later that morning, after taking his examination in school, Z\n\nwent to a handphone shop near to McDonald\u2019s. He gathered from the shop manager that\n\nthe particulars of purchasers of pre-paid phonecards need not be registered. He bought two\n\nphonecards with running numbers (for easy remembering) and went home to sleep until awoken\n\nby Anthony. Z then took the helmet, the M-cards and a paper-bag with a long sleeved\n\nsweater and walked over to Anthony\u2019s home. He reaffirmed his readiness to carry out\n\nthe job that evening. They left Anthony\u2019s maisonette, intending to buy a knife and\n\nthe gloves. Z went alone into a hardware shop and bought a knife with a paper casing.\n\nLater he went back to the same shop to buy a pair of rubber gloves. Earlier, he had wanted\n\nto buy a pair of leather gloves but Anthony told him that any type would do.</p>\n\n<p>20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thereafter, they went by bus to Hougang. They sat together at the\n\nupper deck. Along the journey, Anthony asked Z if the latter was scared. Though nervous, Z\n\nput on a brave front. They then changed to a feeder bus and they sat separately because\n\nAnthony did not want to be seen with Z. At a certain bus stop, Anthony alighted and Z\n\nfollowed suit. Through the use of their handphones (with the M-cards) Anthony communicated\n\nwith Z, telling him that the bus stop was the one at which Annie would usually alight and\n\nthe route he was taking was also her usual route. He asked Z to wait for him on the fifth\n\nfloor of Block 923.</p>\n\n<p>21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Z came out of the lift on the fifth floor, Anthony came from\n\nbehind him and demonstrated to him how to kill Annie: Anthony covered Z\u2019s mouth with\n\nhis left hand and moved a finger across his throat, saying \"See, it\u2019s so\n\nsimple\". Z was told to carry out the attack on Annie one level below, as that was\n\nwhere her parents\u2019 flat was.</p>\n\n<p>22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony also showed Z, by communicating on the handphones, the\n\nlocation of the coffee shop where he would usually meet Annie. They sat separately in the\n\ncoffee shop. Some fifteen to twenty minutes later, Z was asked to go back to Block 923 to\n\nwait for Annie\u2019s return. That evening Annie came home by taxi. As Z had not seen\n\nAnnie before, he called Anthony to verify what she looked like. By the time he ran up to\n\nthe fourth floor, Annie had already returned to her parents\u2019 flat.</p>\n\n<p>23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About half an hour later, Anthony called Annie to come down to\n\nthe coffee shop. At the same time he informed Z to ambush her at the fourth floor. He ran\n\nup from the ground floor and saw Annie holding a little girl by the hand and taking the\n\nlift down. He then ran down the stairs and caught up with them. However, he did not have\n\nthe heart to do the job. He retreated.</p>\n\n<p>24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some time later, as Annie was leaving the coffee shop with the\n\ndaughter, Anthony called Z to inform him that she was returning to the flat and that he\n\nshould carry out the plan on the fourth floor, regardless of the fact that the daughter\n\nwas with Annie. Because he was hesitant, Z took his time and was a little too late when he\n\nreached the fourth floor. Anthony was angry at his failure. Z said they could try again\n\nthe next day.</p>\n\n<p>25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Back at Anthony\u2019s home, Z left the things there and asked\n\nAnthony if he could back out of the whole plot. While saying that he understood, Anthony\n\ninstigated Z by saying it would take a different type of guts to do such things.\n\nThereafter, Z agreed to try again the next day.</p>\n\n<p>26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next day, sometime past 5.00pm, Z came to Anthony\u2019s home\n\nas requested by the latter. Z took out the knife he had bought to show to Anthony. Both\n\nthought it was a little too short. Anthony took a steak knife from his kitchen and gave it\n\nto Z and placed the knife which Z had bought in the tray with other knives of his.</p>\n\n<p>27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Z wanted to place the steak knife under his waist, Anthony\n\nadvised against it lest he cut himself. Instead he took a sheet of newspaper from a pile\n\non a table, folded it and used it to wrap the blade of the steak knife and passed the\n\nknife back to Z. They left Anthony\u2019s home and travelled by bus to Hougang. On this\n\ntrip he advised Z not to use his MRT farecard for fear of being traced. He passed some\n\ncoins to Z for his use. At the bus-interchange they walked apart like the way they did the\n\nday before. Upon reaching their destination, Anthony walked to the coffee shop while Z\n\nwent to the void deck of Block 923.</p>\n\n<p>28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While waiting, Z again had second thoughts and did not want to\n\ncarry out the attack. He even disposed of the helmet by leaving it on a parked motorcycle.\n\nBecause of his reluctance, the planned action again did not materialise, as Z moved too\n\nslowly.</p>\n\n<p>29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On returning to Anthony\u2019s home, and on being asked why he\n\ndid not carry out the job, Z again said he wanted to back out. Anthony dissuaded him by\n\nsaying that the reward of $100,000 was a lot of money which would be of great use to him.\n\nZ seemed to have been persuaded and he left, asking Anthony to call him regarding the next\n\nattempt.</p>\n\n<p>30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 12 May 2001 Anthony called Z to arrange for another attempt to\n\nattack Annie on that evening or the following day. For one reason or another, Z did not\n\nagree with both suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then on 13 May 2001 sometime past midnight, pursuant to\n\narrangements, Anthony met Z at McDonald\u2019s and told him that on the night before, one\n\nSingh (Darshan Singh) challenged him to a fight at McDonald\u2019s. There was some\n\naltercation. Notwithstanding the arrival of the Police, Darshan Singh (Darshan) threatened\n\nto kill Anthony. He told Z that the incident could be used to their advantage so that, if\n\nZ were to attack Annie, the suspicion would fall on Darshan. At this point, Z indicated\n\nthat he did not want to go through with the plan to kill, but Anthony threatened to kill\n\nhim on the ground that the latter already knew too much.</p>\n\n<p>32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next day, 14 May, past 9.00pm, Z arrived at Anthony\u2019s\n\nhome. There, the two of them practised, by the use of a comb as a knife, on how to attack\n\nAnnie from behind, covering her mouth with the left hand and slashing her throat with the\n\nknife in the right hand and then stabbing at her chest. Anthony assured Z that everything\n\nwould turn out fine. Thereafter, they travelled by bus to Hougang and alighted at the\n\nbus-stop where Annie would usually alight. Anthony proceeded to the coffee-shop while Z\n\nwaited at the void deck of Block 923.</p>\n\n<p>33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometime later, Annie came back in a taxi and went straight to\n\nthe lift. Z was again frightened and did not act. Later, Anthony informed Z that Annie\n\nwould be coming down to the void deck to meet him and asked Z to wait between the fourth\n\nand fifth floors and to act when he saw Annie walking towards the lift, regardless of\n\nwhether or not the daughter was with her. Again Z could not make himself do it when Annie\n\nappeared with the daughter. Anthony scolded Z when the latter told him what happened. He\n\nthen instructed Z to wait on the fourth floor and that Annie would be going up alone.</p>\n\n<p>34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As soon as Annie emerged from the lift on the fourth floor, Z\n\ncame behind her, used the cloth to cover her mouth, slashed her neck with the steak knife\n\nand then stabbed her. Annie fell backwards. He wiped the knife with the cloth and put the\n\nknife into his rear trouser pocket and ran down the stairs. He walked briskly to the bus\n\nstop and took a taxi (which happened to arrive first) to Pasir Ris, where he washed the\n\nknife in a toilet and disposed of it in a rubbish bin and went home.</p>\n\n<p>35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next day when Z met Gavin, he told the latter what he had\n\ndone. Gavin was shocked and scolded him for his stupidity. On 17 May 2001, Z went over to\n\nAnthony\u2019s home as instructed by the latter. Anthony was sitting in front of his\n\ncomputer typing out a message asking Z to act shocked when told of Anthony\u2019s\n\nwife\u2019s death and informing him that the Police could hear their conversation. They\n\nthen carried out a short conversation as planned for the benefit of the Police.\n\nThereafter, Anthony reverted to typing and asked \"where is the IC?\" Z asked\n\n\"What IC?\" Anthony responded \"The IC you used to register the card\". Z\n\nsaid \"No need\". Anthony then typed and asked Z what the latter had done with the\n\nknife and the M-card. Z typed in reply that he had broken the card and thrown away the\n\nknife at the beach. Anthony further stated on the computer that, if the Police should find\n\nout about Z\u2019s involvement, the latter should tell them that he did it on his own.\n\nAfter this, they resumed their oral conversation, with Anthony saying he was sad about his\n\nwife\u2019s death. Z then left Anthony\u2019s flat.</p>\n\n<p>36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were three computer systems in Anthony\u2019s home. They\n\nwere examined by Station Inspector Murad bin Abdul Latiff (SI Murad) of the Techno\n\nForensic Branch of the Technology Crime Division, CID. In one of the computers SI Murad\n\nmanaged to retrieve a deleted file dated 17 May 2001 timed at 7.33am where there were the\n\nfollowing expressions/words:-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"They can hear what we are saying.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Act shock that the woman is my wife. When I tell you.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"U threw the knife.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"the chip the ic.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"the 2 ic.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"type to tell me.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"What ic?\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"to buy the chip.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"no need ic.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"I drop my ic.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"police found they might trace to your friend.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"They ask you if I\" loan u on 14.5.01 say yes.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Bthey can trace the call.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Ttook my money.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Your Ypayment might have 2 wait.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Hyou understand.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"If 1police found the chip.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"say wrong number if they question u.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"they ask you 90418565 who is.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"you say male wrong number.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Wthey ask me who is 90418566.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"II say female wrong number.\"</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"ur friend play u out, just deny it\".</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"Ts no way they can catch u.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">He could not find if, inter alia, the phrase \"I was only joking\n\nabout killing my wife\" was in the computers. The words mentioned above which were\n\nretrieved from the computer were not disputed by Anthony.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><br/>\n\nEvidence on motive</strong></p>\n\n<p>37.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecution also relied upon the evidence of a number of\n\nwitnesses to show motive. Tze Howe, aged 22, was first introduced to Anthony by Z in\n\nFebruary 2001. He interacted more closely with Anthony because he was interested in\n\nhorse-racing prediction and Anthony had told him that he was planning to launch a magazine\n\non horse-racing. In relation to Anthony\u2019s plot, Tze Howe recalled having once asked\n\nhim why did he not hire a professional to do the job. In response, Anthony asked Tze Howe\n\nto find one for him and he would give Tze Howe a 20% share in his company. The next day\n\nAnthony called Tze Howe to enquire if he had found anyone. He sounded serious. To put him\n\noff, Tze Howe said a friend was trying to help. In the next two days, Anthony kept\n\ncontacting Tze Howe, on his handphone. Eventually, Tze Howe had to tell Anthony that he\n\ncould not find anyone. He denied the suggestion that it was he who pestered Anthony about\n\nthe $100,000 reward for killing Annie so that he could have the money to invest in\n\nAnthony\u2019s magazine on horse-racing.</p>\n\n<p>38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gavin said that on 9 May 2001, after the meeting at\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, Anthony asked him to go to his home. Among the things shown to Gavin were\n\nalbums containing photographs of his wife and daughter and a kitchen drawer where there\n\nwere a lot of small knives, some of which Anthony indicated could be used to kill his\n\nwife. He also demonstrated to Gavin how the killing could be done. For the demonstration,\n\nAnthony\u2019s bolster was used as if it were Annie.</p>\n\n<p>39.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attempts were made to discredit the evidence of Gavin, that he\n\nhad stabbed someone before and that he had made a girl pregnant. These were denied. Gavin\n\nadmitted that he and Z had discussed with Anthony their personal problems and vice-versa.\n\nAlthough he felt greatly induced by Anthony to carry out the assignment, he did not do it.\n\nHis girlfriend, Adeline Quek, played a part in his determination. He admitted that nothing\n\nhappened to him when he turned Anthony down. Anthony did not utter any threat against him.</p>\n\n<p>40.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two women with whom Anthony had affairs also testified. The first\n\nwas one Berlinda Ho who cohabited with him from 1997 to 2000. They were also involved in\n\nsome business together. He had complained to Berlinda about his wife wanting a divorce and\n\nof his concerns that he could not pay her maintenance and his visitation rights to his\n\ndaughter might be restricted. He even told Berlinda that, if Annie were to take his\n\ndaughter away from him, he would kill Annie. When they broke up and Berlinda left him,\n\nAnthony threatened to kill her but he did not carry out the threat.</p>\n\n<p>41.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After Berlinda left him, Anthony befriended one Marilyn Tan Su\n\nFen. He told her of his plan to publish a magazine on horse-racing and was looking for\n\ninvestors and that this was a quick way of making money. He also told her he was in debt\n\nand was a bankrupt. Nevertheless she was persuaded to invest some $50,000 in the venture,\n\nwhich she registered as a sole proprietorship business under the style of \"Advance\n\nMedia\". When another potential investor backed out from the venture, the business\n\nsuffered, so much so that Marilyn even contemplated committing suicide. When she\n\ncommunicated this desire to Anthony, he told her that before she took her own life, she\n\nshould go and kill his wife first so that he would be able to tell the Police that Marilyn\n\nkilled out of jealousy.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><br/>\n\nDefence</strong></p>\n\n<p>42.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In his evidence, Anthony said he started to mix with Z and his\n\ngroup of friends from around October/November 2000, several times a week between 10.00pm\n\nand 1.00am at the McDonalds\u2019. He had acted as an elder brother in advising and\n\ncounselling them on their problems. On one occasion in mid April 2001 the boys talked of\n\nfights and declared that they were not afraid of killing. He thought they were just\n\nboasting and the topic of killing for payment came up. He challenged them to kill for\n\nreward. When he was asked who he had in mind, he unthinkingly mentioned his wife as an\n\nexample, as she was the only person they knew. Of course, they also knew he and his wife\n\nwere then estranged.</p>\n\n<p>43.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony also confirmed the conversation Tze Howe had with him\n\nregarding engaging a professional to do the killing. The subject came about because Tze\n\nHowe was interested in investing in the horse racing magazine which Anthony was planning\n\nto publish. Tze Howe did not have the money so he thought of the $100,000 reward. So just\n\nto call his bluff, Anthony challenged him to find a killer. Eventually, Tze Howe backed\n\noff.</p>\n\n<p>44.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Anthony\u2019s suggestion to Marilyn that she kill\n\nAnnie, this must be viewed in the context of the circumstances then. At the time, Marilyn\n\nwanted to commit suicide. His intention of mentioning to Marilyn about killing his wife\n\nfirst was to buy time so that he could counsel Marilyn not to do something silly. As\n\nregards what he said to Berlinda, those were said while he was arguing with Berlinda and\n\nin the heat of argument he said he would kill his wife if she took the daughter away from\n\nhim. He did not ask Berlinda to kill Annie.</p>\n\n<p>45.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony admitted that on 9 May 2001 he did discuss with Gavin how\n\nthe latter could go about killing Annie. But it was never his intention to have Gavin kill\n\nAnnie. It was really to call Gavin\u2019s bluff \u2013 to show that it was all nothing\n\nmore than big talk on Gavin\u2019s part. All the details he discussed with Gavin, e.g.,\n\nhow to kill and to send Annie\u2019s identity card back with an apology etc, were to make\n\nit look real so as to see how far Gavin was prepared to go. Anthony said that, while he\n\ndid not think Z had the guts to do it, Z did indicate that he would like to do the job. He\n\nconfirmed that on that day, Gavin came to his home and he taught Gavin how to slash\n\nAnnie\u2019s throat, using a bolster, as a substitute for Annie. He drew a sketch of the\n\nblock, showing the lift lobby together with the corridors and the staircases. Before Gavin\n\nleft Anthony\u2019s home, they agreed to recce Annie\u2019s parents\u2019 home.</p>\n\n<p>46.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That evening, while Anthony was with Z at McDonald\u2019s, Z\n\nreceived an SMS message from Gavin on his handphone asking Z to tell Anthony that Gavin\n\nwas no longer interested in the job (Z\u2019s evidence differed here: it was a phone\n\ncall). Anthony laughed as if to say it proved he was correct after all. He was not angry\n\nwith Gavin for backing out.</p>\n\n<p>47.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony denied ever having brought Z to Hougang to recce Block\n\n923. When he was questioned on how Z came to know of the place of residence of Annie,\n\nAnthony said Z must have followed him to Hougang. He also denied having told Z to kill his\n\nwife or planned with him to kill her. He loved and cared for his daughter very much and\n\nwould never have asked anyone to kill his wife in the presence of his daughter. He also\n\ndenied giving $100 to Z to buy the two M-cards as he himself was so broke that he had to\n\neven borrow $50 from Marilyn.</p>\n\n<p>48.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony said that on 14 May 2001, in the morning, Z came to his\n\nhome to surf the internet. At the time, Anthony was about to leave for Hougang to meet a\n\nbookmaker. Z told him that he wanted to visit his uncle who was living in the vicinity of\n\nAnnie\u2019s residence. But they went their separate ways.</p>\n\n<p>49.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After Annie was killed, Anthony suspected it could be Gavin who\n\ndid it as the latter appeared the most courageous of the boys. So on 17 May 2001 Anthony\n\ncalled Z to tell the latter that he was being watched by the Police. Z came to his home.\n\nAnthony told Z that he suspected it could also be Darshan, with whom he fought, who did\n\nit. But to Anthony\u2019s shock, Z said that he had done it. Thereafter, for fear that his\n\nhome might be bugged, Anthony communicated with Z by typing on the computer. He claimed\n\nthat his aim was to protect Z.</p>\n\n<p>50.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony asserted that Z implicated him in the crime perhaps\n\nbecause Z perceived that Anthony had squealed to the Police and Z was trying to get even.\n\nAs regards the sheet of <i>The New Paper</i>, since Z was free to move around in his\n\nmaisonette, it was probable that Z took a sheet off that issue without his knowledge.\n\nNeither did he give the steak knife to Z who probably swapped it with the knife he bought\n\nfrom the hardware shop.</p>\n\n<p>51.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony admitted having gone to Annie\u2019s home on 11 May 2001\n\nas she called him. He did not bring Z there. He also met Z in the evening of 13 May 2001\n\nand informed the latter of the incident involving Darshan the previous day. He denied\n\ntelling Z that, should Z kill Annie, the Police might well suspect Darshan as the killer.\n\nHe denied having threatened to kill Z if the latter were to refuse to kill Annie. However,\n\nhe admitted to typing the words \"payment might have 2 wait\" because Z was\n\npressing for payment and he was stalling for time.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><br/>\n\nEvidence of Z at trial</strong></p>\n\n<p>52.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In his evidence in court, Z reiterated what he stated in the\n\nnumerous statements - that he killed Annie as plotted by Anthony and that while he felt\n\nhurt that Anthony chose Gavin over him to kill Annie, he would not have killed anyone just\n\nto show he was more mature, if not for the threat of Anthony. He was afraid to tell anyone\n\nof what Anthony wanted him to do. He had never visited his uncle in Hougang before.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><br/>\n\nDecision below</strong></p>\n\n<p>53.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge found that the idea of getting his wife killed\n\nwas hatched in Anthony\u2019s mind. While he initially raised it with the boys in a\n\njocular manner, he was, in fact, dead serious. He discussed with Tze Howe on how to engage\n\na professional killer to do the job and with Gavin and Z on how his wife could be killed,\n\nusing a bolster symbolising his wife. The trial judge debunked Anthony\u2019s assertion\n\nthat he was only testing Gavin with these observations (281):-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"\u2026 when this so-called \u2018joke\u2019 was called off in the\n\n  early hours of Thursday, 10 May 2001, Anthony Ler did not exult in his \u2018victory\u2019\n\n  over Gavin by telling him that he had seen through Gavin\u2019s boasting and proved him to\n\n  be lacking in killer\u2019s guts. He did not even ask to speak to Gavin when the latter\n\n  called Z at McDonald\u2019s that day. Instead, he merely appeared to have been calm in his\n\n  disappointment over Gavin\u2019s withdrwal from the plan. Similarly, when Anthony Ler met\n\n  Gavin two or three days later at McDonald\u2019s, there was no gloating and jibing by\n\n  Anthony Ler over the elaborate con job that he had supposedly pulled on Gavin.\" </p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>54.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge accepted the evidence of Z as entirely truthful.\n\nHe did not think that Z was capable of concocting all those stuff which he told the court,\n\nif they did not, in fact, occur. He did not see in Z a vicious individual who would\n\nunjustifiably implicate another.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><br/>\n\nAppeal</strong></p>\n\n<p>55.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before us, counsel for Anthony rehashed the same main contention\n\nwhich was canvassed in the court below, that he did not intend that Z should, in fact, go\n\nand kill his wife. He had no reason to have her killed, after all they separated amicably.\n\nHe was only playing a game of bluff with the boys, who were boasting of getting involved\n\nin fights and killing. He never intended the boys to take it for real. Counsel suggested\n\nthat because Z was not Anthony\u2019s first choice for the job of potting-off his wife,\n\nhis ego was hurt and to show that he was just as capable and strong in mind as Gavin, Z\n\nwent about entirely on his own. The killing of Annie was purely an egoistic act on the\n\npart of Z, carried out to prove to himself and to Anthony that he was not a weak person.</p>\n\n<p>56.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel also urged us to disregard the evidence which suggested\n\nthat Anthony had also instigated Tze Howe and Gavin to undertake the task of killing his\n\nwife. It was irrelevant to the killing undertaken by Z and, in any case, his instigation\n\nof Tze Howe and Gavin was really, as Anthony said, part of his game of bluff.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><br/>\n\nOur analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>57.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony\u2019s central theme was that it was just a game of bluff\n\nand that Z killed Annie to satisfy his own ego. To show that he had no motive to kill his\n\nwife, he emphasised that they separated amicably. While he loved his daughter, he had no\n\nmeans to take care of her and was thus in no position to fight for custody. </p>\n\n<p>58.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fact of the matter was that Anthony had serious financial\n\ntroubles. Annie was then about to divorce him. He was given limited access to his\n\ndaughter. The extent to which he had gone about the \"game\" defied his assertion\n\nthat there were no problems with Annie.</p>\n\n<p>59.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The whole thing was indeed morbid. Not only did he mention the\n\nidea of getting someone to kill his wife once, he mentioned it numerous times. He\n\nmentioned it to his two ex-lovers, Berlinda and Marilyn. He talked about it to the boys,\n\nfirst as a group, and later individually. Clearly he was very obsessed with the thought of\n\nhaving his wife killed. All these utterances (besides those to Z) clearly evinced his\n\nill-will towards his wife and were undoubtedly relevant to the charge preferred against\n\nhim of instigating a murder. Illustration (p) to s 14 of the Evidence Act is on point\n\n\u2013</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">\"(p) A is tried for a crime.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that\n\n  particular crime is relevant.</p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\">The fact that he said something indicating a general disposition to\n\n  commit crimes of that class is irrelevant.\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>60.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards Anthony\u2019s contention that Z carried out the\n\nkilling because of egoistic motives, in our judgment, nothing could be further from the\n\ntruth. Z was then fifteen years old with an average IQ of 93. There was psychiatric\n\nevidence which showed that Z\u2019s \"mental state was susceptible to a point, that he\n\nliterally had to do what he was told by a skilful and aggressive proselytiser.\"\n\nAnthony was looked up to by the boys, including Z. He admitted as much that he had\n\ninfluence over Z. He made use of this superior position to manipulate and pressurize Z\n\ninto doing his bidding, as he tried without success with Gavin. Z followed Anthony\u2019s\n\ninstructions in buying two M-cards, the knife, gloves, etc. Z followed him to Hougang\n\nwhere he was shown the block where Annie lived and the path she usually took from the\n\nbus-stop to her home.</p>\n\n<p>61.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony knew Z was not a strong-willed person. Thus, he would\n\nhave preferred that Gavin undertook the task. But with Gavin backing out, he had no other\n\nchoice but to accept Z as a fallback. Anthony persisted in wanting Z to do the killing\n\neven though on two occasions (on 10 and 11 May) Z was shown not to have the guts to do it.\n\nSo much so that after the second failed attempt when Z wanted to quit, Anthony preyed on\n\nhis ego by using reverse psychology, saying it was all right and that he understood. After\n\nall, he had previously told Z that the assignment required \"a different kind of\n\nguts.\" He also enticed him with the $100,000 reward stating what the sum of money\n\ncould do for him. He continued to cajole and badger Z and coupled it with a demonstration\n\nof his martial art prowess to suffocate a person or to break an arm. He worked on Z\u2019s\n\nweaknesses. At that point Z was really afraid that if he did not proceed to kill Annie,\n\nAnthony would kill him. As the trial judge quite rightly observed, if it were true that Z\n\nproceeded to kill because of his own ego, he would have bragged about it to Anthony and\n\nhis friends, instead of feeling dejected and afraid after the event.</p>\n\n<p>62.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another aspect of the evidence which again clearly implicated\n\nAnthony was his behaviour after Annie was killed. Why should he have the phobia that the\n\nPolice were bugging his home if he was indeed innocent and that all his instigations were\n\njust jokes? Moreover, why did he start to communicate with Z using the computer? Why did\n\nhe, in reply to Z\u2019s request for money, not state \"what money\" \"it was\n\na joke\" \"you idiot\" or words to that effect but had instead said \"your\n\npayment might have 2 wait\"? In short, he admitted there was the deal for which he had\n\nto pay Z the $100,000. When asked why did he respond in that manner he said \"I\n\ndon\u2019t know why. I just put it that way.\" It was clear to us, as it was to the\n\njudge, that he replied in that manner because that was the truth \u2013 there was a deal.</p>\n\n<p>63.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anthony contended that consideration must be given to the fact\n\nthat his evidence given in court tallied in substance with the numerous statements he gave\n\nto the Police. Such consistency alone did not mean that the court should have accepted his\n\nevidence. Consistency was no doubt a factor in the overall assessment. But the evidence\n\nmust be verified against the objective facts and the evidence of other witnesses. Apart\n\nfrom all previous preparatory acts Anthony had undertaken, including coaching Z on how to\n\ncarry out the killing, what things to get, where Annie lived and how she looked like, one\n\ncrucial fact which implicated Anthony in the plot was Z\u2019s presence on the fourth\n\nfloor waiting for Annie who was coming up to get a pen to sign the documents. In all the\n\ncircumstances, it was a clear case of a plot rather than a coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>64.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the whole thing was intended by him to be a joke why\n\ndidn\u2019t he say so in his cautioned statement? It would have taken him no time to state\n\nthis simple fact. But he did not, giving the excuse that he was tired. His story was\n\nclearly an afterthought, something cooked up by him later.</p>\n\n<p>65.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, it was argued that if Anthony was serious in wanting his\n\nwife killed, he would not have solicited the help of a bunch of 15-16 year old boys, some\n\nof whom he had only recently got acquainted with. We could see that he was a schemer,\n\nalways seeking ways to ensure that no one would link him to the crime, e.g., wanting to\n\nmake the killing look like a robbery; wishing the Police would suspect that the killing\n\nwas done by Darshan in revenge. But the fact of the matter was that he did all this. He\n\nwas desperate and the boys were his only hope.</p>\n\n<p>66.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the premises, we were satisfied that there was solid evidence\n\nto substantiate the charge against Anthony beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we\n\naffirmed the conviction and sentence.</p>\n\n<p>67.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In passing, we would observe that the present case involved a\n\nfinding of fact by the trial court that Anthony did instigate Z into killing Annie. It is\n\ntrite law that an appellate court, which does not have the advantage of hearing the\n\nwitnesses and observing their demeanour, will not disturb a lower court\u2019s findings of\n\nfact unless they are clearly wrong and against the weight of the evidence: see <i>Lim Ah\n\nPoh v PP</i> <a target=\"LWBMainFrame\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6012&amp;freetext=\">[1992] 1 SLR 713</a>.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Sgd:</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">YONG PUNG HOW<br/>\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE</p>\n\n<p>Sgd:</p>\n\n<p>CHAO HICK TIN<br/>\n\nJUDGE OF APPEAL</p>\n\n<p>Sgd:</p>\n\n<p>TAN LEE MENG<br/>\n\nJUDGE</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><!-- Conversion Tool Version 6.0.3 Prod --><CaseReport xlink:type=\"extended\" category=\"unreported\" neutralcitation=\"[2015] SGCA 52\" year=\"\" volume=\"\" series=\"\" pageno=\"\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:exslt=\"http://exslt.org/common\">\n  <Metadata id=\"17978-SSP\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/[2015] SGCA 0052.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2015-10-06T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2015-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    \n    <IndexYear>2015</IndexYear>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>[2015]</Year>\n      <Volume/>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>52</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2015] SGCA 52</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>[2015]</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>52</No>\n      <NCit>[2015] SGCA 52</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <CaseTitle>Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</SortTitle><SortDate>2015-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    \n    <CaseNumber>Civil Appeal No 22 of 2015</CaseNumber>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram>Chao Hick Tin JA</Coram>\n      <Coram>Judith Prakash J</Coram>\n      <Coram>Quentin Loh J</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>Twiss, Christopher James Hans</Party>\n      <Party>Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <AdditionalCaseDetails>\n      <CaseTitle>Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</CaseTitle>\n    </AdditionalCaseDetails>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Tan Xuan Qi Dorothy (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Isaac Tito Shane, Justin Chan Yew Loong and Zee Ning En Jasmine Mildred (Tito Isaac &amp;

The judge below (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) had ordered that (i)\u00a0the matrimonial home and the sale proceeds of a Malaysian property, which were the only assets up for division, be given entirely to the wife, and (ii)\u00a0the husband pay the wife maintenance in the sum of $4,000 a month.

We affirmed the Judge\u2019s order that the husband pay the wife maintenance in the sum of $4,000 a month but ordered that the assets be divided instead, in the proportions of 75% to the wife and 25% to the husband. We now explain in greater detail our decision to allow the appeal in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. We do so with a view to reaffirm the principles and approach set out in this court\u2019s recent decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ v ANK</Emphasis> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ\u00a0v ANK</Emphasis>\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Background facts</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband is 49 years old and the wife is 51. They are both UK citizens and they were married there on 4\u00a0August 1989. They have two sons: the older son is 21\u00a0years old while the younger son is 19. The husband filed a writ for divorce in July 2008 and interim judgment was granted two years later in June 2010. The marriage spanned about 20\u00a0years.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">At the hearing before us, Mr\u00a0Tito Isaac, appearing for the wife, put forward a version of the facts which Miss\u00a0Dorothy Tan, appearing for the husband, did not object to and which we therefore accepted as true. In 1991, not long after the parties were married, the husband moved to Hong Kong for work. The wife gave up her job to follow him. In 1994, the older son was born. In April 1995, when the wife was pregnant with the younger son and the older son was 10\u00a0months old, the husband had to relocate for work once again, this time to Seattle. Again, the family moved with him. The younger son was born in 1996, and when he was just 10\u00a0days old, the husband lost his job and the family was compelled to move to Geneva. In 1997, the family moved one last time, to Singapore.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">If the first decade of the marriage was characterised by continual geographical displacement, the second was defined by the husband\u2019s infidelities. In 2000, when the sons were five and three years old, the husband left the family for his first mistress, returning after six months. In 2004, the husband left for his second mistress. This time, he stayed out for a year before returning home. Finally, in 2007, the husband embarked on his third affair. On this occasion, he left and never came back.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The matrimonial assets</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Before the Judge, it was agreed that each party would keep the assets held in their own names. That left two assets to be divided. The first was the matrimonial home. This was registered in the parties\u2019 joint names. Its value was approximately $3.8\u00a0million, with an outstanding loan of $536,103.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The second was a property in Malaysia that had been sold at some point prior to the proceedings before the Judge. The proceeds from the sale, converted from Malaysian to local currency, amounted to $287,802. The husband said that this entire sum was kept by the wife and she did not seem to dispute this.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The Judge\u2019s decision</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge gave his decision in an oral judgment which does not appear to have been published. In relation to the matrimonial home, he found that the parties\u2019 direct financial contributions were as follows. On the wife\u2019s part, she had contributed $275,698.01 in CPF monies, $190,000 in cash towards the deposit and initial payment, and $389,427 in mortgage payments \u2013 these payments were in cash as well as CPF monies. On the husband\u2019s part, he had contributed $118,486.23 in CPF monies and $190,000 in cash towards the deposit and initial payment. On this basis, the Judge held that parties\u2019 direct financial contributions towards the matrimonial home were in the ratio of 75:25 (in the round) in the wife\u2019s favour.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"9\" pID=\"p1_9\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Turning then to the indirect contributions, the Judge accepted that the husband \u201chad left the matrimonial home on about three occasions to stay with his mistresses leaving the wife to look after the family\u201d. He then found that the wife\u2019s \u201cindirect contributions are about 20%\u201d. What exactly the Judge meant by this is perhaps obscure, but given that he opined thereafter that \u201cthe wife\u2019s share of the matrimonial home amounts to 95% of its net value\u201d, he must have given a 20% uplift to the wife on account of her indirect contributions which was added to the 75% that represented the wife\u2019s direct financial contributions.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As for the Malaysian property and the proceeds from its sale, the Judge only said that it \u201cshould be included into the pool of matrimonial assets for division\u201d. He made no finding on the parties\u2019 direct financial contributions to this property. He then expressed the view that \u201ca fair and equitable division of the net value of the matrimonial properties\u201d \u2013 which presumably included the sale proceeds of the Malaysian property \u2013 was \u201c95:5 in favour of the wife\u201d.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"11\" pID=\"p1_11\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Although the Judge said that the assets were to be divided in the ratio of 95:5 in the wife\u2019s favour, the order he actually made did not seem consistent with that determination. His order was that the husband \u201ctransfer his rights, title and interests\u201d in the matrimonial home, with the wife to \u201cbear the related costs and expenses of the transfer\u201d. There was no order that the wife furnish consideration or value for this transfer. Neither was there any order that the wife transfer to the husband part of the sale proceeds of the Malaysian property held by her. In these circumstances, notwithstanding the 95:5 ratio expressly articulated by the Judge, we were compelled to conclude that he had actually decided that the assets should be divided in the ratio of 100:0 in the wife\u2019s favour. In other words, he gave all the matrimonial assets, which should have been divided, entirely to the wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The husband\u2019s contentions</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Before us, Miss\u00a0Tan argued that the Judge had understated the husband\u2019s direct financial contributions to the matrimonial home to the extent that he had failed to give the husband some credit for the mortgage payments that had been made from the proceeds of renting out the matrimonial home during the period from May\u00a02008 to August 2013. Miss\u00a0Tan said that if this error was corrected, the ratio of parties\u2019 direct financial contributions to the matrimonial home would be 70:30 in the wife\u2019s favour and not 75:25 as the Judge had found.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Miss\u00a0Tan further contended that the Judge had also undervalued the husband\u2019s indirect contributions to the marriage. She accepted that in the second decade of the marriage, the wife\u2019s indirect contributions had been greater than the husband\u2019s given that he had left the family on multiple occasions to be with the other women. But she pointed out that the husband had nonetheless contributed to some degree during this second decade, for instance, contributing $4,000 a month to the household and paying the sons\u2019 school fees which amounted to some $100,000 a year. Miss\u00a0Tan argued that the first decade of the marriage had also to be taken into account, and during that period the husband\u2019s indirect contributions had been substantial. She said, bearing all these in mind, a fair ratio of the parties\u2019 indirect contributions over the entire period of the marriage should be 70:30 in the wife\u2019s favour.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Relying on <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ v ANK</Emphasis>, Miss Tan argued that if the ratio of the parties\u2019 direct financial contributions was 70:30 and the ratio of their indirect contributions was precisely the same, the matrimonial assets should be divided in the ratio of 70:30 in favour of the wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Our decision</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"15\" pID=\"p1_15\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In advancing her arguments, Miss\u00a0Tan highlighted the fact that the Judge had erred in law by applying what was generally known as the \u201cuplift\u201d methodology. This error consisted of taking the view that the wife\u2019s indirect contributions should be reflected by applying an \u201cuplift\u201d to the share she would have been entitled to on the basis of her direct financial contributions only. We accepted Miss\u00a0Tan\u2019s contentions on this score and we considered that the Judge had erred in that regard. This court warned against the use of the \u201cuplift\u201d methodology in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ v ANK</Emphasis> and referred to some possible pitfalls of that methodology (at [18]\u2013[20]). We reaffirm what was said there.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"16\" pID=\"p1_16\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We were of the view that the Judge\u2019s decision to award the entirety of the matrimonial assets to the wife was untenable. Such a division could be justified only in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances, <Emphasis type=\"i\">eg</Emphasis>, where the husband\u2019s direct financial contributions and indirect contributions amounted to nothing at all, or where his contributions were very insignificant and it was thought fit to draw an adverse inference against him such as to reduce his share to zero. We did not think that such extreme circumstances obtained in the present case. To all intents and purposes, during the first decade of the marriage, the husband fulfilled his role as a family man, caring and providing for the entire family. While he strayed during the second decade of the marriage, he had nevertheless provided financially for the family.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We were therefore of the opinion that it was just that we should allow the husband\u2019s appeal. In determining what would be a fair and equitable division of the assets, we followed the structured approach set out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ v ANK</Emphasis> (at [22]\u2013[27]), which comprises the following broad steps:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_17-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Express as a ratio the parties\u2019 direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_17-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Express as a second ratio the parties\u2019 indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(c)\" pID=\"p1_17-p2_c\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Derive the parties\u2019 overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above, keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other.</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Applying this structured approach to the matrimonial home, we began with parties\u2019 direct financial contributions. In this connection, we accepted Miss\u00a0Tan\u2019s argument that the correct ratio was 70:30 in the wife\u2019s favour and not 75:25. We accepted her contention that the husband should be given some measure of credit for the mortgage payments that had been made out of the proceeds of renting out the matrimonial home for the period from May\u00a02008 to August 2013 at $7,800 a month. It was not disputed that the wife had paid $1,500 in CPF monies and $1,405 in cash per month towards the mortgage during that period. The cash component was paid out of the rental proceeds, which ought to be considered as belonging jointly to the parties, as this was income earned on an asset that was jointly owned. Thus, it was only fair that half of the $1,405 cash payment of the mortgage instalments during that period should be regarded as having been contributed by the husband.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Doing the arithmetic, it would mean that, having contributed $702.50 per month over the 63 months from May 2008 to August 2013, the husband had contributed $44,257.50 more and the wife $44,257.50 less than what the Judge thought that they had. This meant that the husband\u2019s direct financial contributions to the matrimonial home amounted to $352,743.73 and the wife\u2019s $810,867.51. The ratio representing their direct financial contributions was therefore approximately 70:30 in the wife\u2019s favour.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"20\" pID=\"p1_20\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Turning to the question of indirect contributions, as stated in [16] above, there is a need to differentiate between the first and the second decades of the marriage. In the first decade of the marriage, it appeared to us that the parties\u2019 indirect contributions were roughly equal, except that the nature of their contributions were different in that the husband met the family\u2019s financial needs and took care of the family wherever he could whilst the wife took primary care of the family in the domestic sphere, although we noted that the wife also worked from 1989 to 1991 and so also contributed financially to that extent. In the second decade of the marriage, however, we thought that the wife\u2019s indirect contributions far exceeded those of the husband\u2019s given his physical absence from the family for substantial lengths of time while recognising that even then he did contribute financially to the family. Still, his indirect contributions paled in comparison to those of the wife who had effectively taken sole charge of raising the sons from the ages of five and three. In all the circumstances, taking a broad-brush approach, we thought that the parties\u2019 indirect contributions relative to each other would be fairly represented by a ratio of 75:25 in the wife\u2019s favour.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"21\" pID=\"p1_21\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ v ANK</Emphasis>, this court opined (at [27]) that (i)\u00a0indirect contributions tend to feature more prominently in long marriages, (ii)\u00a0direct contributions would command greater weight where the pool of assets was extraordinarily large and all of the assets were accrued by one party\u2019s exceptional efforts, and (iii)\u00a0courts tend to lean in favour of homemakers who have painstakingly raised children to adulthood at the expense of their careers. In the present case, the marriage was a fairly lengthy one, the pool of matrimonial assets was not particularly large, and it seemed to us that the wife had made career sacrifices for the sake of the family. We were thus of the view that, in this case, the indirect contributions ought to be given more weight than the direct financial contributions.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"22\" pID=\"p1_22\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Given that the disparity between the ratio of direct financial contributions, 70:30, and the ratio of the indirect contributions, 75:25, was rather small, we thought that it would not be inapt simply to take the latter ratio as representative of the parties\u2019 overall contributions to the matrimonial home. We therefore took the view that a fair and equitable division of the matrimonial home would be in the proportions of 75% to the wife and 25% to the husband.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">There remained the proceeds of the sale of the Malaysian property. In this regard we were handicapped by a dearth of information as to parties\u2019 direct financial contributions to the property. Given such a situation, we thought it would be neither unfair nor inequitable to order that the sale proceeds be divided in the same manner as the matrimonial home.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For these reasons, we ordered that the matrimonial home and the proceeds from the sale of the Malaysian property be divided in the proportions of 75% to the wife and 25% to the husband. We left it to the parties to work out the practical implementation of this order, in particular, the question of whether the matrimonial home should be sold and the proceeds divided, or the wife should buy out the husband\u2019s share \u2013 and if the latter, by what means.</Text>\n      </Para>\n    </Judgment>\n  </Judgments>\n</CaseReport></mainContent></searchResponse>\n",

align=\"left\">There are two appeals and one application before this court arising out of ancillary matters concerning the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance in a divorce proceeding. The ancillary matters were heard before the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) and her decision is reported at <Emphasis type=\"i\">TDS v TDT</Emphasis> [2015] SGHCF 7 (\u201cthe GD\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"2\" pID=\"p1_2\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Civil Appeal No\u00a0119 of 2015 (\u201cCA\u00a0119/2015\u201d) is the Husband\u2019s appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision. In the main, he appeals against how the Judge valued the shares of a particular company which was found liable to be divided as a matrimonial asset. The Husband also seeks a refund of the interim maintenance paid to Q, the Wife\u2019s daughter who was born out of wedlock from a previous relationship (see also below at [5]). The latter point raises interesting questions pertaining to the scope and operation of s\u00a070 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d) which have hitherto not been considered by this court.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Civil Appeal No\u00a0120 of 2015 (\u201cCA\u00a0120/2015\u201d) is the Wife\u2019s cross-appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision. She seeks an upward revision of the proportion of the matrimonial assets which she was awarded. She also seeks an award of nominal maintenance, which gives us an opportunity to elaborate on the principles of nominal maintenance recently laid down by this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ATE v ATD and another appeal</Emphasis> [2016] SGCA 2 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">ATE\u00a0v\u00a0ATD</Emphasis>\u201d). The Wife also applies in Summons No\u00a015 of 2016 (\u201cSUM\u00a015/2016\u201d) to adduce fresh evidence on appeal. The evidence sought to be adduced came into existence only after the Judge had handed down her decision.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For ease of reference, the nomenclature used in the GD shall be adopted in this judgment.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The background facts</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The parties began a relationship in about 2003. At the time, the Husband was in the process of divorcing his wife from his first marriage. On 17\u00a0October 2006, the parties married. The marriage lasted for 4.5\u00a0years. There are no children to the marriage between the parties, though the Wife has a daughter, Q, who was born out of wedlock from a previous relationship.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">After the parties were married, the couple, Q, and the Wife\u2019s mother stayed together in an apartment unit at the Park Green condominium development (\u201cthe Park Green apartment\u201d), which was owned by the Wife and her sister. They stayed there from October 2006 until sometime in 2009. In late 2009, the couple moved to a house located at Lentor Vale. Q did not move to Lentor Vale with the couple and continued to live in the Park Green apartment with the Wife\u2019s mother and sister.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On 4\u00a0April 2011, an incident occurred between the couple. This resulted in the Wife leaving the Lentor Vale property permanently. She also applied for, and obtained, an expedited personal protection order against the Husband. This marked a significant point in the breakdown of the marriage. Divorce proceedings commenced on 27\u00a0September 2011 and interim judgment for divorce was granted on 18\u00a0December 2013.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Wife also applied for and obtained an order that the Husband was to pay interim maintenance of $12,500 per month ($10,000 for the Wife and $2,500 for Q) from 1\u00a0May 2011. Upon the Husband\u2019s application for a downward variation of interim maintenance in December 2013, the District Judge reduced the interim maintenance for the Wife and Q to $10,500 a month ($8,000 for the Wife and $2,500 for Q) with effect from November 2012 (see the decision of District Judge\u00a0Wong Keen Onn (\u201cDJ\u00a0Wong\u201d) in Summons No\u00a0[A] of 2012 (\u201cSUM\u00a0[A]\u201d)). The parties\u2019 cross-appeals against DJ Wong\u2019s decision were dismissed by Tay Yong Kwang\u00a0J on 23\u00a0April 2014. At the time of the hearing before the Judge in March 2015, the Husband had paid a total of $533,500 in interim maintenance for the Wife and Q. The Husband, Wife and Q were at the time of the hearing of the ancillary matters before the Judge, 53, 51 and 19\u00a0years old, respectively.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The matrimonial assets relevant to the present appeal</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"9\" pID=\"p1_9\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">There are five companies which were incorporated by the Husband that are relevant to the present appeals.

The primary business of the company was originally to market and sell the \u201cSingapore Sling premix\u201d as well as service and maintain beer dispensers and cooling units. Its business was re-organised in 2004. Presently, the Husband owns 100% of the shares in BPL.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_9-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">APL: APL was incorporated in December 2004 to take over the business of marketing and selling the \u201cSingapore Sling premix\u201d from BPL. The Husband owns 83.5% of the shares of APL, and the remaining 16.5% of the shares are owned by two of the Wife\u2019s friends.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(c)\" pID=\"p1_9-p2_c\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">BSPL: BSPL was incorporated in December 2004 to take over the business of servicing and maintaining beer dispensers and cooling units from BPL. The Husband owns 90% of the shares of BSPL with the remaining 10% owned by one of BSPL\u2019s employees. The parties agree that at the time of the ancillary matters hearing, BSPL was no longer operating as a going concern although they differ as to why this was the case. The Husband alleges that the Wife diverted BSPL\u2019s business to companies that she has an interest in, whereas the Wife states that BSPL lost its business because of the lackadaisical manner in which the Husband ran the company after the marriage had broken down.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(d)\" pID=\"p1_9-p2_d\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">CPL: CPL was incorporated in April 2005 to sell \u201cSingapore Tourist Passes\u201d. The business did not take off and CPL has been dormant since 2012. The Husband and Wife own 95% and 5% of the shares of CPL, respectively.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(e)\" pID=\"p1_9-p2_e\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">DPL: DPL was incorporated in August 2000 and the Husband owns 100% of the shares in the company.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It is undisputed that during the course of the marriage, the Wife was involved in running both APL and BSPL. Also, the parties not infrequently charged their personal expenses to these companies\u2019 accounts (especially to BSPL\u2019s account).</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Besides these five companies, there are also three immovable properties relevant to the present appeals:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_10-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">A warehouse located at Admiralty Street\u00a0(\u201cthe Admiralty Street property\u201d). It appears to have been purchased in June 2010 by BSPL for $700,000. After being purchased by BSPL, it appears that <Emphasis type=\"i\">APL</Emphasis> (and <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> BSPL) had mortgaged the property to United Overseas Bank Ltd for a loan facility of $500,000. The Husband suggests that the Admiralty Street property was purchased in August 2010, but in support of his suggestion he relies on a document that in fact deals with <Emphasis type=\"i\">another</Emphasis> unit located at Admiralty Street. The Admiralty Street property was transferred to DPL for a consideration of $800,000 sometime in April 2012 (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, after the commencement of divorce proceedings). However, no sale and purchase agreement between BSPL and DPL was exhibited.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_10-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">A landed property located at Andrews Terrace (\u201cthe Andrews Terrace property\u201d). The Andrews Terrace property was purchased on 13\u00a0November 2010 for $1.85m and was financed by the Husband and the Husband\u2019s father. The renovation work on the property amounted to $400,000. The Wife states that this was paid with funds that came from APL and BSPL, whereas the Husband\u2019s position is that the renovation was funded by money from a bank account that was originally a joint account held by the Husband and his father.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(c)\" pID=\"p1_10-p2_c\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">An apartment located at a condominium development at Hougang Street known as the Minton (\u201cthe Minton property\u201d).

The main dispute that remains on-going between the parties is Suit No\u00a0[B] of 2011 (\u201cSuit\u00a0[B]\u201d). Suit\u00a0[B] was commenced by BSPL on 20\u00a0July 2011 against the Wife and four other defendants. The causes of action are, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, breaches of fiduciary duty, conspiracy to defraud and misuse of confidential information. On 24\u00a0February 2012, Suit\u00a0[B] was consolidated with Suit No\u00a0[C] of 2011 (\u201cSuit\u00a0[C]\u201d), which was an action commenced by BSPL against the Wife and five other defendants. The causes of action in Suit\u00a0[C] were, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, breach of copyright, breach of confidentiality obligations and breach of non-competition obligations. Subsequently, in April 2013, BSPL discontinued Suit\u00a0[B] as against the other defendants and currently only the claims against the Wife remains. On 20\u00a0January 2014, Suit\u00a0[B] was stayed by Lee Seiu Kin\u00a0J pending the resolution of these appeals.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The gist of BSPL\u2019s action against the Wife in Suit\u00a0[B] is for the alleged diversion of a specific business opportunity, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the opportunity for BSPL to supply mashed potato machines to 7-Eleven, to another company known as [X] Pte Ltd (\u201cXPL\u201d) in July 2010. The Wife\u2019s pleaded defence is that XPL took up the opportunity with the knowledge and consent of both the Husband and BSPL, and that XPL had agreed to pay BSPL a fee for doing so. The Wife pleaded that she had earned an arrangement fee (termed as \u201cmashed potato commissions\u201d), but that this was also with the consent of BSPL and the Husband. In the alternative, the Wife stated that there was an agreement between her, BSPL and the Husband that she could retain all fees from this arrangement \u201cas part of her matrimonial maintenance and expenses\u201d. Additionally, she counterclaimed against BSPL for damages arising from the wrongful termination of her employment and commenced a third party action against the Husband seeking an indemnity for any sums she might be found to be liable to pay BSPL on the basis that:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">By an agreement, understanding and/or arrangement for matrimonial maintenance and expenses reached between the [Husband] and the [Wife], in consideration of the [Wife] agreeing to marry [the Husband] and the [Wife] marrying the [Husband], further or in the alternative, in consideration of the [Husband\u2019s] obligations to the [Wife] under section\u00a069(1) of the Women\u2019s Charter, the [Husband] covenanted with the [Wife] that her matrimonial maintenance and expenses would be provided/supplemented through payments, salaries and fees the [Wife] receives in connection with the business of the companies which is controlled by the [Husband], which includes [BSPL].</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As an aside, and by purely way of observation, the state of affairs between the parties in relation to Suit\u00a0[B] is a strange one. It appears that even after these ancillary matters are dealt with, the issue of maintenance will still be revisited in Suit\u00a0[B] as part of the Wife\u2019s defence against BSPL\u2019s claim and her claim against the Husband (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the Wife\u2019s third party proceedings for an indemnity in Suit\u00a0[B]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"15\" pID=\"p1_15\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Wife had also commenced actions against the Husband and his companies. District Court Suit No\u00a0[D] of 2011 was an action by the Wife against APL for unpaid salary amounting to $161,000. She was awarded the sum of $151,400 on her appeal to Lee Kim Shin\u00a0JC in District Court Appeal No\u00a0[E] of 2013. Separately, the Wife commenced Suit No\u00a0[F] of 2012 against the Husband, claiming for damages for pain and suffering relating to the alleged scuffle that occurred on 4\u00a0April 2011. This action was settled with the Husband paying the Wife $26,341.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"16\" pID=\"p1_16\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">After the Judge\u2019s decision was handed down, it appears that the Husband and BSPL commenced District Court Suit No\u00a0[G] of 2015 (\u201cDC\u00a0[G]\u201d) on 3\u00a0September 2015, claiming for the return of a sum of $157,202.57 under an alleged loan agreement. By SUM\u00a015/2016, the Wife seeks to admit correspondence and cause papers relating to DC\u00a0[G] as fresh evidence in these appeals.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The decision below</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge began by identifying the assets which fell within the pool of matrimonial assets liable to division under s\u00a0112 of the Act. She found that the Wife was intimately involved in the running of APL and BSPL and that BPL and CPL appeared to be part of the group of companies that the parties managed during the marriage. In the Judge\u2019s view, it was appropriate to treat the Husband\u2019s shares in APL, BPL, BSPL and CPL as matrimonial assets liable for division (\u201cthe Major Assets\u201d). The Judge also included the value of the Admiralty Street property (fixed at $1.54m) in the valuation of BSPL, even though the Admiralty Street property, at the time of the hearing, was registered in the name of DPL, a company solely owned by the Husband. The Judge found that the Admiralty Street property had been transferred from BSPL to DPL after the divorce proceedings commenced ostensibly for the purpose of reducing the value of the pool of matrimonial assets liable for division. She therefore valued the shares of APL, BPL, BSPL and CPL at a total of $5,033,183, computed as follows:</Text>\n        <table frame=\"all\" align=\"left\" pgwide=\"1\">\n          <tgroup cols=\"3\"

Andrews Terrace property and the Minton property were matrimonial assets to be included in the division exercise, it appears that the Judge had regard to these assets and the contributions made by the parties in coming to her decision on the just and equitable division of the Major Assets. She also took into account the short and childless nature of the marriage, the Wife\u2019s contributions in increasing the value of APL and BSPL, the various non-disclosures by both parties and the Wife\u2019s diversion of some of BSPL\u2019s business to herself (which the Judge was satisfied had happened) in arriving at her decision that the just and equitable division would be to award the Wife 30% of the value of the Husband\u2019s shares in APL, BPL, BSPL and CPL (with the value of BSPL increased to include the value of the Admiralty Street property).

First, he argues that the Admiralty Street property ought not to have been included as part of the value of BSPL. Second, he submits that the Judge had erred in computing the value of BSPL as $1,158,329. The Husband also appeals against the Judge\u2019s decision not to award him a refund of the interim maintenance paid to Q. In this regard, he seeks a full refund of the interim maintenance paid, primarily on the basis that the objective evidence showed that he had not accepted Q as a member of his family. The interim maintenance paid by the Husband to Q amounted to a total of $117,500 as at March 2015.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"22\" pID=\"p1_22\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In CA\u00a0120/2015, the Wife raises three areas of contention. First, she seeks an upward revision of her proportion of the division of the Major Assets from 30% to 60%. She contends that while the Judge was cognisant of her substantial contributions to the companies, the Judge had failed to translate that recognition to an appropriate award in so far as the division of those assets was concerned. Second, the Wife submits that the Judge had erred in valuing BPL at $152,928. Instead, the appropriate value to be adopted is $1,622,603. Finally, the Wife seeks an award of maintenance that is dependent upon the outcome of Suit\u00a0[B] (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, if she is not entitled to keep the mashed potato commissions, an order should be made for the Husband to pay the Wife maintenance of $4,500 for eight years) or for an award of nominal maintenance of $1. In so far as the argument that she should be awarded nominal maintenance is concerned, the Wife applies in SUM\u00a015/2016 for leave to adduce fresh evidence on appeal which, in the main, consists of correspondence and cause papers pertaining to DC\u00a0[G]. She argues that as these materials came into existence after the Judge\u2019s decision, the requirements set out in the leading English Court of Appeal decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Ladd v Marshall</Emphasis> [1954] 1\u00a0WLR 1489 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Ladd v Marshall</Emphasis>\u201d) do not apply. Through the fresh evidence, the Wife seeks to bolster her argument that she should be awarded nominal maintenance in order to hedge against the risk that her financial resources will be depleted by the Husband\u2019s alleged legal tirade against her.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The issues before this court</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The following issues arise for our determination in CA\u00a0119/2015 and CA\u00a0120/2015:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_23-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">whether the valuation of the shares of BSPL should include the Admiralty Street property, and if so, the appropriate value to be ascribed to BSPL\u2019s shares (\u201cIssue\u00a01\u201d);</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_23-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the value to be ascribed to BPL\u2019s shares (\u201cIssue\u00a02\u201d);</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(c)\" pID=\"p1_23-p2_c\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the just and equitable division of the Major Assets (\u201cIssue\u00a03\u201d);</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(d)\" pID=\"p1_23-p2_d\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">whether the Wife should be awarded maintenance (\u201cIssue\u00a04\u201d); and</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(e)\" pID=\"p1_23-p2_e\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">whether the Husband\u2019s claim for a refund of interim maintenance paid to Q should be allowed (\u201cIssue\u00a05\u201d).</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Before dealing with the substantive issues in this appeal, we address SUM\u00a015/2016.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">SUM\u00a015/2016: The Wife\u2019s application to admit fresh evidence</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"25\" pID=\"p1_25\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The power of the Court of Appeal to admit fresh evidence is found in s\u00a037(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 2007 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe SCJA\u201d).

The second category encompasses correspondence and cause papers relating to DC\u00a0[G] which, as stated above (at [16]), is a claim filed by the Husband and BSPL against the Wife on 3\u00a0September 2015, after the Judge had delivered her judgment on the ancillary matters.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Counsel for the Husband stated during oral submissions before us that he was not objecting to the Wife\u2019s application in SUM\u00a015/2016, except to point out that the documents which the Wife was seeking to adduce were, in his view, not relevant to the disposal of the appeals.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"28\" pID=\"p1_28\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Having perused the documents, we agree that the further evidence which formed the subject of the first category was not relevant to the issues in these appeals.

To the extent that the gravamen of the Wife\u2019s complaints consists in her inability to enforce the Judge\u2019s decision against the Husband, her remedies lie in taking out the appropriate applications, and not in an appeal to this court.

He submits, first, that the Judge was wrong to have included the value of the Admiralty Street property in the value of BSPL\u2019s shares. Secondly, he argues that the Judge adopted the wrong expert report for the valuation of BSPL. We consider each contention in turn.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Whether the Admiralty Street property should be included in the valuation</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"32\" pID=\"p1_32\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It will be recalled that the Admiralty Street property was purchased by BSPL sometime in 2010 and that it had been transferred from BSPL to DPL in April 2012, <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> the commencement of divorce proceedings. At the hearing below, the parties\u2019 arguments focussed on whether the Admiralty Street property should be included as a standalone asset in the pool of matrimonial assets liable for division, since it had been transferred out of BSPL\u2019s ownership. The Judge did not adopt the approach canvassed by the parties. In her view, the transfer of the Admiralty Street property from BSPL to DPL after the commencement of divorce proceedings was done \u201cseemingly for the [Husband\u2019s] benefit after the filing of the writ of divorce\u201d (see the GD at [32]). As BSPL had owned the Admiralty Street property and the Husband had not accounted for the transfer of the property to DPL, the Judge considered that the Admiralty Street property ought to fall within the pool of matrimonial assets, albeit not as an asset in its own right, but rather as an asset owned by BSPL (see the GD at [22]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"33\" pID=\"p1_33\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Before us, the Husband argues that the Admiralty Street property should not fall within the pool of matrimonial assets, whether as a standalone asset or as an asset owned by BSPL, as it was acquired by way of gift or inheritance from his father. Hence, the Admiralty Street property, although acquired during the course of the marriage and in the name of BSPL, falls within the exception under s\u00a0112(10) of the Act, which provides that an asset acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and which had not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or both parties to the marriage would not fall within the pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband relies on evidence which he says demonstrates that the funds for the purchase of the Admiralty Street property effectively came, not from BSPL in whose name the property was registered, but from the Husband\u2019s father. His father had lent him the funds for the purchase of the Admiralty Street property, which he then inherited when his father passed away. In addition to the issue concerning the source of funds for the purchase of the Admiralty Street property, the Husband also submits that the Wife should not be awarded a share of the Admiralty Street property which was purchased for BSPL\u2019s business, when she had diverted this very business away from BSPL. Finally, the Husband also submits that excluding the Admiralty Street property from the pool of matrimonial assets would ensure a measure of parity with the way the Judge treated the Andrews Terrace property and the Minton property.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"34\" pID=\"p1_34\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We disagree with the Husband\u2019s characterisation of the Admiralty Street property as a \u201cgift or inheritance\u201d from his father to him. It is not disputed that the funds for BSPL\u2019s purchase of the Admiralty Street property came from the Husband\u2019s father. However, what is more important, in our view, is how the parties have recorded the use of the funds in the purchase. In this regard, the evidence demonstrates that the Husband\u2019s father did <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> intend his financial contribution to the purchase of the Admiralty Street property to be a <Emphasis type=\"i\">gift</Emphasis> of monies to the Husband. Rather, it is clear that the Husband\u2019s father\u2019s financial contributions to the purchase of the Admiralty Street property were treated and accounted for as a <Emphasis type=\"bi\">loan</Emphasis> to the Husband which had therefore to be repaid to him (the Husband\u2019s father). This is clear from the Husband\u2019s own evidence in his affidavit of asset and means (\u201cAOM\u201d) dated 21\u00a0February 2013 in which he states (at para\u00a021.19):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The purchase of [the Admiralty Street property] was carried out as follows: (a)\u00a0[BSPL] will purchase the [Admiralty Street property] from Ascendas (Admiralty) Pte Ltd at the effective price of S$615,900; (b)\u00a0[BSPL] also paid for the stamp duty on the option to purchase, which was S$15,600; (c)\u00a0my father <Emphasis type=\"i\">loaned me</Emphasis> S$600,800 for the purchase price and I in turn paid the purchase price to Ascendas; (d)\u00a0the monies were recorded as <Emphasis type=\"i\">a loan</Emphasis> to the company by me as a director of the company. The purchase of the unit was completed in June 2010. I inherited <Emphasis type=\"i\">the loan amount</Emphasis> from my father when he passed away in November 2010. [emphasis added]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"35\" pID=\"p1_35\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As is clear from the passage just quoted, the parties had effectively entered into two loans. First, the Husband\u2019s father had given the Husband a loan of $600,800, which the Husband then lent to BSPL for the purchase of the Admiralty Street property in its name. <Emphasis type=\"i\">Prima facie</Emphasis>, this demonstrates that the Admiralty Street property was <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis>, as the Husband seeks to characterise, \u201cinjected\u201d into BSPL as an asset in its name without BSPL being required to finance the purchase. Rather, to the extent that BSPL is required to repay the loan which is recorded in its books as being owed to the Husband, the Admiralty Street property is recognised at law to form part of the fixed assets owned by BSPL.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"36\" pID=\"p1_36\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">BSPL\u2019s books are also consistent with the position that a loan had in fact been granted by the Husband to BSPL. In BSPL\u2019s statement of financial position as at 31\u00a0December 2011, the amount due to a director was $475,604 in 2010 and $383,048 in 2011. In the absence of other evidence to the contrary, this demonstrates that the loan from the Husband to BSPL for the purchase of the Admiralty Street property was being progressively repaid by BSPL.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"37\" pID=\"p1_37\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We note that the Husband claims to have inherited the loan from his father after his father\u2019s death in November 2010. Even assuming the veracity of these claims, we do not think that it makes any difference to our analysis. Whatever the status of the loan arrangements between the Husband and his late father\u2019s estate, BSPL remains liable for the outstanding sum owed to <Emphasis type=\"i\">the Husband</Emphasis>. In other words, the status of the Husband\u2019s inheritance is <Emphasis type=\"i\">irrelevant</Emphasis> to the legal relationship <Emphasis type=\"i\">between BSPL and the Husband</Emphasis>. The fact remains that the Admiralty Street property was registered in BSPL\u2019s name, and BSPL financed the purchase of that property through monies <Emphasis type=\"i\">borrowed</Emphasis> from the Husband.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"38\" pID=\"p1_38\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In our view, the Husband has not provided any compelling reason to depart from the conclusion that the Admiralty Property forms part of the assets of BPSL. It is pertinent to note the undisputed fact that the Wife had contributed to the business of BSPL during the marriage, and that the parties had accepted that the shares of BSPL properly form part of the pool of matrimonial assets liable for division. Given these facts, there is no reason to exclude from division any asset registered in the name of BSPL and beneficially owned by BSPL. Moreover, we are not impressed by the orchestration of the transfer of the Admiralty Street property from BSPL to DPL by the Husband <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> the marriage had broken down and divorce proceedings had been commenced. We agree with the Judge\u2019s observations that this transfer appears to have taken place for the purpose of reducing the Husband\u2019s share of the assets liable for division. We therefore reject the Husband\u2019s backdoor attempt to remove the Admiralty Street property from the valuation of BSPL\u2019s shares. In the circumstances, the transfer should be disregarded, and the Admiralty Street property accounted for in the process of determining the value of the shares of BSPL.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"39\" pID=\"p1_39\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For completeness, we deal with the two further points raised by the Husband as stated above (at [33]). In so far as the issue of the Wife\u2019s alleged diversion of business is concerned, we consider that this is not a factor that ought to be taken to account in determining whether an asset is liable for division, at least on the facts of the present case. We also consider that the Judge ought not to have made a finding that the Wife had <Emphasis type=\"i\">diverted</Emphasis> BSPL\u2019s business. This will be discussed below at [66]\u2013[67].</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"40\" pID=\"p1_40\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Husband\u2019s further argument is that the exclusion of the Admiralty Street property from the pool of matrimonial assets would ensure some measure of parity with the Judge\u2019s treatment of the Andrews Terrace property and the Minton property. It is difficult to see how any parallel could be drawn between the Admiralty Street property on the one hand and the Andrews Terrace property and Minton property on the other since neither the Andrews Terrace property nor the Minton property was property that was owned by the Husband\u2019s companies. Therefore, we do not, with respect, consider this to be a relevant submission.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"41\" pID=\"p1_41\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We now proceed to determine the appropriate value to ascribe to BSPL\u2019s shares.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The appropriate value to ascribe to BSPL\u2019s shares</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"42\" pID=\"p1_42\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It is useful to commence the analysis by setting out the various valuations that have been made of BSPL by the Husband, the Husband\u2019s expert, Roc Partners Pte Ltd (\u201cROC\u201d), and the Wife\u2019s expert, Strix Strategies Pte Ltd (\u201cStrix\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"43\" pID=\"p1_43\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the Husband\u2019s AOM dated 21\u00a0February 2013, he stated that the estimated value of all the shares in BSPL was $240,755 as at 31\u00a0December 2010. The net tangible asset method, which involves a subtraction of the liabilities of the company from its assets, was used to arrive at this value. The Admiralty Street property was accounted for in this valuation based on the price of acquisition, and not its market value.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"44\" pID=\"p1_44\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In a further AOM filed on 10\u00a0September 2014, the Husband exhibited a report from ROC which valued the total equity of BSPL as being negative $196,105 as at 18\u00a0December 2012. In preparing this report, ROC made the assumption that the Admiralty Street property was never purchased in BSPL\u2019s name. The Husband also exhibited a separate report from ROC dated 6\u00a0August 2014 which sought to value the shares of BSPL as at 31\u00a0December 2010 by employing a discounted free cash flow and market comparables methodology. The valuation in this latter report was prepared on the assumption that BSPL would continue to operate as a going concern without any diversion of its existing business. On this basis, ROC valued the total equity in BSPL as at 31\u00a0December 2010 at a sum of $1,158,329. The purpose of this report, which the Husband had commissioned, was to demonstrate that the Wife\u2019s act of diverting BSPL\u2019s business had caused a significant decrease in the value of BSPL\u2019s shares.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"45\" pID=\"p1_45\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Wife engaged her own expert, Strix, to value BSPL\u2019s shares. In her AOM dated 10\u00a0September 2014, the Wife exhibited a report prepared by Strix dated 28\u00a0October 2013. In this report, Strix noted that the net asset value of BSPL was $240,755 as at 31\u00a0December 2010, which is consistent with the Husband\u2019s valuation (see above at [43]). Strix opined that the estimate of BSPL\u2019s net asset value should be increased to $830,849 in order to account for the increase in market value of the Admiralty Street property.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"46\" pID=\"p1_46\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Strix prepared a subsequent report dated 28\u00a0August 2014 which valued BSPL\u2019s shares at $825,692. This sum was derived by adding the net asset value of BSPL as at 31\u00a0December 2010 (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, $240,755) with the gain made by BSPL from the sale of the Admiralty Street property to DPL (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, $109,333) and sums due from BSPL to the Husband (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, $475,604).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"47\" pID=\"p1_47\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Further reports were prepared by the respective parties\u2019 experts after the Judge indicated during a hearing that she was inclined to proceed on valuations of the companies as close to the hearing date as possible. In a report dated 21\u00a0April 2015, ROC valued the net asset value of BSPL as at 31\u00a0December 2014 as being negative $482,887. Strix, too, furnished a report dated 29\u00a0April 2015. While no valuation of the shares of BSPL was provided in this report, Strix queried whether BSPL\u2019s losses (as referred to in ROC\u2019s report dated 21\u00a0April 2015) were genuine or were, instead, \u201crandom charges to the accounts for expenses\u201d.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"48\" pID=\"p1_48\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">To reiterate, the Judge valued the shares of BSPL at $1,158,329, adding a sum of $1,540,000 to that value in order to account for the Admiralty Street property. It is clear, in our view, that the Judge valued the shares of BSPL based on the ROC report dated 6\u00a0August 2014 which adopted a methodology that assumed that BSPL would continue operating as a going concern (see above at [44]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"49\" pID=\"p1_49\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Husband points out that the Judge\u2019s decision to determine the value of BSPL on the basis of the ROC report dated 6\u00a0August 2014 appears to be out of sync with the Judge\u2019s stated preference to proceed on valuations of the Major Assets that were as close to the hearing date as possible (see the GD at [30]). As stated in the ROC report, the value of $1,158,329 was ROC\u2019s estimate of the fair value of BSPL\u2019s equity <Emphasis type=\"i\">as at 31\u00a0December 2010</Emphasis>. Thus, the Husband argues that the Judge should have adopted a more updated valuation of BSPL based on the ROC report dated 21\u00a0April 2015, which valued BSPL\u2019s shares at a negative value as at 31\u00a0December 2014 (see above at [47]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"50\" pID=\"p1_50\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The general position is that the date of the hearing is the date that should be adopted for the purposes of valuing the matrimonial assets: see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong Lin</Emphasis> at [39]. Although framed as an imperative in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong Lin</Emphasis>, we do not think that the position that the value of a matrimonial asset \u201cmust be assessed at the date of the hearing\u201d is a hard and fast rule. In <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter</Emphasis> [2012] 4\u00a0SLR 405 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Wan Lai Cheng</Emphasis>\u201d), this court valued matrimonial properties on a date prior to the hearing of the ancillary matters. This was because the court found (at [71]) that before the hearing of the ancillary matters, the husband had increased the liabilities of the matrimonial assets, and that the increased liabilities were not incurred for the family\u2019s benefit. The court in that case also stated (at [67]) that in general, the starting point for determining the liabilities charged against properties (for the purposes of calculating the net asset value) would be as at the date of commencement of the divorce proceedings because once divorce proceedings are commenced, neither spouse should be allowed to dispose of or incur any liability on assets to the detriment of the other spouse. In our view, the court retains the discretion to depart from the date of the ancillary matters hearing in determining the value of properties subject to division where this is warranted by the facts. Indeed, this very point was reiterated in our recent decision in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ARX\u00a0v\u00a0ARY and another appeal</Emphasis> [2016] 2\u00a0SLR 686 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">ARX\u00a0v\u00a0ARY</Emphasis>\u201d) (at [36]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"51\" pID=\"p1_51\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the present case, there are ample reasons <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> to adopt the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters for the purpose of valuing BSPL\u2019s shares. It may be recalled that BSPL had, on 20\u00a0July 2011, commenced Suit\u00a0[B] against the Wife and other related defendants. Suit [C] was commenced a few months later on 16\u00a0September 2011. In the Husband\u2019s AOM filed on 10\u00a0September 2014, he disclosed that BSPL had incurred $572,653.37 in legal fees. Clearly, these liabilities would have been incurred to the Wife\u2019s detriment. Also, as we had noted above (at [38]), the Admiralty Street property had been sold to DPL seemingly as part of the Husband\u2019s attempt to diminish his share of the matrimonial assets liable for division. Furthermore, the Wife had been removed as a director of BSPL on 9\u00a0May 2011. The Husband thus had free rein in respect of BSPL\u2019s finances. There is a not negligible possibility that the Husband might have managed BSPL\u2019s finances to the Wife\u2019s detriment. Indeed, as pointed out by Strix in their report dated 29\u00a0April 2015, there is a lack of clarity as to why the finances of BSPL deteriorated so substantially between 2010 and 2013. On the other hand, the Husband has also alleged that the Wife diverted the business of BSPL post-2010. In all the circumstances, and in line with the principle espoused in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wan Lai Cheng</Emphasis>, we find it fair and appropriate to value BSPL\u2019s shares on a date <Emphasis type=\"i\">prior</Emphasis> to the breakdown of the marriage in April 2011 and the commencement of divorce proceedings in September 2011 so as to arrive at a value of BSPL <Emphasis type=\"i\">before</Emphasis> the alleged dissipation of BSPL\u2019s assets by the Husband and the alleged diversion of BSPL\u2019s business by the Wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"52\" pID=\"p1_52\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We therefore refer to the expert reports that value BSPL\u2019s shares as at 31\u00a0December 2010. Two valuation methods have been employed to value the shares of BSPL at this date, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the net asset method (adopted by the Husband and Strix) and the discounted free cash flow and market comparables method (adopted by ROC in its report dated 6\u00a0August 2014). The Judge adopted the valuation derived through the latter approach.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"53\" pID=\"p1_53\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Between the two approaches to valuation set out in the preceding paragraph, we would prefer to utilise the net asset valuation method. We find it significant that <Emphasis type=\"i\">even the Wife\u2019s experts</Emphasis> had suggested that the net asset valuation method was the appropriate method of valuing BSPL\u2019s shares. It is relevant, in determining the value of BSPL as at 31\u00a0December 2010, to have regard to the undisputed fact that BSPL no longer had any business as at the date of the ancillary matters hearing. Utilising the going concern valuation methodology may result in the Wife being overcompensated inasmuch as she would obtain a share of BSPL based on an assumption that it would continue to have business, <Emphasis type=\"i\">even though</Emphasis> the parties accept that BSPL is no longer operating as a going concern. Hence, we find the net asset valuation method the more appropriate methodology that should be employed in determining the value of BSPL\u2019s share <Emphasis type=\"i\">in the context of this case</Emphasis>. Such an approach would also eliminate the uncertainties in the valuation resulting from the assumptions made by ROC in its report dated 6 August 2014.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"54\" pID=\"p1_54\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In all the circumstances, we find that it would be appropriate to value BSPL based on its net asset value as at 31\u00a0December 2010 with adjustments made to account for the market value of the Admiralty Street property. In this connection, we find that the appropriate valuation report that ought to be referred to is the Strix report which valued BSPL at $830,849 (see above at [45]). We note that this is also the amount which counsel for the Husband had stated during the oral hearing before us that the Husband was prepared to accept as the value of BSPL\u2019s shares.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Issue\u00a02: The valuation of the shares of BPL</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"55\" pID=\"p1_55\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The next issue concerns the Wife\u2019s appeal against the Judge\u2019s valuation of BPL\u2019s shares. Again, various valuation reports were prepared in this regard by the parties\u2019 respective experts. There are two reports which are relevant to the present appeal. The first is a report on BPL dated 21\u00a0April 2015 prepared by ROC, the Husband\u2019s expert. In this report, ROC opined that the fair value of BPL\u2019s shares was $152,928. The second is a report prepared by Strix dated 29\u00a0April 2015. In this report, Strix pointed out certain questionable transactions in BPL\u2019s financial statements, for which neither ROC nor the Husband had provided suitable explanations. In these circumstances, Strix valued the shares of BPL between $152,928 (adopting the value put forth by the ROC report) and $1,622,603, taking into account the amounts involved in the questionable transactions. In valuing BPL, the Judge adopted the lowest common denominator between the two reports, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, $152,928, while also treating the matter \u201cas one where there was some lack of full and frank disclosure\u201d which she held would be relevant in her decision on the just and equitable division to award each party (see the GD at [32]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"56\" pID=\"p1_56\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Wife submits that the Judge had erred on two counts. First, despite indicating the need to take the Husband\u2019s lack of full and frank disclosure concerning the accounts of BPL into account, the Judge had failed to do so. Second, the Judge ought not to have adopted ROC\u2019s valuation of BPL at $152,928 in circumstances where she had indicated that ROC\u2019s report was not as accurate as that of Strix.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"57\" pID=\"p1_57\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In our view, the Wife\u2019s submissions are not sustainable once the full context of the Judge\u2019s decision is examined. It is clear that the Judge <Emphasis type=\"i\">did</Emphasis> take into account the Husband\u2019s lack of full and frank disclosure in arriving at the just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets: see the GD at [50]. The fact also remains that the valuation of $152,928 was a sum that was advanced by <Emphasis type=\"i\">both</Emphasis> ROC <Emphasis type=\"i\">and</Emphasis> Strix. It was eminently open to Strix, in the circumstances, to reject ROC\u2019s valuation of BPL\u2019s shares at $152,928. However, not only did Strix not do so, Strix in fact advanced the same sum as a possible value of BPL\u2019s shares. In these circumstances, we are of the view that the Judge was fully justified in arriving at her decision to value the shares of BPL at $152,928, a value suggested by both parties\u2019 experts, and in taking into account any lack of full and frank disclosure in determining the just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets, which she in fact did. We therefore reject the Wife\u2019s submissions and affirm the Judge\u2019s decision to value BPL\u2019s shares at $152,928.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\"

60% of the Major Assets (as opposed to the 30% awarded by the Judge). In this regard, the Wife raises the following points on appeal:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_59-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge had erred in failing to translate her finding that the Wife had made \u201csubstantial\u201d contributions to the companies to her final award of division.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_59-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge was overly and unduly influenced by the Wife\u2019s lack of direct financial contribution to the companies.

The Wife must demonstrate that the Judge had erred in law, had clearly exercised her discretion wrongly, had taken into account irrelevant considerations, or had failed to take into account relevant considerations: see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Koh Bee Choo</Emphasis> at [46] and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Yeo Chong Lin</Emphasis> at [80].</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"61\" pID=\"p1_61\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In our view, the first two grounds raised by the Wife at [59] above are not sufficient to warrant appellate intervention in the decision on division. It is clear from the GD that the Judge was cognisant of the Wife\u2019s contributions to the business of the relevant companies. In this regard, we agree with the Judge that a spouse\u2019s contributions in work and effort towards increasing the value of a matrimonial asset (such as the value of shares in the company) may properly be regarded as direct contributions under s\u00a0112(2)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>) of the Act, which states that the court may have regard to \u201cthe extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or <Emphasis type=\"i\">work</Emphasis> towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets\u201d [emphasis added]. In fact, the Judge considered the Wife\u2019s direct contributions to increasing the value of the companies significant; she highlighted this point no fewer than four times in the GD (at [40]\u2013[41], [43] and [50]), as follows:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">40 \u2026 The Wife\u2019s contributions were in the form of <Emphasis type=\"bi\">her substantial efforts in improving the businesses and hence the value of the assets.</Emphasis> \u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">41 \u2026 [O]n the evidence available before me, I accepted that the Wife had <Emphasis type=\"bi\">contributed substantively towards the remarkable growth of the companies</Emphasis>.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">43 \u2026 On the whole, I found that the Wife had <Emphasis type=\"i\">clearly contributed by her efforts to </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">the substantial improvement</Emphasis> of APL. \u2026 The parties treated the companies as a group such that the Wife\u2019s efforts in improving APL also had an impact on the other companies.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">50 I noted that the Wife put in <Emphasis type=\"bi\">rather substantial efforts</Emphasis> towards improving in particular APL and BSPL and that the parties treated the companies as a group, moving finances between companies to fund the necessary. Her efforts were <Emphasis type=\"i\">most substantial</Emphasis> in the two businesses which made up 96 percent of the total value of the business to be divided \u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"62\" pID=\"p1_62\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the light of the above passages, the Wife\u2019s argument that the Judge failed to properly consider the extent of the Wife\u2019s contributions to the business success of the companies is unpersuasive. In fact, the following paragraph extracted from the Wife\u2019s written submissions is telling:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In fairness to the [Judge], she was fully cognizant of [the Wife\u2019s] \u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">substantial</Emphasis>\u201d contributions to the companies as she referred to them more than once in the GD. The criticism (respectfully) we make is that the [Judge] somehow failed to <Emphasis type=\"i\">translate</Emphasis> this recognition of [the Wife\u2019s] \u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">substantial</Emphasis>\u201d efforts in her final award. When one reads the GD, the overall tenor is that [the Judge] was clearly impressed with [the Wife\u2019s] efforts. Yet, when it came to the award, the proportion awarded to [the Wife] somehow did not appear to gel with her finding of [the Wife\u2019s] substantial contributions in the earlier parts of the GD. Put simply, there (respectfully) appears to be a disconnect between the 2 and one is left wondering how the 30% was arrived at. [emphasis in original]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"63\" pID=\"p1_63\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Evidently, the Wife admits that the Judge had properly considered the Wife\u2019s contributions to the companies. The essence of her submission is a <Emphasis type=\"i\">complaint</Emphasis> that, <Emphasis type=\"i\">in her personal opinion</Emphasis>, the division that the Judge arrived at was \u201cdisconnected\u201d from the Judge\u2019s finding of the Wife\u2019s substantial contributions to the companies. However, the Wife\u2019s <Emphasis type=\"i\">personal (and subjective) discontent</Emphasis> with the percentage eventually awarded is <Emphasis type=\"i\">not a ground for appellate intervention</Emphasis>. Instead, an appellate court is concerned to ensure that a judge has exercised his or her discretion objectively and within proper legal boundaries.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"64\" pID=\"p1_64\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Wife also argues that the Judge was unduly influenced by the fact that the Wife had made no direct <Emphasis type=\"i\">financial</Emphasis> contributions to the companies. She highlights that the Husband himself had made no direct financial contributions to the companies, at least in their initial stages. However, the evidence that the Wife relied on in her submissions related only to <Emphasis type=\"i\">one</Emphasis> company, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, APL. We are therefore unable to accept the Wife\u2019s assertions that the Husband did not contribute financially to the rest of the companies as there was no objective basis to do so. We note that the relevant companies, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, APL, BPL, BSPL and CPL, were all incorporated <Emphasis type=\"i\">prior</Emphasis> to the parties\u2019 marriage. Significantly, BPL was incorporated in 2000, six years before the parties\u2019 marriage. In such circumstances, it is difficult, in the absence of objective evidence, to accept the Wife\u2019s bare assertions that the Husband had not contributed to the various companies financially. In any event, we disagree with the Wife\u2019s submission that the Judge was <Emphasis type=\"i\">unduly</Emphasis> influenced by the lack of any direct financial contributions on the Wife\u2019s part to the companies. Again, this was but one consideration, out of an entire matrix of factors, that the Judge had regard to in arriving at her decision.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"65\" pID=\"p1_65\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In assessing the appropriate division, the Judge found that the Wife had <Emphasis type=\"i\">diverted</Emphasis> some of BSPL\u2019s businesses to other companies. It would seem that the Judge weighed this finding against the Wife and awarded her a lower percentage of the matrimonial assets in the light of that finding.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"66\" pID=\"p1_66\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">With great respect, we find that the Judge had erred in doing so. We do not think that the Judge had sufficient material before her upon which she could arrive at a finding that the Wife had <Emphasis type=\"i\">diverted</Emphasis> BSPL\u2019s businesses to companies owned or controlled by her. It must be borne in mind that a finding that business has been <Emphasis type=\"i\">diverted</Emphasis> from BSPL involves the necessary premise that such business originally belonged to BSPL. The Judge stated at [49] of the GD that she drew support for her conclusion from the decision of DJ\u00a0Wong in SUM\u00a0[A]. However, DJ\u00a0Wong did <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> make an express finding that the Wife had <Emphasis type=\"i\">diverted</Emphasis> BSPL\u2019s business. Instead, DJ Wong\u2019s finding was confined to whether the Wife had misrepresented the state of her financial resources. DJ\u00a0Wong held that the Wife had concealed her business ventures and gave the impression that she could not earn an income. However, he stopped short of making an express finding that the business ventures which the Wife was involved in had, in fact, been <Emphasis type=\"i\">diverted</Emphasis> from BSPL to companies which she had an interest in. Even accepting, for the moment, that some diversion of BSPL\u2019s business had occurred, it is difficult to ascertain from the evidence the <Emphasis type=\"i\">extent</Emphasis> of such diversion. With respect, absent clear evidence to this effect, the court ought not to engage in an exercise of speculation.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"67\" pID=\"p1_67\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Furthermore, the court dealing with the issue of ancillary matters is not the appropriate forum, generally speaking, to adjudicate on the issue as to whether the Wife had wrongfully diverted BSPL\u2019s business. If BSPL indeed believes that the Wife had committed a legal wrong against it, it is open to BSPL to commence an action against the Wife. The court would then be in an appropriate position to pronounce on the respective rights and obligations of either party after hearing the relevant evidence and submissions pertinent to the specific issue in dispute. In this connection, we note that this was in fact a course of action adopted by BSPL in Suit\u00a0[B], at least in relation to one specific corporate opportunity, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the loss of BSPL\u2019s opportunity to supply mashed potato machines to 7-Eleven. In our view, it would not be appropriate for the court dealing with ancillary matters to make a finding concerning the issue of diversion, which finding may, in fact, prejudice <Emphasis type=\"i\">on-going</Emphasis> or <Emphasis type=\"i\">potential</Emphasis> proceedings between BSPL and the Wife or her related companies. Indeed, this was also the position taken by the Husband in the proceedings below with respect to Suit\u00a0[B].</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"68\" pID=\"p1_68\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the premises, we vary the Judge\u2019s order and award a division of 65:35 of the Major Assets, in favour of the Husband. We are satisfied that this is a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets in the circumstances of the present case. We take into account the Wife\u2019s substantial contributions to the business of the Major Assets and the Husband\u2019s lack of full and frank disclosure of BPL\u2019s accounts. We also note that the exercise in relation to the division of matrimonial assets is performed only in relation to the Major Assets, and that the parties were allowed to keep the rest of their assets in their own name. In effect, this exercise seeks to apportion the value of the Major Assets (which are all in the <Emphasis type=\"i\">Husband\u2019s</Emphasis> name). In other words, the Wife stands <Emphasis type=\"i\">only to gain</Emphasis> from the division exercise as the assets in her name are shielded from division. Furthermore, although we have refrained from making a finding that the Wife had diverted business from BSPL, it appears clear from the evidence and the findings of DJ\u00a0Wong that the Wife has various business interests which she has failed to disclose. We therefore draw an adverse inference against the Wife for her failure to disclose these assets, which, as the Husband argued, <Emphasis type=\"i\">prima facie</Emphasis> fall within the pool of matrimonial assets. The effect of such an adverse inference, in the context of the present case, is that a lower percentage of the Major Assets is awarded to the Wife compared to that which we would otherwise have awarded to her (though in the light of the Husband\u2019s non-disclosures, only a small adjustment is made). Finally, it must be borne in mind that the parties were in a <Emphasis type=\"i\">marriage</Emphasis>, and not merely a <Emphasis type=\"i\">commercial</Emphasis> or <Emphasis type=\"i\">business</Emphasis> relationship. Whilst the short and childless nature of the marriage meant that greater weight would be placed on the direct contributions of the parties to the matrimonial assets, this is not to state that the parties\u2019 indirect contributions to the welfare of the family would be entirely disregarded in the assessment of division. It would be inappropriate to slice and dice the weight and appropriate ratio that <Emphasis type=\"i\">each and every</Emphasis> factor ought to be given in the exercise of division, as the Wife seeks to do. As this court stated in <Emphasis type=\"i\">NK\u00a0v\u00a0NL</Emphasis> [2007] 3\u00a0SLR(R) 743 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">NK\u00a0v\u00a0NL</Emphasis>\u201d) at [36], the division of matrimonial assets is \u201cnot a mechanistic accounting procedure reflected in the form of an arid and bloodless balance sheet\u201d. Indeed, the division of matrimonial property is not \u2013 and cannot be \u2013 a precise mathematical exercise. The focus is on achieving a <Emphasis type=\"i\">just and equitable</Emphasis> division. In this connection, we are satisfied that both the Husband and the Wife have made substantial contributions to the welfare of the family. In particular, we are satisfied that the Husband has made not insubstantial contributions to the welfare of Q.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"69\" pID=\"p1_69\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We conclude the analysis by observing that although the structured approach set out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ\u00a0v\u00a0ANK</Emphasis> [2015] 4\u00a0SLR 1043 has not been applied by the Judge or the parties in the present case, we are satisfied that the division which we have arrived at gives due regard to the parties\u2019 respective direct and indirect contributions, and that neither party has been over-compensated or under-compensated as a result.

First, nominal maintenance is not awarded <Emphasis type=\"i\">automatically</Emphasis> or <Emphasis type=\"i\">as a matter of course</Emphasis>. Second, the court will not award nominal maintenance merely based on a wife\u2019s assertion, without more, that her situation will change in the future. Third, the court in deciding whether to award nominal maintenance must always bear in mind the underlying rationale and purpose of an award of maintenance to former wives. In relation to the final principle, we made the following observations (at [31]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">31 \u2026 As this court stated in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Foo Ah Yan\u00a0v\u00a0Chiam Heng Chow</Emphasis>\u00a0[2012] 2\u00a0SLR 506\u00a0(\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Foo Ah Yan</Emphasis>\u201d), the overarching principle embodied in s\u00a0114(2) is that of financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage \u2013 but we also cautioned that s\u00a0114(2) had to be applied in a \u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">commonsense holistic manner</Emphasis> that takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of marriage\u201d (at [13] and [16]; emphasis in original). In this regard, some elaboration may be apposite. As this court (adopting the views of Prof\u00a0Leong) has emphasised in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Foo Ah Yan</Emphasis> at [22] and [26]:</Text>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the duty of a husband to maintain his wife during the marriage, as provided by s\u00a069(1) of the Act, and the obligation to provide maintenance to a former wife under s\u00a0113 of the Act are\u00a0<Emphasis type=\"bi\">driven by separate forces</Emphasis>. As Prof\u00a0Leong Wai Kum pointed out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Elements of Family Law in Singapore</Emphasis>\u00a0[(LexisNexis, 2007)] at p\u00a0476:</Text>\n            <Quote level=\"3\">\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the former situation, the objective is to provide modest maintenance, namely, to help her overcome her immediate financial need which may well be the same objective when ordering maintenance for a dependent child. In the latter situation, maintenance ordered for a former wife, however, serves the far more ambitious objective of giving her a fair share of the surplus wealth that had been acquired by the spouses during the subsistence of the marriage.</Text>\n            </Quote>\n          </Quote>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Indeed, while the court must have regard to all circumstances of the case when ordering maintenance in both contexts, the matters that the Act specifically directs the court to consider under ss\u00a069(4) and 114 of the Act are not identical.

This is, as we observed in a different context in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ATE\u00a0v\u00a0ATD</Emphasis>, wholly contrary to the very purpose of awarding maintenance to a former wife in the first place.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"73\" pID=\"p1_73\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In fact, the Wife\u2019s stated reasons in her submissions for seeking an order of interim maintenance is to serve as \u201ca useful Sword of Damocles to keep [the Husband] in check against filing frivolous actions against [the Wife]\u201d. It is wholly unmeritorious for the Wife to seek an order of nominal maintenance on this basis. Inasmuch as the Wife\u2019s complaint is that the Husband has commenced legal actions against her which are without merit, frivolous and vexatious, the appropriate way for such issues to be addressed is by applying to strike out the Husband\u2019s claims or by seeking an order of indemnity costs against the Husband. The purpose of an order of maintenance is <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> to place a sword of Damocles over the Husband\u2019s head, but to ensure that the Wife achieves financial preservation.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"74\" pID=\"p1_74\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In this connection, we are satisfied that the amount awarded as interim maintenance, amounting to $416,000, is more than a fair and reasonable amount to be awarded to the Wife as maintenance.

The Wife worked during the course of the marriage, and is, by all accounts, a determined and capable businesswoman. Prior to her marriage to the Husband, she operated five hair and beauty centres and three foot reflexology businesses. The revenue of these businesses was $719,436 in 2003.

Both the Husband and Wife appealed against the order. The appeals came before Woo Bih Li\u00a0J who dismissed the Husband\u2019s appeal but allowed the Wife\u2019s appeal, bringing forward the starting time when the Husband became liable for interim maintenance from 1\u00a0December 2011 to 1\u00a0May 2011.

Section\u00a070 was first introduced <Emphasis type=\"i\">via</Emphasis> the Women\u2019s Charter (Amendment) Act (No\u00a026 of 1980). It was based upon s\u00a099 of the Malaysian Law Reform (Marriages and Divorce) Act 1976 (\u201cthe Malaysian Act\u201d) (see the <Emphasis type=\"i\">Comparative Table</Emphasis> to the Women\u2019s Charter (Amendment) Bill (Bill No\u00a023/79) (\u201cthe Bill\u201d) (and, in so far as the general background to the Malaysian Act is concerned, see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Report of the Royal Commission on Non-Muslim Marriage and Divorce Laws</Emphasis> (Kuala Lumpur, 1971) (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Report on the Malaysian Act</Emphasis>\u201d))). Section\u00a099 of the Malaysian Act is <Emphasis type=\"i\">almost</Emphasis> identical to s\u00a070 with <Emphasis type=\"i\">one crucial difference</Emphasis> in that s\u00a099 of the Malaysian Act applies only to a situation where <Emphasis type=\"i\">a man</Emphasis> has accepted a child who is not his child as a member of his family. Originally, the proposed section, like s\u00a099 of the Malaysian Act, applied only to \u201ca man\u201d (see s\u00a0127 introduced <Emphasis type=\"i\">via</Emphasis> cl\u00a017 of the Bill). The provision was however later amended to substitute \u201cman\u201d with \u201cperson\u201d after the Select Committee on the Bill accepted Prof\u00a0Leong Wai Kum\u2019s recommendation that if the policy behind the section was that a person who had accepted a child to be a member of his or her family should help in maintaining the child, there was then \u201cno basis for distinguishing between a man and a woman who is capable of bearing the financial responsibility\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Report of the Select Committee on the Women\u2019s Charter (Amendment) Bill (Bill No\u00a023/79)</Emphasis> (Parl\u00a01 of 1980, 25\u00a0June 1980) at pp\u00a07, A\u00a014 and C\u00a020).

Essentially, Woo\u00a0J held that s\u00a0127 stipulates the power of the court, but the exercise of the power in s\u00a0127 had to be premised on a duty to maintain (at [15]). A biological parent\u2019s duty to maintain a child is provided for under s\u00a068 of the Act, while a <Emphasis type=\"i\">non</Emphasis>-biological parent\u2019s duty to maintain a child is provided for under s\u00a070.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"86\" pID=\"p1_86\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This is an approach that we agree with.

This includes the substantive obligation of non-parents to maintain children accepted as a member of the family set out under s\u00a070.

First, the child must be \u201caccepted \u2026 as a member of his family\u201d.

We refer to two cases to illustrate this point. In the English High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">B\u00a0v\u00a0B and F</Emphasis> [1968] 3\u00a0WLR 1217 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">B\u00a0v\u00a0B</Emphasis>\u201d), a wife left her husband, taking all six children with her. The husband believed all six children to be his. However, it was later discovered that he was not the father of the two youngest children. Subsequently, the husband applied for an order that he should have access to the two youngest children, arguing that he had accepted them as children of the family. Stirling\u00a0J held that this required the non-parent to show, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, that (a)\u00a0he had full knowledge of the material facts (<Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, acceptance of a <Emphasis type=\"i\">non-biological</Emphasis> child), and (b)\u00a0an unequivocal mutual agreement between the spouses of the family, whether by conduct or otherwise, that the child should be accepted into the family. The court held that the non-parent had failed to satisfy these requirements, and accordingly, the court was unable to grant the non-parent access to the children under the 1965\u00a0UK Act. In another English High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">P\u00a0v\u00a0P</Emphasis> [1969] 1\u00a0WLR 898 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">P\u00a0v\u00a0P</Emphasis>\u201d), the wife had three children from previous relationships when she married the husband. She, however, misrepresented to the husband that the three children were of her partner from a prior marriage, and that her previous partner had been killed in an accident. After the parties\u2019 marriage, the husband sought to accept the children into the family, meeting resistance from the wife, who did not intend the husband to have control over her children. Later, the parties separated, and the children sought maintenance from the husband. As the wife had never agreed to the children being accepted as children of the family, the husband could not be held responsible for their maintenance (at 902\u2013903).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"94\" pID=\"p1_94\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In <Emphasis type=\"i\">Family Law: Report on Financial Provisions in Matrimonial Proceedings</Emphasis> (Law Com No\u00a025) (24\u00a0July 1969), the Law Commission of England and Wales (\u201cthe Law Commission\u201d) expressed its dissatisfaction with the above position in the following terms (at p\u00a013, para\u00a028):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">One of the things that we find disturbing about some of these decisions is that <Emphasis type=\"i\">they look at the question solely from the point of view of the spouse and not at all from that of the child whose interests are equally important and, perhaps, paramount</Emphasis>. It may be hard for a cuckolded husband to have to continue to bear a responsibility which he has assumed in ignorance of some of the relevant facts. But his ignorance is not the fault of the child but of the wife whom he took on for better or worse, and the hardship to the child of being deprived of support is even greater. Moreover, how far will the courts be prepared to go in saying that acceptance involves knowledge of material facts? A mistaken belief that one is the parent is clearly highly material, but is it the only material factor? Suppose the husband accepts the child in the belief that it is the child of his brother, whereas in fact it is the child of a stranger of a different race, religion and colour? Many people would regard this as an equally fundamental mistake. Yet surely the mistaken beliefs of the husband, though they may be relevant in determining his position vis-\u00e0-vis the wife, should not determine his position vis-\u00e0-vis the child, or, more especially, operate to exclude for all purposes the child from being a child of the family.

In this case, shortly after the parties had gotten married, they separated and the husband and wife lived completely separate lives. The wife became pregnant by another man. She visited the husband with the baby after she had given birth, and the husband\u2019s mother assumed that the husband was the father of the child. The husband did not repudiate this and also allowed the wife\u2019s family to think that it was his child. Thereafter, the parties continued their separate lives, although the husband would occasionally visit the mother and child and buy gifts, signing off as \u201cDad\u201d. On these facts, the judge held that the husband had treated the child as a member of the family. This was reversed on appeal. The English Court of Appeal held that, firstly, the parties only constituted a family during the short time before they had separated. It was thus not possible for the child to be treated as a member of the <Emphasis type=\"i\">family</Emphasis> as there was no relevant family to speak of. Secondly, it was held that the evidence only went far enough to demonstrate that the husband took part in the pretence without protest, but that this did not amount to treating the child as a child of the family. In particular, Ormord\u00a0LJ stated that the test was to be applied broadly (at 45):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026 People try to preserve reasonably good human relationships with one another without guarding their legal position with meticulous care.

It is really a great mistake and clearly contrary to the whole meaning of the legislation to create such an artificial and legalistic situation in such a sensitive area of family life. I think the court should look at this question of \u201ctreating a child as a child of the family\u201d broadly and answer it broadly as far as possible, trying to reach the sort of conclusion that any ordinary sensible citizen would reach when asked the question. \u2026</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"99\" pID=\"p1_99\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the English Court of Appeal decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">D\u00a0v\u00a0D (child of the family)</Emphasis> [1981] 2\u00a0FLR 93 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">D\u00a0v\u00a0D</Emphasis>\u201d), the mother of a child re-married. She sought maintenance of the child from her husband, the child\u2019s step-father. It was found that the child generally lived in her grandparents\u2019 house, though she would occasionally stay with her mother and step-father when she felt like it. A room was kept for her at her mother\u2019s home where her belongings were kept. The step-father bought a pony for the child and expected her to groom and clean it. He would also reprove her if she failed to keep her room tidy. During certain years, the step-father had also claimed child relief as an allowance in his taxable income. On these facts, the judge found that the child had been treated as a child of the family. The step-father appealed, and the appeal was unanimously allowed by the court. In the main, the court considered that the facts did not show that the step-father had treated the child anything more than <Emphasis type=\"i\">his wife\u2019s</Emphasis> child.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"100\" pID=\"p1_100\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The comments made by the court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">D\u00a0v\u00a0D</Emphasis> are significant.

This included factors such as where the child lives, who pays for the child, who exercises discipline over the child, and whether the step-father had in fact exercised, or claimed any responsibilities of a parent. He held that he was unable, on the facts, to \u201cdraw the inference that [the step-father] accepted the responsibility of a parent\u201d, and held that there was \u201cnothing to show that [the step-father and wife] <Emphasis type=\"i\">jointly</Emphasis> \u2026 <Emphasis type=\"i\">assumed</Emphasis> the responsibility and <Emphasis type=\"i\">exercised</Emphasis> the responsibility of parents of the child\u201d [emphasis added] (at 98).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"101\" pID=\"p1_101\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Given the differences in the legislative structure and language, the English position is not fully applicable in the Singapore context. That being said, there are nevertheless useful lessons that may be gleaned from the English position (particularly with regard to English case law dealing with the prior legal position which (like s\u00a070) centred (only) on the concept of \u201cacceptance\u201d), which we elaborate on in the following sections.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Whether a child has been accepted as a member of the non-parent\u2019s family</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"102\" pID=\"p1_102\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Prof\u00a0Leong opines in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Family Law</Emphasis> that the basis of a non-parent\u2019s duty to maintain a child rests in the non-parent\u2019s <Emphasis type=\"i\">voluntary assumption of responsibility</Emphasis> for the child\u2019s maintenance (at p\u00a0417). Indeed, the same concept of assumption of responsibility finds legislative expression in both the 1965\u00a0UK Act and the 1973\u00a0UK Act as a factor which the court is tasked to take into account when ordering maintenance against a non-parent (see above at [92] and [97]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"103\" pID=\"p1_103\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In our view, the concept of \u201cacceptance\u201d as part of one\u2019s family embodies, but <Emphasis type=\"i\">also</Emphasis> entails <Emphasis type=\"i\">more</Emphasis> than, the voluntary assumption of responsibility for the child\u2019s maintenance; it is the voluntary assumption of <Emphasis type=\"i\">parental</Emphasis> responsibility that is crucial. In this regard, we agree with Templeman\u00a0LJ\u2019s salutary observations in <Emphasis type=\"i\">D\u00a0v\u00a0D</Emphasis> that the question is whether the non-parent had accepted <Emphasis type=\"i\">parental responsibilities</Emphasis>. This is ultimately a question of <Emphasis type=\"i\">fact</Emphasis>, taking into account all the relevant circumstances and context before the court itself (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Bowlas v Bowlas</Emphasis> [1965] 3\u00a0WLR 593 at 597 and 601 and the English High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">R\u00a0v\u00a0R</Emphasis> [1968] P\u00a0414 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">R\u00a0v\u00a0R</Emphasis>\u201d) at 417). The inquiry ought also, in our view, to be an <Emphasis type=\"i\">objective</Emphasis> one inasmuch as it is premised on a consideration of all the objective evidence before the court (see also the English Court of Appeal decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Snow v Snow</Emphasis> [1971] 3\u00a0WLR 230 at 245, <Emphasis type=\"i\">per</Emphasis> Bagnall\u00a0J). Thus, the court\u2019s task is to identify indicia which demonstrate, on the objective facts, that the non-parent had voluntarily taken on <Emphasis type=\"i\">parental</Emphasis> responsibility for the child\u2019s welfare. Statements by a non-parent during proceedings that he or she did not accept the child as a member of his or her family would be tested against the objective evidence. Strong indicators of acceptance into the family would include the changing of the child\u2019s surname to that of the non-parent, or whether the child has been encouraged to address the non-parent in parental terms, such as \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d and \u201cmum\u201d. It bears emphasising that the court ought not to, in assessing the facts, engage in too technical or legalistic an approach that might in fact undermine the very <Emphasis type=\"i\">raision d\u2019\u00eatre</Emphasis> of the statutory provision itself. In an area as sensitive as determining the relationship between a non-parent and a child, the question must at all times be decided with reference to the conclusion an \u201cordinary sensible citizen\u201d (borrowing the words of Ormord\u00a0LJ in <Emphasis type=\"i\">M\u00a0v\u00a0M</Emphasis>) would reach when asked the question.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"104\" pID=\"p1_104\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Whether or not a person can be held to have accepted a child within the meaning of s\u00a070(1) can be derived either from an express declaration or arrangement on the one hand, or by an inference from that person\u2019s conduct <Emphasis type=\"i\">vis-\u00e0-vis</Emphasis> the child concerned on the other. The former is, of course, a form of the latter, albeit, in the nature of things, constituting the clearest form of conduct possible. In so far, however, as the latter is concerned, whether such conduct demonstrates that a person has accepted a child as a member of his or her family would depend on the precise facts and circumstances concerned.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"105\" pID=\"p1_105\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Prof\u00a0Leong states in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Family Law</Emphasis> (at p\u00a0417) that \u201c[s]omeone who marries a parent will readily be found to have voluntarily assumed responsibility to provide reasonable maintenance to her spouse\u2019s child\u201d. This was also the position taken by Ormrod\u00a0J (as he then was) in the English High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Kirkwood v Kirkwood</Emphasis> [1970] 1\u00a0WLR 1042 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Kirkwood v Kirkwood</Emphasis>\u201d) at 1046 (see the quotation set out below at [107]). We see the force in such an approach. Indeed, it has been recognised both statutorily and in case law that \u201cmarriage [is] an equal co-operative partnership of efforts\u201d (see the decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">NK\u00a0v\u00a0NL</Emphasis> at [20] as well as s\u00a046(1) of the Act). Such effort would, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, include efforts by <Emphasis type=\"i\">both parties</Emphasis> to bring up the children of one party to the marriage. However, this is not to say that in <Emphasis type=\"i\">all</Emphasis> cases, a step-parent will be found to have accepted a step-child as a member of his or her family. Everything will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, although in such cases, acceptance would be more easily established.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"106\" pID=\"p1_106\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">There are also important lessons to be gleaned from the English experience in the interpretation of the concept of \u201cacceptance\u201d. In particular, the question arises, as a matter of Singapore law, the extent to which the two factors of (a)\u00a0knowledge of the full facts and (b)\u00a0an unequivocal agreement between both spouses to accept the child, apply as factors in the inquiry as to acceptance. As these two factors are not relevant to the present appeals, we express, only briefly, our <Emphasis type=\"i\">provisional</Emphasis> views on these two matters. Whilst we think that these two factors may be <Emphasis type=\"i\">relevant</Emphasis> to the inquiry as to acceptance, they ought not to be <Emphasis type=\"i\">necessary conditions</Emphasis> to be satisfied before it may be held that the non-parent has \u201caccepted\u201d the child as a part of his or her family.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"107\" pID=\"p1_107\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We do <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> think that a non-parent may <Emphasis type=\"i\">only</Emphasis> be found to accept a child as a member of his or her family on the basis of a full understanding of the facts (though <Emphasis type=\"i\">cf R\u00a0v\u00a0R</Emphasis>, especially at 417 as well as <Emphasis type=\"i\">per</Emphasis> Lord\u00a0Denning\u00a0MR in the English Court of Appeal decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">In re\u00a0L (an infant)</Emphasis> [1967] 3\u00a0WLR 1645 at 1652\u22121653). In our view, under s\u00a070, the <Emphasis type=\"i\">paramount</Emphasis> consideration centres on the <Emphasis type=\"i\">interests of the child</Emphasis>. There is force in the Law Commission\u2019s views (above at [94]) that the extent of any non-disclosure ought not to affect the court\u2019s view of the relationship between the non-parent and the child. Provisionally, we think that the appropriate focus under s\u00a070 is <Emphasis type=\"i\">the quality of the relationship</Emphasis> between the non-parent and the child. Hence, if the non-parent had assumed parental responsibility on the basis of facts which later turned out to be false, this should not be a bar to a court finding that the non-parent had accepted the child as a member of his or her family. An illustration in this regard may be found in the case of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Kirkwood v Kirkwood</Emphasis> where the husband concerned claimed that he had not \u201caccepted\u201d the two children of the wife by her previous marriage. In particular, he claimed that he had not been aware that the children were illegitimate (and were not the children of the wife\u2019s first husband, as she had claimed). Ormrod\u00a0J rejected the husband\u2019s argument and observed as follows (at 1045\u22121046):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The provisions in the Matrimonial Proceedings (Magistrates\u2019 Courts) Act, 1960, and the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1965, of a corresponding nature [both of which originated in s\u00a01 of the 1958 UK Act], are clearly designed primarily for the protection of children who are in this position of being children of one spouse and not of the other; and if this court were to lay down that acceptance involves something approaching a contractual arrangement so that it would be vitiated by non-disclosure or something of that kind, we might be driving a very large wedge into this statutory provision, because the facts here are that the husband accepted two children of his future wife, and in that respect it differs, I think, from cases like <Emphasis type=\"i\">R.</Emphasis>\u00a0v.\u00a0<Emphasis type=\"i\">R.</Emphasis> [1968] P.\u00a0414, in which the basis of the case had been that the husband did not know at the time that the child or children were not his, and therefore he accepted the children believing them to be his, and not questioning the matter, when in fact it turned out afterwards that they were not his at all\u2014so that his mind had never been directed to the question whether or not he was prepared to accept another man\u2019s child or children into the family.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This is not the situation in this case at all. The husband was perfectly prepared to accept these two children, the only question being whether the non-disclosure of the illegitimacy can affect their acceptance. In my judgment it cannot. Even if this disclosure might have seriously affected his mind in deciding to marry or not, the non-disclosure should not affect the question whether he had accepted the children in law. It would obviously be an inadequate ground to justify a court in interfering with the validity of the marriage. The courts in this country have always rigorously set their face against avoiding marriage on the ground of non-disclosure, except in the most extreme circumstances and with the most extremely thorough safeguards. This is to open a door which is an extremely dangerous one, and my own view is that it would be quite wrong to introduce this sort of concept into the question of acceptance of children as part of the family. It is necessary, of course, that the husband should know that they are not his children if he is to bring his mind to bear on this question at all; but where, as here, we have a marriage to a woman with two children, in my judgment, that is enough, prima facie, to establish acceptance by him.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"108\" pID=\"p1_108\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The observations made by Ormrod\u00a0J in the preceding paragraph are, in our view, equally applicable with the position under s\u00a070(1). This is also consistent with the need for the law to provide \u2013 as far as it is both possible as well as reasonable \u2013 for the welfare of children generally. What s\u00a070 attempts to do, in our view, is to <Emphasis type=\"i\">strike a balance</Emphasis> between achieving justice and fairness for the child on the one hand and for the non-parent on the other. We are also of the view that such an approach does not do violence to the concept of \u201cacceptance\u201d that represents the current legal position under Singapore law. Indeed, as already emphasised above (at [104] and [105]), everything depends on the precise facts and circumstances of the case. It is entirely conceivable that, in an <Emphasis type=\"i\">egregious</Emphasis> situation involving fraudulent conduct that impacts the knowledge of the non-parent concerned as well as the quality of the relationship between the non-parent and the child, the court may well find that there had been no acceptance by the non-parent of the child. It should be noted that the current position under Singapore law remains that of \u201cacceptance\u201d (rather than that of \u201ctreatment\u201d) which envisages that the acceptor\u2019s state of mind is a relevant factor in the inquiry. In this regard, we note too that it has been observed that the concept of \u201ctreatment\u201d posits a <Emphasis type=\"i\">more objective test</Emphasis> than the concept of \u201cacceptance\u201d: see the comments of Ormord\u00a0LJ in <Emphasis type=\"i\">D\u00a0v\u00a0D</Emphasis> at 96.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"109\" pID=\"p1_109\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the context of s\u00a070(1), which fixes the duty of maintenance generally on non-parents (and not divorcing <Emphasis type=\"i\">spouses per se</Emphasis>), we do not think it necessary to find an agreement or a mutuality of intention between both <Emphasis type=\"i\">spouses</Emphasis> before acceptance into the non-parent\u2019s family may be found on the facts. The crucial question to be answered is whether the non-parent in question (whether a step-parent, grandparent, relative or even stranger) interacted with the child as if he or she was the child\u2019s <Emphasis type=\"i\">parent</Emphasis>. However, if the natural parent of the child had evinced an intention that the child ought not to be accepted as a member of the non-parent\u2019s family, as was the case in <Emphasis type=\"i\">P\u00a0v\u00a0P</Emphasis>, this, in our view, would be a relevant matter in the inquiry as to whether or not there had been acceptance by the non-parent of the child concerned.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"110\" pID=\"p1_110\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Finally (and for the sake of completeness), there must \u2013 perhaps both logically as well as commonsensically \u2013 also be a family into which the child concerned can in fact be accepted (see, for example, <Emphasis type=\"i\">B\u00a0v\u00a0B</Emphasis> at 1221). However, the question, which we leave open to be considered in the appropriate case, is whether a \u201cfamily\u201d, for the purposes of s\u00a070(1), must be that of a two-parent family, or whether a \u201cfamily\u201d may comprise a unit consisting of <Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis> non-parent and a child alone.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Failure of parents to maintain the child</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"111\" pID=\"p1_111\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The second factor under s\u00a070(1) of the Act which must subsist before a non-parent\u2019s duty to maintain a child arises is the failure of the child\u2019s parents (whether biological or adoptive) to maintain the child. The presence of this condition is a recognition of the primacy of parental liability to a child. Evidently, the relationship between a biological parent and a child is special, in that it is a relationship created naturally without legal process. The relationship between adoptive parents and children also deserves a higher status as the process of adoption \u201cirrevocably severs the relationship between the biological parents and their child\u201d, replacing it simultaneously with a relationship between a new set of parents and a child (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Family Law</Emphasis> at p\u00a0379 and s\u00a07 of the Adoption of Children Act (Cap\u00a04, 2012 Rev Ed)). Parents are therefore in unique positions <Emphasis type=\"i\">vis-\u00e0-vis</Emphasis> a child. In this regard, we endorse the views of Assoc\u00a0Prof\u00a0Debbie Ong (as she then was) in \u201cFamily Law\u201d (2011) 12\u00a0SAL Ann Rev 298 (\u201c2011 <Emphasis type=\"i\">Family Law Review</Emphasis>\u201d) where she stated (at para\u00a015.6):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026 Parents stand in an exalted position with respect to having authority over the upbringing of their children.

In particular, the question arises as to whether it must be demonstrated that the child\u2019s biological parents lack the <Emphasis type=\"i\">financial means</Emphasis> to provide adequately for the child, <Emphasis type=\"bi\">or</Emphasis> whether it is sufficient to show that they, irrespective of their means, have <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> provided for the child. In the Singapore High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">AAE\u00a0v\u00a0AAF</Emphasis> [2009] 3\u00a0SLR(R) 827 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">AAE\u00a0v\u00a0AAF</Emphasis>\u201d), Belinda Ang Saw Ean\u00a0J adopted the former approach. She declined to require the non-parent to pay maintenance for the child where there was no evidence that the wife (the child\u2019s mother) would not be able to financially maintain the child. It is also pertinent to note that, in that case, the biological father of the child was still in a relationship with the wife. Ang\u00a0J was of the view that maintenance should first be sought from the biological parents. It thus appears that Ang\u00a0J\u2019s approach requires it to be demonstrated, presumably on a balance of probabilities, that the biological parents did not have the financial capability to maintain the child before an order against a non-parent would be made.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"113\" pID=\"p1_113\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The latter approach was adopted in <Emphasis type=\"i\">EB\u00a0v\u00a0EC</Emphasis>. In that case, it was accepted that the mother could not maintain the children, but the submission was made that maintenance should first have been sought from the children\u2019s biological father before an order was made against the non-parent. At the material time, the biological father was paying nominal maintenance for the children at $2 per month. Woo\u00a0J held that in such circumstances it could be said that the biological father had failed to maintain the children. Failure to maintain did not require a total failure, but a failure to <Emphasis type=\"i\">adequately</Emphasis> maintain the children (see also the Singapore High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">AJE\u00a0v\u00a0AJF</Emphasis> [2011] 3\u00a0SLR 1177 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">AJE\u00a0v\u00a0AJF</Emphasis>\u201d) at [11]\u2013[12]). Although the biological mother of the children had failed to obtain an order for substantive maintenance, Woo\u00a0J stated that this \u201c[did] not change the fact that [the children\u2019s biological father] too is not fully maintaining them\u201d (at [25]). Hence, it appeared that in Woo\u00a0J\u2019s view, there was no need to prove an inability to maintain if <Emphasis type=\"i\">in fact</Emphasis> there was <Emphasis type=\"i\">inadequate</Emphasis> maintenance. However, Woo\u00a0J was also of the view (at [28]) that the burden of maintenance ought not to be permanently imposed on the non-parent.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"114\" pID=\"p1_114\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of s\u00a070 is to safeguard the interests of the child, we find the approach taken in <Emphasis type=\"i\">EB\u00a0v\u00a0EC</Emphasis> more appropriate. Section\u00a070 is in place as a \u201cstop-gap measure to provide for a child with immediate needs\u201d (see 2011 <Emphasis type=\"i\">Family Law Review</Emphasis> at para\u00a015.6). It would be too onerous a burden if the applicant for maintenance is required to demonstrate that the child\u2019s parents, who may, in some cases, be missing or un-contactable, do not have the resources to provide for the child. A non-parent who has accepted the child as a member of his or her family will therefore have a duty to provide for the child\u2019s maintenance under s\u00a070(1) as long as it appears that <Emphasis type=\"i\">in fact</Emphasis> the child has not been adequately maintained by his or her parents, thereby safeguarding the child\u2019s welfare in ensuring that the child is at all times adequately provided for. This is not to say, however, that a non-parent would be unfairly fixed with liability for maintenance of a child if a child\u2019s parents are in fact fully capable of doing so, but wilfully refuse to maintain the child. This is because s\u00a070(3) of the Act (\u201cs\u00a070(3)\u201d) furnishes the non-parent an avenue to recover the sums expanded on the child from the biological parents.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"115\" pID=\"p1_115\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In <Emphasis type=\"i\">AJE\u00a0v\u00a0AJF</Emphasis>, Kan Ting Chiu\u00a0J identified difficult questions arising from the application of s\u00a070(3).

In <Emphasis type=\"i\">EB\u00a0v\u00a0EC</Emphasis> (at [20]), Woo\u00a0J quoted from Leong Wai Kum, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Principles of Family Law in Singapore</Emphasis> (Butterworths Asia, 1997) at p\u00a0861:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The underlying basis of this duty differs from that of a parent. A parent is, naturally, liable for his or her child\u2019s maintenance. The basis of a parent\u2019s duty lies, if one likes, in the decision to be a parent in the first place. The basis under section\u00a070(1), though, is the person voluntarily assuming this responsibility when he or she had a real choice whether to do so. By accepting the child as a member of his or her family, he or she has represented to the child that he or she accepts the duty of maintenance of the child. If the child\u2019s parents fail in it, the courts may enforce the responsibility which the adult had assumed. If the basis of the liability is a voluntary assumption of responsibility, it would appear that this responsibility cannot be enforced as resolutely as the duty of a parent. The duty is \u2026 subordinated to a parent\u2019s duty but, even without those express limits, it seems right in principle that the person cannot be forced to discharge this responsibility for a long time after he or she has clearly indicated that he or she no longer accepts it.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"121\" pID=\"p1_121\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Woo\u00a0J then noted (at [21]) that the above passage did <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> suggest an <Emphasis type=\"i\">immediate</Emphasis> cessation of responsibility as the phrase \u201cfor a long time\u201d was used. He opined that once a person had accepted a child as a member of the family, the person could not \u201cabandon the responsibility simply by changing his mind\u201d. Woo\u00a0J distinguished between the duty to maintain and the power to order maintenance (at [26]). On the facts, it was held that it would not be appropriate to impose the duty on the non-parent permanently by making an order of maintenance against him until the children were 21\u00a0years old. Instead, maintenance ought to be sought from the biological father. Notably, Woo\u00a0J also held that s\u00a070(2) of the Act was meant to cover the situation where the parent (who is not part of the family of the person who has accepted the child) takes the child away from the custody of the person who had accepted the child as a member of his family (at [19]). According to Woo\u00a0J, s\u00a070(2) of the Act would not apply to a situation where the biological parent takes the child away from the non-parent as a result of the breakdown of the marriage between the parent and the non-parent.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"122\" pID=\"p1_122\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We agree with the opinions of Woo\u00a0J and Kan\u00a0J in so far as they hold that where a non-parent has accepted a child as a member of his or her family, he or she may not thereafter renege on that acceptance by simply changing his or her mind. This is also supported by the Explanatory Statement to the Draft Bill of the Malaysian Act (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Report on the Malaysian Act</Emphasis> at p\u00a058), which states that s\u00a099 of that Act was intended to provide \u201cfor the maintenance of a child accepted by any person as a member of his family, <Emphasis type=\"i\">unless and until such child is taken away by its natural parent</Emphasis>\u201d [emphasis added]. What this suggests is that s\u00a099 (and s\u00a070, which is <Emphasis type=\"i\">in pari materia</Emphasis> to s\u00a099 of the Malaysian Act) was intended to impose maintenance obligations on a non-parent who had \u201caccepted\u201d the child <Emphasis type=\"i\">unless and until</Emphasis> the natural parent takes the child out of the non-parent\u2019s custody.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"123\" pID=\"p1_123\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Thus, where a child is taken away from the non-parent in the context of the breakdown of a marriage between the non-parent and the child\u2019s parent, this would, in our view, cause the non-parent\u2019s duty imposed by s\u00a070(1) to cease. In our view, the duty imposed by s\u00a070(1) on a non-parent would thus ordinarily cease when the interim judgment for divorce is granted. In the context of the division of matrimonial assets, we held in the case of <Emphasis type=\"i\">ARX\u00a0v\u00a0ARY</Emphasis> that the starting point or default position to determine the pool of matrimonial assets should be the date that the interim judgment is granted (at [31]). In this context, we observed (at [32]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a strong justification for this position as a matter of principle. The interim judgment \u201cputs an end to the marriage contract and indicates that the parties no longer intend to participate in the joint accumulation of matrimonial assets \u2026\u201d (<Emphasis type=\"i\">AJR\u00a0v\u00a0AJS</Emphasis>\u00a0[2010] 4\u00a0SLR 617\u00a0(\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">AJR</Emphasis>\u201d) at\u00a0[4]). The grant of interim judgment is a recognition by the court that there is \u201cno longer any matrimonial home, no <Emphasis type=\"i\">consortium vitae</Emphasis>\u00a0and no right on either side to conjugal rights\u201d (<Emphasis type=\"i\">Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy\u00a0v\u00a0Shanmugam Nagaiah</Emphasis> [1987] SLR(R)\u00a0702\u00a0at\u00a0[25]). The interim judgment \u201cput[s] an end to the whole content of the marriage contract, leaving only the shell, that is, the technical bond\u201d (<Emphasis type=\"i\">Fender\u00a0v\u00a0St\u00a0John-Mildmay</Emphasis> [1936] 1\u00a0KB 111\u00a0at 115\u2013117). In a general sense, it would be artificial to speak of any asset acquired <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> the interim judgment has been granted as being a matrimonial asset.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"124\" pID=\"p1_124\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the same way as an interim judgment for divorce puts the acquisition of matrimonial assets at an end, the interim judgment for divorce also puts an end to the parties\u2019 union and their shared interest in co-operating for the well-being of the family. Whilst a parent continues to have a duty to maintain his or her biological children under s\u00a068 of the Act whether or not such children are in the custody of that parent, a non-parent does not stand in the same position. In the usual case, the breakdown of a marriage would result in the non-parent losing custody of, and perhaps even access to, the child. It would not be fair to the non-parent to require him or her, in such circumstances, to continue maintaining the child.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"125\" pID=\"p1_125\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Having set out at some length the general principles, we now apply them to the facts of the present case.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Application of the law to the facts</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"126\" pID=\"p1_126\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We apply the law to the facts in two stages. First, we examine whether the Husband\u2019s duty to maintain Q under s\u00a070(1) has been triggered. Second, we consider whether, in the light of the divorce proceedings, the Husband\u2019s duty to maintain Q has ceased, and if so, whether the Husband ought to be awarded a refund of the interim maintenance paid to Q.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Whether the Husband\u2019s duty to maintain Q has been triggered</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"127\" pID=\"p1_127\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It appears that the only question reserved for the ancillary matters court is whether the Husband accepted Q as a member of his family (see above at [77]). This is also the issue around which the arguments have been centred. It thus appears to be accepted, at least during the period when the Husband was required to pay interim maintenance to Q, that Q\u2019s parents had failed to maintain her. In the premises, we only consider whether the Husband had accepted Q as a member of his family.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"128\" pID=\"p1_128\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As a preliminary point, we note that the Husband accepts that he was responsible for Q\u2019s maintenance during the course of the marriage. His main argument is that he should not be liable to pay <Emphasis type=\"i\">interim maintenance</Emphasis> to Q <Emphasis type=\"i\">at all</Emphasis>, or, alternatively, that he should be refunded a portion of the interim maintenance paid to Q.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"129\" pID=\"p1_129\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The primary basis for the Husband\u2019s argument is that he had not, at any point during the marriage, accepted Q as a member of his family. His evidence is that Q has never acknowledged him as her father and that they had a distant relationship. Although he had given gifts to Q, these were, he argues, given out of generosity. He also deposes that he has never taken part in disciplining Q. Additionally, while he lived with Q during the first three years of his marriage, Q did not come along to live with them at Lentor Vale and instead continued to live with her grandmother and aunt at the Park Green apartment, although Lentor Vale had the space to accommodate her.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"130\" pID=\"p1_130\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Against this, the Wife argues that the Husband had in fact accepted Q as a member of his family for the following reasons:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_130-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It was under the mutual understanding that the Husband agreed to accept Q as his child that the Wife agreed to marry him in the first place.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_130-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Husband declared that Q was his child in order to obtain a junior membership to the American Club for Q.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(c)\" pID=\"p1_130-p2_c\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Q\u2019s name was included under the list of granddaughters in the Husband\u2019s father\u2019s obituary in the Chinese newspaper.</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"131\" pID=\"p1_131\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Husband also explained that Q\u2019s American Club junior membership had only lasted for three months, from February to April 2011. The purpose of obtaining American Club membership for Q was so that she could study for her GCE \u201cO\u201d Level examinations there, as she liked the club. In so far as the Husband\u2019s father\u2019s obituary was concerned, his evidence is that Q\u2019s name was \u201csurreptitiously \u2018planted\u2019\u201d there. Furthermore, he states that Q\u2019s name was in Chinese characters in the obituary, and that no one knew Q\u2019s Chinese name at that time.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"132\" pID=\"p1_132\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As we have explained above, the fact that the Husband married the Wife knowing that she had a child from a prior relationship is <Emphasis type=\"i\">prima facie</Emphasis> evidence of his acceptance of Q as a member of his family. At the time of the marriage, Q was only about ten years old. The evidence which the Husband points to does not contradict the <Emphasis type=\"i\">prima facie</Emphasis> position, and self-serving statements made on his part are to be accorded little weight. It is not disputed that he had had lived with Q in the Park Green apartment for about three years, and had provided for Q by buying her gifts and even procured a junior membership at the American Club for Q. In our judgment, this is sufficient to demonstrate that the Husband accepted Q as a member of his family. There was therefore a basis upon which the court could order the Husband to pay interim maintenance to Q under s\u00a0127(1) of the Act.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Whether the Husband\u2019s duty to maintain Q has ceased</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"133\" pID=\"p1_133\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Having found that the Husband owed a duty to maintain Q under s\u00a070(1), the issue before us is whether or not he was bound to continue maintaining her or whether he could discontinue such maintenance given that the marriage had broken down. To the extent that the Husband\u2019s duty under s\u00a070(1) ceased, a refund of the maintenance paid after that date would be ordered, as there would be no basis for the ordering of interim maintenance under s\u00a0127(1) of the Act.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"134\" pID=\"p1_134\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the present case, since the marriage between the Husband and Wife has broken down, and the Wife has taken Q away from the Husband, it was not appropriate for the Husband to have had to pay maintenance for Q over the period which he did (3\u00a0years and 11\u00a0months), especially since the marriage effectively lasted only for 4.5\u00a0years. We have explained above that in the usual case, a step-parent\u2019s duty to maintain a child would cease once the interim judgment for divorce is granted. We see no reason to depart from this general position in the present case. We therefore order a refund of $40,000 to the Husband, which was the maintenance paid by the Husband to Q after the month in which the interim judgment for divorce was granted (<Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, December 2013).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"135\" pID=\"p1_135\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In summary, CA\u00a0119/2015, CA\u00a0120/2015 and SUM\u00a015/2016 are allowed in part.

The Judge explained that under the Act, a judgment of\n                    nullity may be obtained for both void and voidable marriages (see the Judgment\n                    at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_9 ext\">[9]</ParaXRef>). He then briefly described the\n                    differences between void and voidable marriages (see the Judgment at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_10 ext\">[10]</ParaXRef>\u2013<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_12 ext\">[12]</ParaXRef>). He concluded that the wording of s\u00a0112(1) does not\n                    offer any indication as to whether \u201cnullity of marriage\u201d refers to\n                    both void and voidable marriages. He was, however, prepared to take the view\n                    that the court has the power to divide matrimonial assets in the context of a\n                        <Emphasis type=\"i\">voidable</Emphasis> marriage on the ground that assets\n                    acquired up to the point of dissolution are matrimonial assets (see the Judgment\n                    at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_12 ext\">[12]</ParaXRef>).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge proceeded to express his view that\n                    it is not appropriate for a court to determine the effects of a void marriage\n                    (see the Judgment at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_14 ext\">[14]</ParaXRef>). This is\n                    because a marriage may be found to be void for various reasons. For example, a\n                    party may have acted in good faith or he/she might have been deceptive. These\n                    different factual situations would require different treatment and would require\n                    a consideration of \u201clegal, sociological and public policy\n                    considerations\u201d (see the Judgment at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_14 ext\">[14]</ParaXRef>).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge nevertheless proceeded to rule that\n                    a division of matrimonial assets is not possible where the marriage is void. He\n                    reasoned that a void marriage is not a marriage and so there are no\n                    \u201cmatrimonial assets\u201d to divide. Assets acquired in the course of\n                    the marriage will have to be divided according to property, contract, trust or\n                    other relevant principles of law (see the Judgment at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_15 ext\">[15]</ParaXRef>). Similarly, the Judge ruled that it was\n                    not possible to order maintenance because s\u00a0113 of the Act refers to\n                    maintenance of a \u201cwife or former wife\u201d. A claimant in a void\n                    marriage is neither (see the Judgment at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_16 ext\">[16]</ParaXRef>). The Judge further commented that it might have been\n                    argued that there is another basis for seeking maintenance if the parties had\n                    maintained their relationship in the belief that they had a legal marriage. The\n                    Judge observed, however, that this possibility \u201cmust remain as food for\n                    thought\u201d because the Appellant did not raise such a possibility (see the\n                    Judgment at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_18 ext\">[18]</ParaXRef>).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It should be noted that the decision below\n                    also addressed an issue of maintenance for the Appellant\u2019s child from a\n                    previous relationship.

This is apparent from s\u00a0104 of the Act which provides\n                        that any \u201chusband or wife\u201d may file a writ claiming a judgment\n                        of nullity in respect of his or her marriage. This suggests that the words\n                        \u201cwife\u201d or \u201cformer wife\u201d in s\u00a0113 of the Act\n                        are simply labels used to denote the female party to the void\n                        marriage.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_17-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It\n                        may be argued (in this instance, <Emphasis type=\"i\">contrary</Emphasis> to\n                        the Appellant\u2019s case) that interpreting s\u00a0113 of the Act as\n                        allowing an award of maintenance even if a marriage is found to be void will\n                        render s\u00a0113 of the Act incongruous with s\u00a069 of the Act.\n                        Section\u00a069 of the Act concerns an order for maintenance to a\n                        \u201cmarried woman\u201d while the marriage is still subsisting. The\n                        phrase \u201cmarried woman\u201d is defined in s\u00a02 of the Act as a\n                        woman \u201cvalidly married under any law, religion, custom or\n                        usage\u201d. In other words, a woman in a void marriage is not a\n                        \u201cmarried woman\u201d and, hence, would not be able to claim\n                        maintenance under s\u00a069 of the Act. An argument could be made that it\n                        would be incongruous to say that a woman is not entitled to maintenance\n                        while a void marriage is \u201csubsisting\u201d but yet is entitled to\n                        maintenance under s\u00a0113 of the Act after she obtains a judgment of\n                        nullity. Prof\u00a0Tan submitted that this incongruity may be explained away\n                        by the fact that s\u00a0113 of the Act uses the words \u201cwife or former\n                        wife\u201d, a phrase which is not defined in the Act, whereas s\u00a069 of\n                        the Act uses the phrase \u201cmarried woman\u201d, which, as just\n                        mentioned, is defined in s\u00a02 of the Act.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(c)\" pID=\"p1_17-p2_c\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The court has the power to take into account all\n                        the relevant circumstances of the case in deciding on the division of\n                        matrimonial assets and in ordering maintenance. This means that the court\n                        may take into consideration any egregious conduct on the part of one of the\n                        parties to the marriage.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(d)\" pID=\"p1_17-p2_d\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a047, 1970\u00a0Rev Ed)\n                        (\u201cthe 1970\u00a0Rev Ed\u201d) did not draw a distinction between\n                        void and voidable marriages. Section\u00a091 of the 1970\u00a0Rev Ed simply\n                        provided for the grounds for seeking a decree of nullity, including the\n                        ground \u201cthat the former husband or wife of either party was living at\n                        the time of the marriage and the marriage with such former husband or wife\n                        was then in force\u201d. Significantly, s\u00a0107(1) of the 1970\u00a0Rev\n                        Ed provided, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, that on any decree\n                        for nullity of marriage, \u201cthe court may, if it thinks fit, order that\n                        the husband shall, to the satisfaction of the court, secure to the wife such\n                        gross sum of money or such annual sum of money for any term not exceeding\n                        her life\u201d. Prof\u00a0Tan submitted that the effect of these\n                        provisions was that under the 1970\u00a0Rev Ed, the court could order\n                        maintenance even in the context of an annulled marriage. Prof Tan argued\n                        that Parliament could not have intended to change the legal position when\n                        the distinction between void and voidable marriages was later introduced.

According to the Appellant, in the Rescission Proceedings, both the\n                    first District Judge and the High Court Judge on appeal considered the\n                    parties\u2019 detailed submissions and held that the courts have the power to\n                    make ancillary orders under Pt\u00a0X of the Act even for void\n                        marriages.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_32\">32</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_32\" label=\"32\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">AC at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_33 ext\">[33]</ParaXRef>.</Text></Para></Footnote> As noted above, one\n                    of the reasons for the first District Judge\u2019s refusal to grant a\n                    declaration that the Hong Kong Marriage was void was that she thought that a\n                    nullity petition would be a more appropriate avenue for making such a\n                    determination (see [6(c)] above). In elaborating on this reason, the first\n                    District Judge opined that ancillary relief may be obtained for void as well as\n                    voidable marriages.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_33\">33</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_33\" label=\"33\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">ACB Vol\u00a0II at\n                            p\u00a031.</Text></Para></Footnote></Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Our view was that the second and third\n                    elements of issue estoppel are certainly satisfied. The parties to the\n                    Rescission Proceedings and the present proceedings (an appeal against a\n                    Judge\u2019s determination on ancillary matters) are identical and the\n                    decisions of the first District Judge (and the High Court Judge on appeal) were\n                    made by courts of competent jurisdiction. The issue is with the first and final\n                    elements.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"25\" pID=\"p1_25\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We did not think, however, that the first and\n                    final elements were satisfied. In respect of the final element, there was no\n                    identity in the subject matter of the Rescission Proceedings and the present\n                    proceedings. In the Rescission Proceedings, the first District Judge was asked\n                    to rescind the <Emphasis type=\"i\">decree nisi</Emphasis> and declare that the\n                    Hong Kong Marriage was void. The first District Judge gave three reasons why it\n                    was inappropriate to grant a declaration. In explaining just one of her reasons,\n                    she expressed a view on the availability of ancillary relief. In contrast, the\n                    present proceedings raised squarely for decision the issue of whether ancillary\n                    relief is available. In other words, the first District Judge\u2019s view that\n                    ancillary relief is available in void marriages was <Emphasis type=\"i\">collateral</Emphasis> to the issue that she had to decide. She was not\n                    required to express such a view. In fact, the first District Judge herself\n                    appeared to recognise that it was not her role to decide on whether ancillary\n                    relief is available for void marriages. On the issue as to whether maintenance\n                    is available in void marriages, the first District Judge qualified her\n                    observation with a comment that the possibility of obtaining maintenance was an\n                    issue that she \u201c[did] not have to decide now\u201d.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_34\">34</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_34\" label=\"34\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">ACB Vol\u00a0II at p\u00a032.</Text></Para></Footnote> For\n                    the same reasons, the first District Judge (and the High Court Judge on appeal)\n                    did not conclusively decide on the issues raised in this appeal and the first\n                    element was not satisfied. The first District Judge was merely expressing a view\n                    on the issues in order to bolster her conclusions on the matter that was before\n                    her (which was different from the subject matter of this appeal).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"26\" pID=\"p1_26\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We therefore found that there was no <Emphasis type=\"i\">res </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"i\">judicata</Emphasis> in respect of\n                    the remaining two issues before us.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Do Singapore courts have the power to divide matrimonial assets and\n                order maintenance in the context of a void marriage?</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It would be convenient to consider the second\n                    and third issues together.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"28\" pID=\"p1_28\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Since these two issues are, essentially,\n                    issues of statutory interpretation, we will begin our analysis with an\n                    examination of the wording of the relevant provisions.

The Judge seemed to take the view that there ought to be read\n                    into this phrase a reference <Emphasis type=\"i\">only</Emphasis> to a <Emphasis type=\"i\">voidable</Emphasis> (as opposed to a void) marriage. With respect,\n                    this is inconsistent with the manner in which the phrase \u201cnullity of\n                    marriage\u201d has been utilised by the Singapore Parliament in the Act\n                    itself. Indeed, this very phrase constitutes the heading which helms the\n                    preceding chapter of Pt\u00a0X of the Act, which relates to <Emphasis type=\"i\">both</Emphasis> void <Emphasis type=\"i\">and</Emphasis> voidable marriages.\n                    In our view, if Parliament had intended the phrase \u201cnullity of\n                    marriage\u201d in the aforementioned provisions to refer to <Emphasis type=\"i\">voidable</Emphasis> marriages <Emphasis type=\"i\">only</Emphasis>, it would\n                    have stated so <Emphasis type=\"i\">expressly</Emphasis>. Lest it be thought that\n                    such a plain reading of both provisions would militate against the tenor and\n                    spirit of the Act in general and the specific provisions therein in particular,\n                    we elaborate on the legislative background in more detail below (at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_34\">[34]</ParaXRef>\u2013<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_45\">[45]</ParaXRef>). Nevertheless, even if we look only at the provisions\n                    themselves, it is clear, in our view, that Parliament <Emphasis type=\"i\">intended</Emphasis>, in no uncertain terms, that the courts exercise their\n                    powers pursuant to ss\u00a0112(1) and 113(<Emphasis type=\"i\">b</Emphasis>) in\n                    all cases relating to nullity of marriage (which, as already noted above in this\n                    paragraph, includes both void as well as voidable marriages)<Emphasis type=\"i\">.</Emphasis> That is the <Emphasis type=\"i\">plain and\n                        unambiguous</Emphasis> meaning of the phrase \u201cnullity of\n                    marriage\u201d, read <Emphasis type=\"i\">both</Emphasis> literally <Emphasis type=\"i\">as well as</Emphasis> in the context alluded to briefly above.\n                    Further, no absurdity results from such a construction. Whilst courts have long\n                    discarded a dogmatic as well as mechanistic approach towards statutory\n                    interpretation, they simultaneously ought <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> to\n                    swing to the other extreme as well. Put simply, courts are not \u2013 and ought\n                    to not act as if they are \u2013 \u201cmini-legislatures\u201d. With\n                    respect, the Judge should have tried to discern Parliament\u2019s intention\n                    from the provisions as a whole and their context instead of focusing on other\n                    parts of the same provisions (see the Judgment at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_15 ext\">[15]</ParaXRef>\u2013<ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_16 ext\">[16]</ParaXRef>). In so\n                    doing, the Judge had <Emphasis type=\"i\">superimposed</Emphasis> a meaning on the\n                    relevant statutory language which Parliament had never intended. That having\n                    been said, the <Emphasis type=\"i\">legislative</Emphasis> intention or purpose\n                    that the phrase \u201cnullity of marriage\u201d encompasses <Emphasis type=\"i\">both</Emphasis> void <Emphasis type=\"i\">and</Emphasis> voidable\n                    marriages is made <Emphasis type=\"i\">even clearer</Emphasis> by, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis type=\"i\">legislative\n                        background</Emphasis> as well.

An\n                    excellent account of the history of the Malaysian Act has been given elsewhere\n                    (see B C Crown, \u201cProperty Division on Dissolution of Marriage\u201d\n                    (1988) 30\u00a0Mal LR 34 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Crown</Emphasis>\u201d)\n                    at pp\u00a037\u221241). What is crucial for the purposes of the present judgment,\n                    however, is the fact that the relevant provisions in the Malaysian Act did\n                        <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> contain the phrase \u201cnullity of\n                    marriage\u201d (see ss\u00a076 and 77 of the Malaysian Act which relate to the\n                    division of matrimonial assets and the power for the court to order maintenance\n                    of a spouse, respectively) and that this was <Emphasis type=\"i\">also\n                        reflected</Emphasis> in the 1980\u00a0Bill which, as just noted, drew upon\n                    the aforementioned provisions of the Malaysian Act.

The\n                    one that is germane to the present appeal relates to her suggestions with regard\n                    to the omission in the 1980 Bill of petitions of nullity in relation to the\n                    clauses pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets as well as financial\n                    provision for the wife (a point noted above at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_34\">[34]</ParaXRef>).

This\n                            omission is <Emphasis type=\"i\">unfortunate because the existing statute\n                                in Sections 107 and 114 </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"i\">clearly\n                                allow</Emphasis> [<Emphasis type=\"i\">sic</Emphasis>] <Emphasis type=\"i\">the court to order financial provision for the\n                                \u201cwife\u201d in a nullity petition.

Indeed, her focus is \u2013 rightly, if we\n                    may say so \u2013 on the substance (as opposed to the form) of the matter. And\n                    it is that the family unit can disintegrate in at least two main ways, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, by divorce or through a petition for nullity. The\n                    main point of substance, however, is <Emphasis type=\"i\">precisely</Emphasis>\n                    that the family unit has in fact <Emphasis type=\"i\">disintegrated</Emphasis>,\n                    and <Emphasis type=\"i\">that</Emphasis> constitutes the <Emphasis type=\"i\">commonality</Emphasis> between the parties, <Emphasis type=\"i\">which ought\n                        (in fairness) to be addressed</Emphasis>. Once this is admitted, it is\n                    clear, in our view, that the Singapore Parliament <Emphasis type=\"i\">had\n                        appropriately added the phrase \u201cnullity of marriage\u201d (although\n                        absent in the 1980\u00a0Bill)</Emphasis>, inter alia<Emphasis type=\"i\">,\n                        into ss\u00a0112 and 113 of the Act.</Emphasis> Indeed, we would add that,\n                    to achieve the full purpose of providing for <Emphasis type=\"i\">all</Emphasis>\n                    concerned in the event of the <Emphasis type=\"i\">disintegration of the family\n                        unit</Emphasis> (for <Emphasis type=\"i\">whatever reason</Emphasis>), the\n                    phrase \u201cnullity of marriage\u201d which was ultimately inserted into\n                    ss\u00a0112 and 113 of the Act <Emphasis type=\"i\">must</Emphasis> be given\n                        <Emphasis type=\"i\">its plain meaning</Emphasis> (<Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, that <Emphasis type=\"i\">both</Emphasis> void <Emphasis type=\"i\">as well as</Emphasis> voidable marriages are encompassed within the\n                    meaning of, <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter alia</Emphasis>, ss\u00a0112 and 113 of the\n                    Act).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"40\" pID=\"p1_40\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The views by the same author in her textbook\n                    ought also to be noted. Consistent with her views set out above, the learned\n                    author argues that <Emphasis type=\"i\">ancillary relief</Emphasis> ought to be\n                    available with regard to <Emphasis type=\"i\">void</Emphasis> marriages (see Leong\n                    Wai Kum, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Elements of Family Law in Singapore</Emphasis>\n                    (LexisNexis, 2007) (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Leong Wai Kum</Emphasis>\u201d)\n                    at p\u00a076). She explains that although a judgment of nullity is conceptually\n                    meaningless where a marriage is void <Emphasis type=\"i\">ab </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"i\">initio</Emphasis>, obtaining such a judgment is useful in practice\n                    because it allows the parties access to the court\u2019s jurisdiction to order\n                    ancillary relief (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ibid</Emphasis>). Prof\u00a0Leong also\n                    points out that there is no case law discussing whether the court\u2019s\n                    exercise of its ancillary powers should be \u201cattenuated\u201d where a\n                    marriage is void, as compared to the more conventional situation of a\n                    termination by divorce (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ibid</Emphasis>).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"41\" pID=\"p1_41\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Although the reason for\n                    Prof\u00a0Leong\u2019s view in her textbook is not immediately apparent in this\n                    particular portion of her work, another part of the book may, however, provide\n                    an explanation as to why parties to a void marriage should, in her view, be\n                    entitled to ancillary relief (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Leong Wai Kum</Emphasis> at\n                    pp\u00a040\u201344). Prof\u00a0Leong explains that a distinction should be\n                    drawn between a \u201cnon-marriage\u201d and a \u201cvoid marriage\u201d\n                    (see also Joseph Jackson, <Emphasis type=\"i\">The Formation and Annulment of\n                        Marriage</Emphasis> (2nd\u00a0Ed, Butterworths, 1969) (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Jackson</Emphasis>\u201d) at pp\u00a085\u201386). She uses the\n                    term \u201cnon-marriage\u201d to refer to a situation where the parties have\n                    no marital relationship <Emphasis type=\"i\">whatsoever</Emphasis> (the example\n                    Prof Leong gives is a stranger coming up to a person and claiming that he is\n                    married to her). In contrast, parties to a void marriage may have conducted\n                    themselves as if the marriage was valid. Prof\u00a0Leong proceeds to argue that\n                    a workable distinction between \u201cvoid marriages\u201d and\n                    \u201cnon-marriages\u201d is that the former category of marriages fulfils\n                    the fundamental contractual requirements of marriage: <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, there must be credible evidence of an exchange of a mutual\n                    intention to marry (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Leong Wai Kum</Emphasis> at\n                    p\u00a041).

Indeed, the concept of\n                    nullity of marriage arose as a result of the fact that the courts in England\n                    could not then grant decrees of divorce because marriage was (at that particular\n                    point in time) considered a sacrament, which (in turn) resulted in the\n                    indissolubility of marriage (see, for example,\n                    N\u00a0V\u00a0Lowe\u00a0and\u00a0G\u00a0Douglas, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Bromley\u2019s Family Law</Emphasis> (10th\u00a0Ed, Oxford University\n                    Press, 2007) (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Lowe\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Douglas</Emphasis>\u201d) at pp\u00a067\u201368).\n                    However, in addition to divorces <Emphasis type=\"i\">a mensa et thoro</Emphasis>\n                    (or judicial separation), the courts could grant decrees of nullity instead in\n                    order to mitigate the hardships engendered by the indissolubility of marriage\n                    (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Adams v Adams</Emphasis> [1941] 1\u00a0KB\u00a0536 at 541, <Emphasis type=\"i\">per</Emphasis> Scott\u00a0LJ and the Royal Commission on Divorce\n                    and Matrimonial Causes, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Report of the Royal Commission on\n                        Divorce and Matrimonial Causes</Emphasis> (Cd\u00a06478, 1912) (\u201cthe\n                        <Emphasis type=\"i\">1912\u00a0Report</Emphasis>\u201d) at para\u00a013)\n                    \u2013 one practical (and desirable) result of which was that remarriage was\n                    permitted during the lifetime of a spouse.

The following extract from a leading\n                    English textbook on family law concisely explains this conflict (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Lowe\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Douglas</Emphasis> at p\u00a068):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">By the beginning of the seventeenth century, however, the royal courts\n                        were becoming concerned at the ease with which marriages could be set aside\n                        and the issue bastardised. This was more likely to work injustice after the\n                        parties\u2019 death, when relevant evidence might no longer be available.\n                        Accordingly, they <Emphasis type=\"bi\">cut down</Emphasis> the ecclesiastical\n                        courts\u2019 jurisdiction by forbidding them to annul marriages in certain\n                        cases after the death of either party. <Emphasis type=\"bi\">This had the\n                            result of dividing impediments into two kinds: civil and\n                            canonical</Emphasis>.

In\n                    particular, <Emphasis type=\"i\">civil</Emphasis> impediments were those which\n                    went to <Emphasis type=\"i\">the very formation</Emphasis> of the marriage itself\n                    and, from the perspective of a \u201cdivision\u201d of jurisdiction, were\n                    appropriate for the <Emphasis type=\"i\">civil</Emphasis> sphere as they related\n                    (in the main) to impediments that were more <Emphasis type=\"i\">formal</Emphasis>\n                    in nature (see also the observation in a leading work that \u201c[t]he real\n                    distinction is not so much between a void marriage and a voidable marriage as\n                    between a void <Emphasis type=\"i\">ceremony</Emphasis> and a voidable\n                    marriage\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Jackson</Emphasis> at\n                    pp\u00a084\u201385 [emphasis added]; see also <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tolstoy</Emphasis> at pp\u00a0385\u2013386). Reference may also be made to\n                        <Emphasis type=\"i\">Leong</Emphasis> at p\u00a0588 (\u201cThe law of\n                        <Emphasis type=\"bi\">solemnisation</Emphasis> of marriage would not be\n                    complete if there were no sanctions for its breach. The most serious sanction is\n                    that the result is a void marriage, <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, a union\n                    that lacks legal validity. It will not be possible to ensure due compliance with\n                    the statutory requirements of the law of <Emphasis type=\"bi\">solemnisation</Emphasis> if not for this most serious sanction for\n                    breach\u201d [emphasis added in bold italics; emphasis in italics in\n                    original]) and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Ong</Emphasis> at p\u00a0278). And, from the\n                    perspective of <Emphasis type=\"i\">legal result</Emphasis>, treating marriages\n                    that do not comply with the requirements for solemnisation as <Emphasis type=\"i\">void</Emphasis> (as opposed to <Emphasis type=\"i\">being</Emphasis>\n                    voidable) was also both logical and commonsensical. Hence, where the very\n                        <Emphasis type=\"i\">ceremony</Emphasis> itself was flawed, there was\n                    justification in treating the marriage itself as being <Emphasis type=\"i\">void\n                        ab </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"i\">initio</Emphasis> \u2013 as being fatally\n                    flawed, so to speak, right from <Emphasis type=\"i\">its outset</Emphasis>. So,\n                    also, there was similar justification in treating the marriage concerned as\n                    being <Emphasis type=\"i\">void ab </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"i\">initio</Emphasis>\n                    where one of the parties was <Emphasis type=\"i\">already married</Emphasis> at\n                    the time the marriage purportedly took place.

Hence, for example, where the marriage cannot be consummated owing to\n                    the incapacity of one party or to the refusal by one party to consummate the\n                    marriage, or where there is some other incapacity on the part of one of the\n                    parties (such as the absence of valid consent, the presence of mental disorder\n                    or venereal disease of a communicable nature, or being pregnant by some person\n                    other than the petitioner), the marriage concerned is rendered null and void\n                        <Emphasis type=\"i\">only at the option of the petitioner </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"i\">once he or she is aware of the impediment concerned</Emphasis>, not\n                    least because, as just mentioned, these impediments will <Emphasis type=\"i\">not\n                        necessarily</Emphasis> go towards the <Emphasis type=\"i\">formation</Emphasis> of the marriage.

To recapitulate,\n                    there is nothing in the historical development of the law relating to nullity of\n                    marriage which militates against the courts being granted the powers in these\n                    specific areas. It is therefore not surprising that the Singapore Parliament\n                    intentionally conferred these powers, which were in fact absent in the 1980\n                    Bill, by the insertion of references to \u201cnullity of marriage\u201d in\n                    the respective provisions.

The Husband was made\n                    redundant at work in or about 2007. He then decided to enter into a business\n                    venture with another partner. Together, they incorporated a company which was in\n                    the business of providing solutions for the felling, renewal and processing of\n                    rubber wood in Indonesia. The Husband\u2019s evidence is that he and his\n                    partner each invested $1m in the company while also seeking funding from\n                    external investors. The company, however, was never profitable. Despite that,\n                    the Husband was paid a substantial monthly salary of $22,438 by the company from\n                    September 2009 onwards. As mentioned above, the terms of the Consent Order were\n                    recorded on 13 July 2010.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Less than a year later, on 14 June 2011, the\n                    Husband brought an application to vary the terms of the Consent Order in\n                    relation to the division of the matrimonial assets and maintenance for the Wife\n                    and the Children on the ground that there had been a material change in the\n                    circumstances due to the failure of the company. The District Judge ordered that\n                    the Consent Order be varied but not quite in the way the Husband had wanted. The\n                    District Judge ordered that the Matrimonial Property be sold within six months\n                    and also made provisions for some minor variation to the maintenance of one of\n                    the Children, JLR. The Husband appealed to the High Court, and later to the\n                    Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal decided the appeal in relation to varying\n                    that part of the Consent Order concerning the division of matrimonial assets but\n                    remitted the issue of varying the Consent Order in relation to maintenance back\n                    to the High Court.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the meantime, three significant events took\n                    place. First, the Matrimonial Property was sold for $5.1m, which was a much\n                    higher price than what the parties had contemplated (even on their most\n                    optimistic calculations). Secondly, the Wife brought an application for the\n                    order for periodic maintenance payments to be converted to a lump sum payment.\n                    Thirdly, the Wife and the Children relocated to Sydney, Australia in January\n                    2012, while the Husband remarried a Singaporean lady and currently lives in\n                    Singapore with her and her two children from her previous\n                marriage.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"9\" pID=\"p1_9\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As directed by the Court of Appeal, all issues\n                    relating to maintenance were heard by the Judge (by which time the events\n                    described in the preceding paragraph had already transpired). Before the Judge,\n                    the Husband sought to reduce the amount of periodic maintenance payable under\n                    the Consent Order by arguing that there were two material changes in the\n                    circumstances: (1) that there had been a change in his financial circumstances\n                    due to the failure of his business venture; and (2) that the parties had\n                    obtained an unexpected windfall from the sale of the Matrimonial Property. The\n                    Wife, on the other hand, sought to vary the Consent Order by converting the\n                    periodic maintenance payments into a lump sum. In her application, the Wife\n                    initially sought $750,000 for herself and $1.845m for the children but was\n                    eventually willing to accept a reduced amount of $250,000 for herself and\n                    $750,000 for the Children. Although there was no specific evidence on this, we\n                    deduced that these sums were arrived at having regard to payments already made\n                    by the Husband by this time. The Wife did not take any position on the\n                    Husband\u2019s contention that the windfall gain from the sale of the\n                    Matrimonial Property should be taken into account.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge held that a lump sum payment was\n                    appropriate, and the quantum of maintenance sought by the Wife was reasonable in\n                    light of the original amount of maintenance payments that were to be made under\n                    the Consent Order.

On the other hand,\n                    the wife was well-off, owning two properties in prime locations and a luxury\n                    car.

He was drawing a monthly salary of $22,438 and the business\n                    prospects looked promising.

This was on top of him agreeing to\n                    divide the matrimonial assets in a manner which would give the Wife a generous\n                    share of the assets. The business, however, did not take off. This resulted in a\n                    withdrawal of the external funding and the Husband eventually resigned from the\n                    company in March 2012.

However, as pointed out by the\n                    Wife, the documentary evidence shows that parties had agreed to the proposed\n                    terms in the Consent Order as early as May 2010. The documentary evidence also\n                    shows that the Husband had raised concerns at various points in 2010 and that by\n                    October 2010, less than three months after the date of the Consent Order, he was\n                    claiming that he was in a precarious financial position. These facts lead us to\n                    conclude that the Husband could not reasonably have been relying on the success\n                    of the Company at the time of the Consent Order. He was well aware of the risks\n                    he was facing. But those were the circumstances in which he agreed to the\n                    Consent Order. We do not wish to speculate on the Husband\u2019s reasons for\n                    taking the stance that he did, but it is clear to us that in these\n                    circumstances, the failure of the Company could not constitute a material change\n                    in the circumstances. We therefore agree in substance with the Judge\u2019s\n                    conclusion on this point.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">The higher sale proceeds received from the Matrimonial\n                Property</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We now consider the second change of\n                    circumstance relied on by the Husband. As mentioned above, it is not disputed\n                    that the sale of the Matrimonial Property at $5.1m was at a much higher price\n                    than what the parties had envisaged even on the most optimistic basis. This was\n                    clear from the correspondence between the parties when negotiating the Consent\n                    Order, where the parties estimated that the highest price the Matrimonial\n                    Property could fetch would be $3.75m. Using this as the outer limit, the parties\n                    therefore obtained an entirely unforeseen and unexpected windfall of\n                    $1.35m.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"28\" pID=\"p1_28\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As we have mentioned above, the Consent Order\n                    provided that the Wife would get 70% and the Husband would get 30% of the\n                    proceeds of sale if the sale price of the matrimonial property exceeded $2.5m.\n                    As it stands, the Wife has received 70% of the $1.35m windfall which neither\n                    party had expected at the time when they agreed on the terms of the Consent\n                    Order.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"29\" pID=\"p1_29\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">When the terms of the Consent Order (including\n                    those in relation to maintenance) were agreed upon, this was done with certain\n                    expectations of what the Wife would be getting from the division of the\n                    matrimonial assets. We agree with the Husband that the reality, which departed\n                    considerably from those expectations, constituted a material change in the\n                    circumstances. As matters transpired, the Wife has in fact received a larger\n                    amount than what was initially expected from the division of the matrimonial\n                    assets. In our judgment, this would justify a reduction in the agreed quantum of\n                    maintenance since the Wife would be in a better position to provide for herself\n                    and the Children as a result of this windfall.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"30\" pID=\"p1_30\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As to the extent of the downward variation, we\n                    find that an appropriate figure would be $270,000.

This was in essence an acceptance of the position that\n                    the Wife had put forward and it is therefore unsurprising that the Wife has not\n                    appealed those orders. These lump sum orders are logically the point at which\n                    our analysis should begin.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"33\" pID=\"p1_33\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the course of the arguments, however, the\n                    Husband made reference to the fact that he had already made substantial payments\n                    since the date of the Consent Order and there was a suggestion that these\n                    payments should, <Emphasis type=\"i\">in addition to</Emphasis> any other\n                    adjustment we might make, be offset against the lump sum of $1m ordered by the\n                    Judge. We disagree. In our view, it is only fair to proceed on the basis that\n                    when the Wife proposed the aggregate lump sum order of $1m, this <Emphasis type=\"i\">already</Emphasis> took into account all the payments made by the\n                    Husband until then. Let us elaborate.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"34\" pID=\"p1_34\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We begin by examining the terms of the Consent\n                    Order. In relation to the Wife, she was entitled to a sum of at least $3,990 per\n                    month under the Consent Order. Using a multiplier of 26 years based on the\n                    Wife\u2019s submissions, in reliance on the formula used by this Court in\n                        <Emphasis type=\"i\">Wan Lai Cheng</Emphasis>, this yields a sum of\n                    $1,244,880. Subjecting this to a 20% discount to take account of the fact that\n                    the payment is being made upfront in a lump sum would reduce this to $995,904.\n                    This was also the figure arrived at by the Judge. In addition, the parties agree\n                    that the Husband has already paid maintenance for the Wife amounting to\n                    $100,264.83.

The\n                    reduction is made having regard to the resources available to the Wife to\n                    provide for herself and the Children (as explained above at [29]). Moreover, we\n                    are satisfied that it is in the interests of the Children\u2019s welfare that\n                    there be a lump sum order for maintenance since this would, as we have observed,\n                    help reduce the occasion for acrimony between the parties.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"46\" pID=\"p1_46\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We further consider that the sum of $40,000\n                    that has been paid by the Husband <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> the 12\n                    August 2013 by way of interim maintenance should also be deducted from the lump\n                    sum amount. This leaves a balance of $690,000 which we hold should be the lump\n                    sum payable by the Husband. We further hold that this sum should be apportioned\n                    as $100,000 in respect of the payments due to the Wife and $590,000 in respect\n                    of the payments due to the Children.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"47\" pID=\"p1_47\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Finally, we return to the issue of whether a\n                    lump sum payment would cripple the Husband financially. In our judgment, an\n                    order requiring payment of the sum of $690,000 would not do so. It is the\n                    Husband\u2019s own affidavit evidence that he has $985,323.87 left from his\n                    share of the sale proceeds from the Matrimonial Property. The Husband later\n                    asserted in his submissions before the Judge that he only has $800,000 left, but\n                    even if we accept that to be the case, that is still a sufficient sum of money\n                    for him to make the lump sum payment without crippling him financially. This is\n                    aside from the other assets that he owns. Insofar as the Husband contends that\n                    he has undertaken fresh obligations to his new family, we do not consider that\n                    this should affect or compromise the pre-existing obligations he continues to\n                    owe to the Wife and his children from his previous marriage.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"48\" pID=\"p1_48\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the foregoing reasons, we allow the\n                    appeals in part and order that the Judge\u2019s order for maintenance be\n                    reduced so that the Husband is to pay a lump sum of $690,000 to the Wife being a\n                    sum of $100,000 by way of lump sum maintenance for her and a sum of $590,000 by\n                    way of lump sum maintenance for the Children inclusive of their school\n                    fees.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"49\" pID=\"p1_49\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We make no order as to costs.

  <Coram>\n        <Judge>Andrew Phang Boon Leong\u00a0JA</Judge> (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):</Coram>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Introduction</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"1\" pID=\"p1_1\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) in <Emphasis type=\"i\">APE v APF</Emphasis> [2015] SGHC 17 (\u201cthe GD\u201d) dealing with all the ancillary matters which arose pursuant to the divorce of the appellant Wife and the respondent Husband. We dismissed the Wife\u2019s appeal. As we stated after hearing the oral submissions from the respective parties, we found no reason to interfere with the decision of the Judge on all the issues. We therefore upheld his decision to: (a)\u00a0grant joint custody of the only child of the marriage to both parents; (b)\u00a0divide the matrimonial home in the ratio of 70:30 in favour of the Wife; (c)\u00a0award a monthly sum of $1,500 in respect of maintenance to the child to be borne equally by both parents; and (d)\u00a0preserve the Wife\u2019s legal right to future maintenance.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"2\" pID=\"p1_2\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">However, we found it necessary to make one clarification pertaining to the last-mentioned issue of maintenance to the Wife. Specifically, our concern centred on the Judge\u2019s decision to make \u201cno order\u201d on her application for maintenance instead of an order for nominal maintenance. In doing so, he was of the view that such an order would <Emphasis type=\"i\">not preclude</Emphasis> the Wife from applying for maintenance in the future should there be a need to do so. As we shall elaborate upon below, an order to the effect that there was \u201cno order\u201d did <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis>, with respect, have the legal effect which the Judge thought it did. Indeed, such an order would have the <Emphasis type=\"i\">opposite</Emphasis> legal effect which the Judge intended it to have. Put simply an order to the effect that there was \u201cno order\u201d would, as we explain below, have resulted in a <Emphasis type=\"i\">rejection</Emphasis> of the Wife\u2019s application for maintenance and would have therefore <Emphasis type=\"i\">precluded</Emphasis> her from applying for maintenance should such a need to do so arise in the future. As we were of the view (<Emphasis type=\"i\">like the Judge</Emphasis>) that the Wife should be afforded the opportunity to apply for maintenance in the future should there be a need to do so, we ordered, instead, that there would be nominal maintenance of $1 per year for the Wife. In summary, we did not differ \u2013 in <Emphasis type=\"i\">substantive result</Emphasis> \u2013 from the order the Judge had made in this particular regard. However, we differed from him inasmuch as the <Emphasis type=\"i\">legal mechanism</Emphasis> which he adopted was, with respect, the incorrect one. In so holding, we reaffirm the decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok v Loh Kum Yong</Emphasis> [1996] 3\u00a0SLR(R) 605 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis>\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">What follows is a brief elaboration of the legal proposition made above, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, that the correct order to be made if a wife\u2019s legal right to maintenance is sought to be preserved is not an order of \u201cno order\u201d but, instead, one for nominal maintenance.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The correct order to be made in a situation where a wife\u2019s legal right to maintenance is sought to be preserved</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It might be apposite to begin with the Judge\u2019s own observations as well as approach in the present case, which are encapsulated within the following paragraphs of the GD (at [39]\u2013[41]):</Text>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>39</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the issue of maintenance of the wife, the wife submitted that all she wanted was a nominal sum of $1 in order to preserve her rights in the event anything untoward happens to her in the future. The wife referred to <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok v Loh Kum Yong</Emphasis> [1996] 3\u00a0SLR(R) 605 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok</Emphasis>\u201d) in which the Court of Appeal held that the court could not vary the maintenance order under s\u00a0112 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1985 Rev Ed) (now s\u00a0118 of the present WC) if there was no subsisting order for maintenance. The husband submitted that she should get no maintenance.</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>40</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Given that the wife was earning a good salary and she only wanted nominal maintenance to preserve her right for maintenance in the future should the need arise, I decided for pragmatic reasons that it was not necessary to order nominal maintenance merely to preserve her rights to maintenance in future. To achieve this end, I indicated that this would not preclude her from applying for maintenance in the future should there be a need for her to do so. Thus I made no order as regards her maintenance. I am aware that the Court of Appeal in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok</Emphasis> made the following observations (at [15]):</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">If an application for maintenance is dismissed as in this case, there is no <Emphasis type=\"i\">subsisting</Emphasis> order for maintenance for the court to vary and s\u00a0112 has no application. A pre-condition to the operation of s\u00a0112 is the existence of a maintenance order: see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Mills v Mills</Emphasis> [1940] P\u00a0124 and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Stephen v Stephen</Emphasis> [1931] P\u00a0197. Consequently, if the order below stands the wife will be precluded forever from applying to court for maintenance. Thus, to retain the wife\u2019s right to maintenance in the future, a nominal order should have been made so that an application may be made subsequently to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to vary the maintenance order.</Text>\n          </Quote>\n        </QuoteList>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>41</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In that case, the court below dismissed the wife\u2019s application for maintenance as she had the financial resources. This caused the Court of Appeal to hold that in the future the court could not vary the maintenance order under s\u00a0112 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1985 Rev Ed) as there was no subsisting order for maintenance to vary. In the instant case, should the wife require maintenance in the future, she can apply for a fresh maintenance order under s\u00a0113 of the present WC and not a variation of a maintenance order. Hence her right to maintenance had been preserved and <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok</Emphasis> was not applicable as I did not dismiss her application for maintenance and merely made no order for maintenance.</Text>\n          </Item>\n        </QuoteList>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It will be seen from the observations quoted in the preceding paragraph that the Judge had, with respect, missed a crucial point in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis>. Whilst he correctly pointed out that, on the <Emphasis type=\"i\">facts</Emphasis> of that case, the court could not vary the maintenance order in favour of the wife simply because there was no subsisting order for maintenance to vary, he had, with respect, missed the further observation by this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis> to the effect that if a court wished to preserve the wife\u2019s legal right to maintenance for the future, then the correct order to make would be one for <Emphasis type=\"i\">nominal maintenance</Emphasis>. This was the (normative) proposition which would apply in <Emphasis type=\"i\">future</Emphasis> cases where the court is of the view that a wife\u2019s legal right to maintenance ought to be preserved. <Emphasis type=\"i\">Correlatively</Emphasis>, an order <Emphasis type=\"i\">rejecting</Emphasis> the wife\u2019s application for maintenance would, as this court also pointed out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis>, entail the wife being \u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">precluded forever</Emphasis> from applying to court for maintenance\u201d (at [15]) [emphasis added]. At this particular juncture, it would, in our view, be apposite to set out the relevant observations by this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis> in full as follows (at [13]\u2013[15]):</Text>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>13</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n              <Emphasis type=\"bi\">The learned judge </Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"biul\">refused</Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"bi\"> to award</Emphasis> to the wife any maintenance and his main reason was that there was evidence showing that the wife has financial resources. He said ([11] <Emphasis type=\"i\">supra</Emphasis> at [27]):</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">There was evidence to show that after leaving the marriage she lived in a rented flat and owned a luxury car. There were entries in her bank statements showing that she received a total amount of some $500,000 during the last four years. She did not voluntarily reveal the receipt of the funds. After she was compelled to reveal them she gave no satisfactory explanation of the source of the moneys. She said she had borrowed moneys but offered no proof that they were loans. It appeared to be an effort to deliberately conceal her resources. I therefore hold that she failed to make out her case for maintenance by her former husband. She, of course, is not precluded from making a fresh application should there be radical change in the circumstances in the future.</Text>\n          </Quote>\n        </QuoteList>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>14</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n              <Emphasis type=\"biul\">It was pointed out by counsel for the wife </Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"i\">that the learned judge </Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"biul\">was wrong</Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"bi\"> in saying that the wife </Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"biul\">could subsequently make an application for maintenance should there be a material change in the circumstances</Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"bi\">. </Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"biul\">We agree with counsel entirely</Emphasis>\n              <Emphasis type=\"bi\">.</Emphasis> Section\u00a0107 of the Women\u2019s Charter provides that the court \u201cmay order a man to pay maintenance to his wife or former wife \u2026 when granting or subsequent to the grant of a decree of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage.\u201d In this case, the wife\u2019s application for maintenance was heard and an order was made <Emphasis type=\"biul\">refusing</Emphasis> her any maintenance, and that order disposed of her application entirely. <Emphasis type=\"biul\">She is not entitled thereafter to make a fresh application</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">.</Emphasis> The provision that enables a husband or a wife to come to court again on the issue of maintenance is s\u00a0112 of the Women\u2019s Charter which provides:</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance, whether secured or unsecured, on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made, or, in respect of secured maintenance, of the legal personal representatives of the latter, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.</Text>\n          </Quote>\n        </QuoteList>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>15</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n              <Emphasis type=\"bi\">If</Emphasis> an application for maintenance is <Emphasis type=\"biul\">dismissed </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">as in this case</Emphasis>, there is <Emphasis type=\"bi\">no </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"i\">subsisting</Emphasis> order for maintenance for the court to vary and s\u00a0112 has no application.

In particular, these observations were made in relation to the <Emphasis type=\"i\">refusal</Emphasis> by the trial judge to grant the wife\u2019s application for maintenance (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok v Loh Kum Yong</Emphasis> [1996] 1\u00a0SLR(R) 130). Put simply, he had <Emphasis type=\"i\">rejected</Emphasis> the wife\u2019s application and, <Emphasis type=\"i\">more importantly</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis type=\"i\">legal effect or result</Emphasis> of that rejection (in <Emphasis type=\"i\">this court\u2019s</Emphasis> view on appeal) was that the wife concerned was \u201cprecluded forever\u201d from applying to court for maintenance (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis> at [15]; see also at [14]). <Emphasis type=\"bi\">This was precisely why this court in </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"b\">Tan Bee Giok (CA) </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">was at pains to emphasise that, if the court concerned was minded to </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">preserve</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\"> a wife\u2019s right to maintenance in the future, it should make </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">an order for nominal maintenance </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">instead</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"b\">.</Emphasis> However, the Judge in the present case decided <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> to make an order for nominal maintenance but made <Emphasis type=\"bi\">no order</Emphasis> on the Wife\u2019s application for maintenance <Emphasis type=\"i\">instead</Emphasis>. He was of the view that such an order did not preclude the Wife from making an application to the court for maintenance in the future should the need arise. <Emphasis type=\"bi\">Put simply, what the Judge was doing, in </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">substance</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">, was to </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">equate </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">the </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">legal effect or result</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\"> of an order for nominal maintenance with that for an order that there be no order on an application for maintenance.

Put simply, an order that there be no order on an application for maintenance must necessarily constitute <Emphasis type=\"i\">a decision</Emphasis> on that application and cannot, instead, be an order that puts everything in limbo or which \u201csuspends\u201d final judgment on the application, so to speak. That this is indeed the case was recently laid down by this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd v Nordic International Ltd and another</Emphasis> [2015] 2\u00a0SLR 54 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Sinwa (CA)</Emphasis>\u201d). Although the context was slightly different, the point of <Emphasis type=\"i\">general principle</Emphasis> is <Emphasis type=\"i\">equally applicable</Emphasis> to the present case. In that case, the trial judge had decided that there be \u201cno order\u201d on a summary judgment application filed by the appellant (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd v Nordic International Ltd and others</Emphasis> [2014] SGHC 132). In summary, this court held, on appeal, in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Sinwa (CA)</Emphasis>, first, that it was possible for a court hearing a summary judgment application to make \u201cno order\u201d on the application under the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2014 Rev Ed) and, secondly, that there was no right of appeal to the Court of Appeal against such an order under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 2007 Rev Ed). <Emphasis type=\"i\">However</Emphasis> (and in relation to the second point just mentioned), this court was clear that, but for the fact that there was no right of appeal to the Court of Appeal under the relevant legislation, an order to the effect that there was to be \u201cno order\u201d could itself have constituted an \u201corder\u201d from which an appeal was possible because such an order was a <Emphasis type=\"i\">disallowance or rejection</Emphasis> of the application concerned. Steven Chong\u00a0J, who delivered the grounds of decision of the court, observed thus (at [41]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Second, we respectfully disagree with the Judge\u2019s statement that there was no order from which the Appellant could appeal (at [10] of the GD ([21] <Emphasis type=\"i\">supra</Emphasis>)). The Judge\u2019s decision to make no order on the Appellant\u2019s application for summary judgment itself constituted an \u201corder\u201d from which the Appellant could appeal. In the same way that an order of \u201cno order\u201d had legal effect from the date it was made, it must equally be capable of being the subject matter of an appeal provided that the right of appeal is available. This point was dealt with in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tohru Motobayashi</Emphasis> at [15] where this court held that the effect of \u201cno order\u201d made by the Judicial Commissioner below was that he had disallowed the application and there was no reason why an appeal did not lie from this part of the order. There is no right of appeal from the Judge\u2019s decision in making \u201cno order\u201d in respect of the Appellant\u2019s summary judgment application, not because there is no order from which to appeal, but because such an order, on a purposive interpretation, is caught by s\u00a034(1)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>) and para\u00a0(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>) of the Fourth Schedule to the SCJA, which provides that certain orders made are non-appealable to the Court of Appeal.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"9\" pID=\"p1_9\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the avoidance of doubt, we would like to consider briefly two recent local High Court cases where certain views were expressed (albeit in <Emphasis type=\"i\">obiter dicta</Emphasis>) which do not, in our respectful view, represent the correct legal position in so far as this particular issue is concerned.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The first is the decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ v ANK</Emphasis> [2014] SGHC 189 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ (HC)</Emphasis>\u201d). Although this decision in fact applied <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis> in granting nominal maintenance, the judge did nevertheless proceed to observe (at [30]) that \u201c[w]hile I accept that it is not logical to maintain a distinction between nil maintenance and $1 maintenance a month, the said Court of Appeal decision [in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis>] appears to be good law still\u201d. As we have already noted above, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis> is indeed good law. We also explained that it is undergirded by <Emphasis type=\"i\">a substantive conceptual and principled basis</Emphasis> which goes beyond the mere (and literal) figures. In this regard, we would observe for completeness that, on appeal of <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ (HC)</Emphasis> to this court, the judge\u2019s order granting nominal maintenance to the wife was also not interfered with (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ v ANK</Emphasis> [2015] SGCA 34 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ (CA)</Emphasis>\u201d) at [44]). Implicit in that decision, therefore, was that the court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ (CA)</Emphasis> continued (as we do) to regard <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA)</Emphasis> as still being good law.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"11\" pID=\"p1_11\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The second decision is <Emphasis type=\"i\">ADB v ADC</Emphasis> [2014] SGHC 76 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">ADB\u201d</Emphasis>). The judge there dismissed the wife\u2019s claim for maintenance for herself by making \u201cno order for maintenance\u201d which, he explained, had the effect of disallowing her from ever seeking maintenance from the husband (at [9]). However, it is important for present purposes to note that the judge also observed in <Emphasis type=\"i\">obiter dicta</Emphasis> that if, instead, it was thought necessary to preserve a wife\u2019s right to maintenance in the future, then the appropriate order to make was an order that there be \u201cno maintenance for the time being with liberty to apply\u201d(at [8]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In some cases, courts have awarded a token $1 monthly maintenance, presumably with a view to \u201cpreserve\u201d the wife\u2019s right to maintenance. In my view, this token gesture is unnecessary because s\u00a0118 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 2009 Rev Ed) permits the wife (and husband) to apply for a variation or rescission of the maintenance order at any time. <Emphasis type=\"bi\">Thus, an order that there be </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"biul\">no maintenance for the time being with liberty to apply</Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\"> would have sufficed to preserve the parties\u2019 rights.</Emphasis> In any event, should it be thought that technically a token sum should be awarded (in case a husband should subsequently argue that the court cannot vary a \u201c0\u201d sum), then it becomes important to appreciate the distinction between an order for no maintenance and one for no maintenance but with liberty to apply. Not only does s\u00a0118 refer to a variation of the maintenance order and not the maintenance sum, but even in terms of mathematics, a \u201c0\u201d is also a number. [emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">With respect, the observations quoted in the preceding paragraph centre, once again, upon the mere (and literal) figures. The formula suggested (that there be an order for no maintenance but with liberty to apply) is also somewhat cumbersome. More importantly, however, and in avoiding the danger of the literalness just referred to, this particular formula appears to comprise two limbs. The first is, in substance, an order that there be \u201cno order\u201d with regard to a wife\u2019s application for maintenance. As we have already elaborated upon above, such an order is, in substance as well as effect, a <Emphasis type=\"i\">rejection or disallowance</Emphasis> of the wife\u2019s application, thus <Emphasis type=\"i\">precluding her from ever claiming maintenance again</Emphasis>. In <Emphasis type=\"i\">those</Emphasis> circumstances, the second limb (which is a liberty to apply) would <Emphasis type=\"i\">have nothing to apply to</Emphasis>. This is because it is settled law that the \u201cliberty to apply\u201d order is only intended to <Emphasis type=\"i\">supplement</Emphasis> the main orders of the court in form and convenience so that the main orders may be carried out and may not be used to <Emphasis type=\"i\">vary</Emphasis> the order of the court (see the local High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Anwar Siraj and another v Teo Hee Lai Building Construction Pte Ltd</Emphasis> [2014] 1\u00a0SLR 52 at [47] and the cases cited therein). In other words, because the \u201cliberty to apply\u201d proviso seeks only to enable the working out of the main orders of the court, it is necessarily devoid of any meaning and effect when there is, in substance, no main order from which reference can be taken in the first place. However, that, as we have explained, is precisely the effect of the first limb in the formula proposed in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ADB</Emphasis>.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the reasons set out above (and, in particular, having regard to the recent decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Sinwa (CA)</Emphasis>), it is clear that, in order to preserve a wife\u2019s right to apply for maintenance to the court in the future, an order of <Emphasis type=\"i\">nominal maintenance</Emphasis> is required. In this regard, an order that there be \u201cno order\u201d will not suffice as it is, in substance, a rejection or disallowance of the Wife\u2019s application for maintenance which would \u2013 as stated by this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Bee Giok (CA) \u2013</Emphasis> prevent the Wife from ever applying for maintenance thereafter.</Text>\n      </Para>\n    </Judgment>\n

The Judge\u2019s grounds of decision may be found at <Emphasis type=\"i\">Thery Patrice Roger v Tan Chye Tee</Emphasis> [2013] SGHC 191 (\u201cthe GD\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Background</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"2\" pID=\"p1_2\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The parties were married on 20\u00a0July 1991. The husband is a 68\u00a0year old retiree. He drew a monthly salary of $5,000 as an employee of a defence sales consultancy company before he retired in 2003. The wife is a 58\u00a0year old freelance trainer and draws a salary of between $4,000 and $7,000 a month.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The parties have two children, a son aged 26 and a daughter aged 24.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The wife commenced divorce proceedings on 14\u00a0July 2010 and interim judgment was granted on 31\u00a0May 2011.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The purchase and sale of the matrimonial homes</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The parties\u2019 first matrimonial home was an apartment at 235\u00a0Tembeling Road (\u201cthe Katong Gardens property\u201d). It was purchased in 1991 for $590,000 and sold on 6\u00a0March 2007 for $980,000. Approximately two weeks before the Katong Gardens property was sold, the parties purchased their second matrimonial home, a landed property at Loyang View, for $728,000 (\u201cthe Loyang View property\u201d). As the sale of the Katong Gardens property was only completed after the purchase of the Loyang View property, the wife took three loans from United Overseas Bank Limited (\u201cUOB\u201d) to finance the purchase of the latter property: (a)\u00a0a Hi-Plus loan of $509,600 (\u201cthe Hi-Plus Loan\u201d); (b)\u00a0a bridging loan of $36,400 (\u201cthe Bridging Loan\u201d); and (c)\u00a0a short-term loan of $145,600 (\u201cthe Short-Term Loan\u201d). The Bridging Loan and the Short-Term Loan were later repaid in full out of the sale proceeds of the Katong Gardens property. The sale proceeds of the Katong Gardens property were deposited into the wife\u2019s UOB HomePlus account.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In August 2010, the Loyang View property was sold for $1,080,000.

In so doing, she rejected the husband\u2019s claim that he alone had been servicing the mortgage repayments for the Katong Gardens property because it was not supported by any documentary evidence, save for a letter of offer and two other documents from Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (\u201cOCBC\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"8\" pID=\"p1_8\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">After a consideration of the parties\u2019 other financial and non-financial contributions, the Judge concluded that the wife was entitled to 90% of the sale proceeds of the Loyang View property.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"9\" pID=\"p1_9\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge drew an adverse inference against the husband in the light of his deliberate non-disclosure and dissipation of assets.

This was not seriously disputed by counsel for the wife, Mr\u00a0Koh Tien Hua (\u201cMr\u00a0Koh\u201d), at the hearing before us. Although there was no direct documentary evidence of the husband\u2019s mortgage repayments, the husband exhibited a letter of offer from OCBC setting out the terms of the housing loan and the term loan in November 2002.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_6\">6</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_6\" label=\"6\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">ACB(B), pp\u00a018-19.</Text></Para></Footnote> Counsel for the husband, Mr\u00a0S\u00a0Magintharan (\u201cMr\u00a0Magintharan\u201d), explained at the hearing before us that the additional term loan was for the running of the parties\u2019 business. This was again not disputed by Mr\u00a0Koh. Apart from the letter of offer, there were two statements of account from OCBC dated 31\u00a0December 2005 which stated the outstanding amounts on the housing loan and the term loan.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_7\">7</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_7\" label=\"7\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">RA Vol 3 (Pt\u00a0C), pp\u00a0135-136.</Text></Para></Footnote></Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Mr\u00a0Koh argues in his written submissions that the husband\u2019s claim to have paid for the mortgage instalments should be rejected because the sums \u201cdo not tally\u201d. Specifically, he argues that the outstanding amount on the term loan at completion should have been $177,230.72 based on the terms in the letter of offer. However, he points out that the outstanding amount on the loan at completion was in fact $225,784.35.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The difficulty we have with Mr\u00a0Koh\u2019s submission is that it fails to include the housing loan of $56,500.

The minor discrepancy between $233,170.72 and the actual figure of $225,784.35 is likely to be attributable to the variable interest charged on the housing loan and the term loan (see cll\u00a01(d) and 2(c) of the OCBC letter of offer).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In so far as the indirect financial contributions of the parties are concerned, we are of the view that the wife was largely responsible for the payment of property tax and condominium maintenance fees on the Katong Gardens property.

However, these were not the amounts that were eventually credited to the parties as their financial contributions to the Loyang View property. We will elaborate upon the reasons for this below.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"22\" pID=\"p1_22\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Before we turn to the assessment of the parties\u2019 contributions to the Loyang View property, there are two points that we should clarify.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">First, the determination of the parties\u2019 financial contributions to the Katong Gardens property above is necessary in order to achieve a fair and equitable division of the sale proceeds from the Loyang View property. As mentioned earlier, the wife took three loans from UOB to finance the purchase of the Loyang View property and the sale proceeds from the Katong Gardens property were then used to repay these three loans. It would have been an impossible task to determine the appropriate credit to be given to the parties for the three loans without reference to their contributions to the Katong Gardens property. It would have also been patently inequitable if the wife were credited with the <Emphasis type=\"i\">entire</Emphasis> quantum of the three loans. Therefore, a consideration of the parties\u2019 contributions to the first matrimonial home is necessary on the present facts.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Secondly, we find it inappropriate to determine the parties\u2019 <Emphasis type=\"i\">non-financial</Emphasis> contributions to the Katong Gardens property as at the date of the sale of that property because they should be \u201cassessed and applied at the <Emphasis type=\"i\">end</Emphasis> of the marriage\u201d [emphasis in original], with a full appreciation of the entire context and circumstances of the marriage (see the decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">AYQ v AYR and another matter</Emphasis> [2013] 1\u00a0SLR 476 at [23]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Whether the Judge erred in arriving at a 90:10 division of the sale proceeds of the Loyang View property in favour of the wife</Heading>\n      <Heading level=\"4\" align=\"left\">The three loans</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"25\" pID=\"p1_25\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As mentioned above (at [5]), the wife took out three loans from UOB to finance the purchase of the Loyang View property before the sale of the Katong Gardens property was complete. The two smaller loans, <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the Bridging Loan and Short-Term Loan, were fully repaid soon after the sale of the Katong Gardens property in July 2007.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_21\">21</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_21\" label=\"21\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">RA Vol\u00a03 (Pt\u00a0E), p\u00a0256.</Text></Para></Footnote> Since these two loans were repaid out of the sale proceeds of the Katong Gardens property, we credit the parties with the repayment of these two loans in the same 74.2:25.8 proportion ascertained above (at [21]). This works out to be $135,044 and $46,956 for the husband and wife, respectively.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"26\" pID=\"p1_26\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Unfortunately, ascertaining the parties\u2019 respective contributions towards the repayment of the third loan, <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the Hi-Plus Loan, is not as straightforward due to the long period of repayment via instalments as well as the various transactions made by the wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The total amount borrowed under the Hi-Plus Loan was $509,600. After an initial payment of $154,140 was made towards repayment of the loan from the wife\u2019s CPF account, the outstanding amount on the loan was approximately $355,460. We note here that the wife could have used the sale proceeds from the Katong Gardens property, which amounted to $375,713.98, to pay off the outstanding amount on the Hi-Plus Loan. Instead, she chose to repay the loan in monthly instalments from her UOB HomePlus account where the sale proceeds from the Katong Gardens property had been deposited. This method of repayment naturally incurred interest which formed a component of the monthly instalments made by the wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"28\" pID=\"p1_28\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It is apposite at this point to mention two other transactions executed by the wife.

In that scenario, only a negligible amount of interest would have been incurred and there would have been no outstanding amount owed on the loan upon the sale of the Loyang View property. It would also have been straightforward for this court to have credited the parties with the repayment of the loan in the same 74.2:25.8 proportion as the first two loans. We mention this only to illustrate that the wife had enjoyed a substantial financial benefit from her arrangement of the parties\u2019 financial affairs with UOB as set out above. In particular, the wife\u2019s decision to pay the loan in instalments gave her the flexibility of withdrawing a considerable sum of money, <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, a net amount of $133,000 (see above at [28]), at a later point in time for an undisclosed purpose. It also gave her the financial wherewithal to make instalment payments amounting to $42,848.39 on an additional loan that she had taken out for the benefit of her niece (see above at [29]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"32\" pID=\"p1_32\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the circumstances, we think that it is just and equitable to credit the husband with $263,612.12. This is the entire amount that was repaid on the Hi-Plus Loan. We should mention that this figure is marginally lower than the sum of $278,779.77 that the husband would have been credited with if the entire sale proceeds of the Katong Gardens property had been used at the outset to repay the Hi-Plus Loan (see above at [21]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"4\" align=\"left\">The indirect financial contributions</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"33\" pID=\"p1_33\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The wife\u2019s contributions towards the legal fees and the stamp fees for the property were not disputed by the husband.<FootnoteRef ftnIDRef=\"Ftn_30\">30</FootnoteRef><Footnote ftnID=\"Ftn_30\" label=\"30\"><Para indent=\"none\"><Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">AC at [21].</Text></Para></Footnote> In so far as the renovation expenses are concerned, we do not think that there is any reason to interfere with the Judge\u2019s finding that the wife had paid for these expenses.

Upon completion, the wife was supposed to have transferred $166,694.82 back into her CPF account (the difference of $12,554.82 being accrued interest).

On the contrary, we think that the amount refunded to the wife\u2019s CPF account (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, $111,879) should be <Emphasis type=\"i\">included</Emphasis> in the net sale proceeds for division because the wife has already been credited for her initial CPF contribution of $154,140 (see above at [34]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"41\" pID=\"p1_41\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In so far as the sum of $80,151.61 was concerned, this was the amount outstanding on the $123,000 term loan taken by the wife when the Loyang View property was sold (see above at [29]). The wife admits that this loan is not a matrimonial debt. Since $80,151.61 was paid to UOB on completion of the sale of the Loyang View property, a corresponding amount was deducted from the net sale proceeds. Therefore, this amount should be added back to the sale proceeds for division.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">The remaining issues</Heading>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">The other matrimonial assets</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"42\" pID=\"p1_42\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge ordered each party to retain their own assets.

This consideration of each party\u2019s share of the matrimonial assets when deciding the appropriate award of maintenance is permitted by the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 2009\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d) (see, in particular, s\u00a0114(1)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>) of the Act).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"47\" pID=\"p1_47\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Therefore, we affirm the Judge\u2019s award of $70,000 to the wife as lump sum maintenance.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Whether the Judge erred in awarding maintenance of $50,450 for the son\u2019s education</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"48\" pID=\"p1_48\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Mr\u00a0Magintharan submits that the Judge erred in awarding maintenance for the son.

Since the son was already 25\u00a0years old when ancillary hearing took place, he should have applied for maintenance personally.

We also think that the wife is not in a position to apply for the son\u2019s maintenance on his behalf under s\u00a069(3)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">a</Emphasis>) because it cannot reasonably be said that she is a \u201cguardian\u201d or in \u201cactual custody\u201d of her 25\u00a0year old son. In any case, we are unable to uphold the order of maintenance for the son\u2019s education based on the evidence before us. The son failed to state on affidavit that he was enrolled in a course at the Kaplan Higher Education Institute. Nor did he provide on affidavit details of the expenses incurred in studying at the institute. Under these circumstances, we think that the Judge, with respect, erred in awarding maintenance for the son in the sum of $50,450.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Whether the Judge erred in awarding maintenance of $19,466.38 for the daughter\u2019s education</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"51\" pID=\"p1_51\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Mr\u00a0Magintharan argues in this particular regard that the wife had failed to produce any evidence with respect to the university course fees or the actual amounts paid by her.

In the present appeal, the Appellant appealed only against the Judge\u2019s orders relating to the division of the pool of matrimonial assets and maintenance for herself and the Children. No appeal was made in so far as the custody and care arrangements were concerned.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Appellant also filed Summons No\u00a04696 of 2012 on 17\u00a0September 2012 in order to adduce additional evidence before this court (\u201cthe new evidence\u201d), comprising the following (in relation to her recent diagnosis of and treatment for breast cancer): the Appellant\u2019s Histopathology Report, the medical certification of her treatment, her Medical Report, copies of her medical receipts as well as her clinic\u2019s sales summary from March 2012 to September 2012. The new evidence might, if admitted, have impacted the issue of maintenance (both with regard to herself as well as her (percentage) contribution to the maintenance of the Children). Counsel for the Husband (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d), Mr\u00a0Imran Hamid Khwaja (\u201cMr\u00a0Imran\u201d), helpfully stated that his client had no objection to the adducing of the new evidence but would make submissions with regard to such evidence. This was, in our view, an eminently fair approach to take. We were, in any event, minded to and eventually did admit such evidence based on the applicable legal principles.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">After hearing submissions from counsel for both parties, we dismissed the appeal with regard to the issue of maintenance, albeit with liberty to the Appellant and with the appropriate evidence to apply to the court below for a variation of the maintenance order(s). In so far as the issue relating to the division of the pool of matrimonial assets was concerned, we confirmed the classification method adopted by the Judge. However, we varied the percentage of indirect contributions by the Appellant which we felt ought to be allotted a 30%\u00a0weightage in each of the three asset classes. In the circumstances, the Appellant was awarded 49% (instead of 39%) of the net sales proceeds of the matrimonial home, 30% (instead of 5%) of the Respondent\u2019s share of the Australian house sale proceeds, and 40% (instead of 20%) of the other matrimonial assets (the original orders made by the Judge are also reproduced below at [8]). Viewed from an overall perspective, the Appellant\u2019s share of the entire pool of matrimonial assets amounted to 40.96%, whilst the Respondent\u2019s share amounted to 59.03%. We would like to take the opportunity to emphasise once again that the court\u2019s task, pursuant to s\u00a0112 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cs\u00a0112\u201d), is to arrive at a \u201cjust and equitable\u201d division of the entire pool of matrimonial assets. In this regard, we were of the view that the division made in the present case, as reflected by the respective final overall percentages, did in fact achieve such a result when viewed in the round as well. In the circumstances, we also found it appropriate to make no order as to the costs of the appeal (a similar order, incidentally, having also been made by the Judge in the court below).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We now give the detailed grounds for our decision and also take the opportunity to clarify the role of indirect contributions (particularly with regard to \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d first referred to by this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">NK v NL</Emphasis> [2007] 3\u00a0SLR(R) 743 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">NK v NL</Emphasis>\u201d)).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Brief background</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">By way of brief background, the Appellant is presently 51\u00a0years old whilst the Respondent is 53\u00a0years old.

Counsel for the Appellant, Mr\u00a0Tito Isaac (\u201cMr\u00a0Isaac\u201d), submitted that his client was not disputing the specific valuation amounts of the various assets making up the pool of matrimonial assets but that the dispute was only with the percentage of matrimonial assets awarded to her. In this regard, he submitted that an appropriate award for his client ought to be 45% of all matrimonial assets. In support of this, Mr\u00a0Isaac proffered two specific arguments.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">First, Mr\u00a0Isaac argued that the Judge ought to have used \u201cthe global assessment methodology\u201d, and not \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d, so as to achieve a just and equitable division of the pool of matrimonial assets. He argued that, in applying \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d, the Judge had not given due consideration to her indirect contributions, such as homemaking and child caring, to each class of asset. In particular, Mr\u00a0Isaac pointed out that the Judge had only attributed 20% of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home to her indirect contributions and was silent as to her indirect contributions as regards the remaining two classes of matrimonial assets (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, the Australian house and the other matrimonial assets).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Secondly, Mr\u00a0Isaac argued that the Judge should have used a broad-brush approach in the division of the pool of matrimonial assets and that he had erred in considering irrelevant considerations while failing to consider relevant ones. He argued that the Judge in finding that the Appellant had an increased interest in her social life, placed excessive emphasis on the findings of the private investigator report submitted by the Respondent resulting in his discounting of her indirect contributions as the Children\u2019s primary caregiver and his failure to appreciate the \u201ctrue\u201d reason for her departure from the matrimonial home.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">The Respondent\u2019s arguments</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Turning to the Respondent\u2019s arguments, in so far as the Appellant\u2019s first argument was concerned, Mr\u00a0Imran submitted that \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d used by the Judge was appropriate. He added that an appropriate reading of this court\u2019s statement in <Emphasis type=\"i\">NK v NL</Emphasis> (at [35]) that \u201c[t]he element of indirect contributions ... must necessarily remain constant in relation to each class of asset\u201d under \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d ought to be understood as the fact of indirect contributions in each asset class being constant but that the extent of such contributions may vary. As such, he disagreed with the Appellant\u2019s argument that her indirect contributions were not given due consideration, because, as he submitted, the Judge did consider and award her a proportion of the assets in each class which duly reflected the extent of the indirect contributions on her part. Mr\u00a0Imran added that the Appellant herself appeared to accept \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d as being appropriate at the ancillary hearing below.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"15\" pID=\"p1_15\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In so far as the Appellant\u2019s second argument was concerned, Mr\u00a0Imran argued that the Judge did consider and did not discount the Appellant\u2019s indirect contributions. This was reflected at [21]\u2013[22] of the GD, and also his (the Judge\u2019s) finding that the Appellant was the Children\u2019s primary caregiver and that she had made career sacrifices accordingly (see the GD at [25]). In addition, Mr\u00a0Imran suggested that the extent of the Appellant\u2019s indirect contributions had to be appreciated in the context of her preference for a social lifestyle which was seen in the evidence placed before the Judge. On the reason for the Appellant leaving the matrimonial home, the Respondent disagreed that this was due to violence on his part and pointed out that the Judge in fact did not make such a finding as to the reason for this. Finally, Mr\u00a0Imran submitted that the Judge did, in fact, use the broad-brush approach in dividing the matrimonial assets, this being clear from a reading of the GD itself.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Our decision</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"16\" pID=\"p1_16\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We do not think that counsel were at odds in so far as the basic propositions of law were concerned (including the fundamental proposition that the court will adopt a broad-brush approach towards the division of the pool of matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112). The focal difference appeared to us to centre around, first, whether \u201cthe global assessment methodology\u201d or \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d ought to be applied and, secondly, assuming (as the Judge did) that the latter methodology applied, whether or not <Emphasis type=\"i\">indirect contributions</Emphasis> ought to be accorded the same weight in relation to each class of assets.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Turning first to the methodology that ought to be adopted, it is clear that there are no rules that are writ in stone.

In this regard, four interrelated issues bear clarification. Before proceeding to consider these issues, it should be noted that the decision in this appeal itself illustrates the <Emphasis type=\"i\">dynamic interaction</Emphasis> between these two methodologies and (more importantly) the fact that <Emphasis type=\"bi\">neither methodology is superior to the other. In the final analysis, the facts and circumstances of the case at hand are of primary importance. Further, regardless of the methodology adopted, the paramount aim is to ensure that the matrimonial assets concerned are divided in a</Emphasis> just and equitable<Emphasis type=\"bi\"> manner (as aptly laid down in s\u00a0112(1) of the Act itself). The court should apply the methodology that leads to this result.</Emphasis> [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">And, in a similar vein, the court proceeded to observe thus (at [36]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"i\">Regardless of which approach is adopted, a holistic assessment of all the circumstances of the case must be undertaken.

The final decision ... must remain governed by the \u201cjust and equitable\u201d formula. [emphasis added]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In our view, the Judge was justified in adopting \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d as the various matrimonial assets did lend themselves to classification under the three headings adopted in the court below, <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the sale proceeds of the Singapore matrimonial home, the sale proceeds from the Respondent\u2019s share of the Australian house and the matrimonial assets (not arising from the sale of real property). However, what engendered more difficulty was the fact that the Judge appeared to accord different weights to the Appellant\u2019s indirect contributions with regard to each class of assets. This was particularly marked in relation to the Australian property, where the Judge held as follows (see the GD at [34]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">I found that the wife had not proved her direct financial contributions for the Australia house. She did not adduce any documentary evidence and it was unlikely that she contributed to the payment of any monthly instalment. The property was bought by the husband and his sister. For the first two years after the Australia house was bought, the wife remained in Singapore while the husband resided in Australia. Further, the parties did not live in the Australia house even when the wife joined the husband in Australia subsequently. In the circumstances I found it hard to accept the wife\u2019s word that she had helped to pay for the mortgage. <Emphasis type=\"i\">There was also hardly any evidence as to how her indirect contributions had assisted the husband to acquire the Australia house. Nevertheless, the Australia house was technically part of matrimonial assets because it was acquired by the husband after the parties were married. In the circumstances, I awarded the wife 5% of the $533,122.52</Emphasis>, ie<Emphasis type=\"i\">, $26,656.13.</Emphasis> [emphasis added]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"20\" pID=\"p1_20\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It was clear, in our view, that the Judge did not sufficiently take into account the indirect contributions of the Appellant with regard to this particular asset. With respect, this is contrary to the following observations of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">NK v NL</Emphasis> (at [35]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">To begin with, it must be emphasised that, pursuant to \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d, only the direct contributions may vary<Emphasis type=\"i\">. </Emphasis><Emphasis type=\"bi\">The element of indirect contributions in the context of homemaking and child caring must necessarily remain constant in relation to each class of asset.</Emphasis> On this note, it would seem that this (classification) approach would be appropriate where there are multiple classes of assets, and where the parties have made different contributions. Without prejudicing the broad discretion conferred by the Act, it would appear in this instance that it might be more principled and conducive to a fair and equitable division to consider the assets in classes, taking into account the differing financial contributions, rather than as a vast conglomerate of assets. In the vast majority of other cases, however, <Emphasis type=\"i\">either</Emphasis> approach would likely achieve the same result. [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"21\" pID=\"p1_21\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We would observe \u2013 parenthetically \u2013 that, pursuant to \u201cthe global assessment methodology\u201d, the role of indirect contributions would, of course, be taken into account and, by the very nature of the methodology itself, only once at that.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"22\" pID=\"p1_22\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Returning to \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d, we would emphasise the fact that indirect contributions must be factored into \u2013 and its weightage to remain constant in relation to \u2013 each class of assets. That there might be some confusion at present not only with regard to the present appeal but also with regard to other cases in which on occasion judges rightly hold that the weightage of indirect contributions ought to remain constant with regard to each class of assets (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">AJR v AJS</Emphasis> [2010] 4\u00a0SLR\u00a0617 (at [21])) while on other occasions they appear to treat its weightage as differing as between asset classes (see, for example, the Singapore District Court decision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">BAA v BAB</Emphasis> [2012]\u00a0SGDC\u00a0193 (at [26])), merely underscores the need for the clarification which we have just made.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Indeed, by their <Emphasis type=\"i\">very nature</Emphasis>, indirect contributions are part of the very warp and woof of the <Emphasis type=\"i\">entire</Emphasis> marriage and must therefore be reflected consistently throughout each class of assets. To hold otherwise would, in our view, be contrary to this approach and would invariably lead to undesirable anomalies. If, as was the case here with regard to the Australian property, the asset concerned was acquired by, for example, a husband very shortly after the marriage, there would, <Emphasis type=\"i\">ex hypothesi</Emphasis>, be little or no indirect contributions by his wife which could be taken into account when that particular asset is being considered by the court with regard to division between the parties pursuant to s\u00a0112. Simply put, the anomaly would be that for matrimonial assets acquired very early on in the marriage, for instance immediately after the marriage, the indirect contributions concerned would more likely than not be given very little weight. In contrast, for matrimonial assets acquired later on during the marriage, the indirect contributions concerned would likely be accorded heftier weight. However, the fallacy in such an approach is the fact that indirect contributions can only be assessed and applied at the <Emphasis type=\"i\">end</Emphasis> of the marriage and, by their very nature, <Emphasis type=\"i\">relate back and impact the entire marriage to date.</Emphasis> The court\u2019s assessment of a spouse\u2019s indirect contribution should thus be performed with retrospective lenses, looking back and fully appreciating the entire context and circumstances of the marriage. It should not be done in a time-specific manner, <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, assessing the extent of indirect contributions of a spouse as at that specific point in time when a particular matrimonial asset was acquired. Further, this assessment should not be done in a blinkered fashion where the court focuses on each individual class of assets and decides the weightage of a spouse\u2019s indirect contribution as regards that particular asset class, resulting in a situation where varying weights are accorded for indirect contributions in different matrimonial asset classes. This approach would accord with the view of the marital enterprise being a partnership of efforts of both spouses and that, during the course of marriage, the spouses contribute to the betterment of it in ways that they can without consciously accounting with mathematical precision as regards the quantum and type of their respective contributions. In this case then, we thought it just and equitable to attribute what was, in our view, a reasonable weight to indirect contributions by the Appellant in the instant appeal <Emphasis type=\"i\">across all</Emphasis> the classes of assets. We were of the view that a weightage of 30% <Emphasis type=\"i\">vis-a-vis</Emphasis> the Appellant\u2019s indirect contributions would be appropriate, having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the present case (including the length of the marriage as well as the actual contributions and career sacrifices which the Appellant had made) \u2013 which resulted in the apportionment of the various classes of matrimonial assets set out above (at [4]). We should add that we did not think that the Appellant\u2019s allegedly keen interest in her social life was significant when placed in context and certainly would not have warranted any discount of the real efforts and contributions that she had evidently made throughout the course of the marriage.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The approach towards the role of indirect contributions outlined above with regard (especially) to \u201cthe classification methodology\u201d is also consistent with the entire spirit behind this court\u2019s view as to the importance of ensuring that indirect contributions are not undervalued but are (on the contrary) given their appropriate weight in the case at hand. Indeed, as this court observed in <Emphasis type=\"i\">NK v NL</Emphasis> (at [34]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">A related point, which is of special importance where one spouse (often the wife) has devoted his or her entire time to the family over a lengthy period of time, is to ensure that indirect contributions are <Emphasis type=\"i\">not undervalued</Emphasis>. We have dealt with this particular issue recently and reiterate the proposition laid down in that case, as follows (see [<Emphasis type=\"i\">Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</Emphasis> [2007] 3\u00a0SLR(R) 520] <Emphasis type=\"i\">...</Emphasis> at [39]):</Text>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In this regard, we also endorse the following views expressed by Debbie Ong Siew Ling\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Valerie Thean, \u2018Family Law\u2019, (2005) 6\u00a0SAL Ann Rev 259 at para\u00a013.31:</Text>\n            <Quote level=\"3\">\n              <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It could be contended that in most cases where one party experiences great financial success, the other often bears a heavy burden in respect of the children and home; in some cases this entails the sacrifice of any potential for career development.

It is hoped that this would not stand in the way of courts according due regard to the fact that the financial aspect is but one facet of the many demands that husband and wife must have weathered if a family has had many years together.</Text>\n            </Quote>\n          </Quote>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Our examination of the case law shows that the courts might not have given sufficient recognition to the value of factors like homemaking, parenting and husbandry when attributing to them a financial value in the division of matrimonial assets.

It is true that, by their very nature, such kinds of contributions to the marriage are, as pointed out in the quotation above, difficult to measure because they are, intrinsically, incapable of being measured in precise financial terms (we assume that this is what the authors meant when they said that such contributions were impossible to measure). Difficulty in measuring the financial value of such contributions has never been - and ought never to be - an obstacle to giving the spouse concerned his or her just and equitable share of the matrimonial assets that is commensurate with his or her contributions, taking into account (of course) the other relevant contributions and factors.</Text>\n          </Quote>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[emphasis in original]</Text>\n          </Quote>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Issue\u00a02 \u2013 Whether the Appellant\u2019s percentage contribution to the Children\u2019s maintenance ought to be decreased</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"25\" pID=\"p1_25\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We did not think that the Judge had exercised his discretion wrongly in so far as this particular issue was concerned.

Indeed, Mr\u00a0Isaac himself appeared to focus more on the next issue (<Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, Issue 3) \u2013 and, in our view, rightly so in view of our finding that the Judge had not exercised his discretion wrongly in the court below in so far as this particular issue was concerned as the new evidence had not yet been discovered and placed before him.

Mr\u00a0Imran, on the other hand, argued that the new evidence did not disclose any significant drop in the Appellant\u2019s income although he (again, very fairly and correctly, in our view) was prepared to concede that, with sufficient evidence, the Appellant would be entitled to apply for a variation of the current maintenance order in the court below.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"28\" pID=\"p1_28\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Not surprisingly, Mr\u00a0Isaac was unable to explain to this court\u2019s satisfaction how he had arrived at the figure of $2,000 in monthly maintenance and this merely underscored Mr\u00a0Imran\u2019s argument to the effect that there was really insufficient evidence before this court to enable it to arrive at a principled decision. In the circumstances, we were \u2013 as was the case with the previous issue \u2013 of the view that Mr\u00a0Imran\u2019s proposal that the Appellant apply for a variation of this particular maintenance order in the court below was the most appropriate.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"29\" pID=\"p1_29\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the reasons set out above, we arrived at our decisions on the respective issues (which have been set out above at [4]).

The blue travel bag had a huge\n\ntear near its zipper.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">4 After handing over the bags to the\n\nappellant, Lim headed back to the carpark below Block 31 Dover Road while the appellant\n\nreturned to her flat. The appellant brought the two bags into the master bedroom of her\n\nflat, and proceeded to take out its contents which turned out to be eight slabs of opium\n\nwrapped separately in masking tape and weighing a total of some 12kg. The appellant\n\nproceeded to wrap each individual slab of opium neatly with newspapers before placing them\n\none-by-one into separate plastic bags. She then placed the eight plastic bags of opium\n\nslabs under her bed in the master bedroom and pulled the bedspread over so that the bags\n\nwere blocked from view. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">5 Approximately 15 minutes after the\n\nappellant had returned to her flat, a team of Central Narcotics Bureau ('CNB') officers\n\nraided the unit. The appellant opened the door only after the officers had knocked for\n\naround three to four minutes and after one of them had started to cut the padlock on the\n\niron grill outside the front door. Upon entering the flat, W/Cpl Jessilyn Tan Poh Choo\n\n(PW27) ascertained the appellant's particulars while Sgt Ronie Chua (PW22) proceeded to\n\nsecure the premises during which he discovered the plastic bags under the bed in the\n\nmaster bedroom. The following exchange was then recorded by W/Insp Jenny Tan (PW24) as\n\nhaving taken place between the appellant and herself in the master bedroom of the flat:</font></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Q: What are those?<br/>\n\n  A: Opium</font></p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Q: How many?<br/>\n\n  A: 8 slabs</font></p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Q: Belong to who?<br/>\n\n  A: Not mine.</font></p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Q: Why in your room?<br/>\n\n  A: I brought in from outside my home.</font></p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Q: Why you bring them into your home?<br/>\n\n  A: (She refuses to answer the question)</font></p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">6 The appellant was taken back to the CNB\n\nwhere various statements were then taken from her over the course of the next few days.\n\nThese statements, which formed the mainstay of the prosecution's case, were admitted by\n\nthe trial judge in the court below without any challenge as to their voluntariness. We now\n\nset out in brief the gist of each of these statements.</font></p>\n\n<p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code or\n\ncautioned statement (P122)</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">7 This statement was recorded by the\n\ninvestigating officer in the afternoon of 11 April 1999. In this statement, the appellant\n\nstated:</font></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">A Chinese man asked me to keep some\n\n  packets for him. He told me that he would collect the packets from me one or two days\n\n  later. When I took the packets to my master bedroom, I then discovered that the packets\n\n  were opium. I immediately went out of my flat to look for the Chinese man but he had\n\n  already gone. I was thinking whether to call the police or to wait for the Chinese man to\n\n  collect the packets back from me. When the police came, I opened the door and led the\n\n  policemen to my bedroom where the packets were. I do not know the name of this Chinese\n\n  man. I can only recognise him by sight. I do not know why this Chinese man handed these\n\n  packages to me to keep for him. </font></p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The investigation statements </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">P124, recorded on 13 April 1999</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">8 The appellant stated here that she\n\nreceived a page on the night of 10 April 1999. When she called back, a man speaking in\n\nHokkien introduced himself as 'Ah Tan' and claimed that he was a friend of her late\n\nhusband's. He then asked the appellant to keep something for him. She asked him what the\n\nthing was to which he replied that they were just a few packets of things, and did not\n\ndisclose further. The appellant nevertheless agreed to keep the things for him. The next\n\nmorning on 11 April 1999, she received a telephone call from another Chinese man, who told\n\nher that he had the things with him on the ground floor and was coming up to the third\n\nstorey to pass the things to her but that he did not know her unit number. She then told\n\nhim that she would be standing at the door of her flat. Thereafter, the appellant stood\n\noutside her door and saw a Chinese man come up the stairs with a blue bag and a red\n\nplastic bag. The man placed the bags on the floor and then went back down the stairs again\n\nwithout speaking to the appellant.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">9 The appellant took the two bags into the\n\nmaster bedroom of her flat. She detected a strong odour of opium upon which she looked\n\ninto the bags and saw several packets of things wrapped in brown masking tape. She\n\nproceeded to wrap the packets in newspapers and put each packet separately into plastic\n\nbags. She then placed all eight bags under her bed. She then contemplated whether to call\n\nthe police or to wait for Ah Tan to come and collect the packets from her.</font></p>\n\n<p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">P125, recorded on 15 April 1999</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">10 In this statement, the appellant said\n\nthat she had wrapped the packets of opium because the odour emanating from them was\n\nunbearable. After placing the packets under her bed, she waited to see if Ah Tan would\n\ncall her. If he did not call her, she would then tell her sons about the opium when they\n\nwoke up. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">11 The appellant further stated that Ah\n\nTan never called her at home or at her food stall at the Dover Road hawker centre. She\n\nsaid that she had only contacted him once, and that was at the time when she had returned\n\nhis page on the night of 10 April 1999. He had not offered her any payment for her\n\nassistance in storing the things, but did tell her that he would come and collect the\n\npackets from her in a day or two.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">12 When shown a photograph of Henry Tan\n\nKok Hwa, the man later ascertained to be the 'Ah Tan' in question, the appellant\n\nrecognised him as a friend of her late husband's but denied knowing his name as her late\n\nhusband never introduced him to her. She further said that she had never spoken to Henry\n\nTan before. Neither did she know if Henry Tan was the person who had called her. She added\n\nthat Henry Tan never came by her house or stall following her husband's death. </font></p>\n\n<p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">P126, recorded on 21 April 1999</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">13 The appellant said here that Ah Tan had\n\nspoken to her about a week before 10 April 1999. She could not recall however the\n\nsubstance of their conversation.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">14 On the night of 10 April 1999, she\n\nreturned an earlier page and the person on the line told her that he was Ah Tan, a friend\n\nof her late husband's. He then asked her to keep a few packets of things for him which he\n\nsaid would be delivered to her in one or two days' time. She claimed to have asked him\n\nwhat the packets contained but he did not tell her.</font></p>\n\n<p><i>\u00a0</i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">D5, recorded on 29 April 1999</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">15 In this statement, which was admitted\n\nupon the application of the defence, the appellant stated that when she discovered that\n\nthe packets contained opium, she waited for Ah Tan to call her. If he did not do so before\n\nher sons woke up, she would call the police. She did not however think of calling Ah Tan\n\nalthough she had his telephone number stored on her pager.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">16 When shown a photograph of Henry Tan\n\nKok Hwa, she again denied knowing if this was the same Ah Tan who had asked her to store\n\nthe packets of opium for him. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">17 At the close of the prosecution's case,\n\nthe learned trial judge found that the facts as disclosed by the appellant's police\n\nstatements were sufficient to found a prima facie case and called upon the appellant to\n\nenter her defence.</font></p>\n\n<p><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The defence</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">18 The appellant elected to give evidence.\n\n</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">19 The appellant was a 51-year-old\n\ndivorcee. She could not recall when she divorced her husband, but said that the latter\n\nmoved back in with her subsequently although they never remarried. Her husband was an\n\nopium addict.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">20 The appellant lived with her two sons\n\nat the Dover Road flat. She ran a seafood stall at the Dover Road hawker centre with her\n\nelder son, Ying Khui Hock (DW2). She met Henry Tan, whom she knew as 'Ah Tan', through her\n\nlate ex-husband. She testified that Ah Tan visited the family very often both at home and\n\nat the stall and was very close to them. In this connection, Henry Tan, his wife and his\n\ndaughter were all invited to Ying Khui Hock's wedding in January 1997 and his daughter's\n\ncar was even lent to the latter for use during the celebration. Meanwhile, Henry Tan also\n\nhelped the appellant's family in various ways over the years. In particular, he lent the\n\nappellant's ex-husband $40,000 to pay off his gambling debts and further gave the family a\n\nloan of $25,000 to renovate their flat. In addition, he also provided the funds for Ying\n\nKee Yeow (DW3), the appellant's younger son's education in Australia. None of these debts\n\nwere ever repaid by the appellant or her family nor did Ah Tan ever demand repayment of\n\nthem. Henry Tan further played a pivotal role in getting the appellant and her husband to\n\nreconcile after their divorce. After the husband's death in February 1998, Henry Tan\n\ncontinued to persuade Ying Khui Hock to enter into a joint venture restaurant business\n\nwith him and also continued to visit the appellant to find out how she was getting on. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">21 The appellant gave evidence that when\n\nher ex-husband was alive, he often kept things for Ah Tan at their flat. She claimed that\n\nher ex-husband told her that the things were dried foodstuffs from Pasir Panjang and were\n\nkept at their flat as it was closer to Pasir Panjang than Ah Tan's own home. The appellant\n\ndescribed that the things came in boxes of varying sizes and were tightly sealed so she\n\ncould not see their contents. The boxes would be delivered either by Ah Tan himself or one\n\nof his workers and would be collected back either several hours or one or two days later.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">22 Ah Tan continued to keep things at the\n\nappellant's flat after the husband's death. In February 1999, Ah Tan telephoned the\n\nappellant and told her that he had a few packets of things to be kept at her flat and that\n\nhe would collect them from her two days later. Following this, a sealed-up box was sent to\n\nher by one of Ah Tan's workers. As indicated, Ah Tan himself came and collected the box\n\ntwo days later. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">23 About a week before her arrest on 11\n\nApril 1999, Ah Tan called the appellant again and told her that he had a few packets of\n\nthings to be kept in her flat. She asked him what the things were to which he replied that\n\nthey were just 'a few packets of things'.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">24 On the night of 10 April 1999, Ah Tan\n\npaged the appellant again. She was at a wedding dinner that night and did not return the\n\npage until later. The page turned out to have been from Ah Tan, whose voice the appellant\n\nsaid she could recognise when she returned the page a few hours later. Again, Ah Tan told\n\nher that he had a few packets of things to be put in her flat. It was agreed that Ah Tan's\n\nworker would deliver the things and would call the appellant when he arrived at her block\n\nof flats the next morning. Ah Tan further told her that he would collect the things from\n\nher two days later.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">25 On the morning of 11 April 1999, the\n\nappellant received a telephone call sometime between 6.15am and 6.20am. The caller,\n\nspeaking in Hokkien, told her that someone had left some things with him to be passed to\n\nher. She instructed him to bring the things up to the third storey lift landing, and\n\nthereafter went out of her flat to meet the caller. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">26 At the third storey lift landing, the\n\nappellant met a Chinese man who had with him a travelling bag and a plastic bag. She\n\nconfirmed that he was sent by Ah Tan to deliver the things and thereafter told him to\n\nleave the things on the floor. She then brought the things into her flat. She testified\n\nthat the things were heavy and that she did not take a good look at them before returning\n\nto her flat.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">27 At the flat, the appellant took the two\n\nbags into the master bedroom. The travel bag was unzipped. When she placed the bags on the\n\nfloor, she discovered an odour emanating from them, one which she recognised to be the\n\nsmell of opium. Shocked, she ran out of her flat to look for the man who had delivered the\n\nbags to her. Her intention, she claimed, was to find out if he had delivered the wrong\n\nthings to her. She knew that opium was an illegal substance. She failed to locate the man\n\nand after one or two minutes, returned to her room. The smell from the opium became\n\nunbearable. The appellant then went to the living room of her flat and obtained some\n\nnewspapers with which she used to wrap the opium slabs individually. Thereafter, she went\n\nto the kitchen to get several plastic bags in which she placed each slab separately. She\n\nclaimed that all this was done in order to reduce the odour which she said was unbearably\n\nstrong. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">28 Subsequently, the appellant tried to\n\nwake her elder son Ying Khui Hock but before she could wake him fully, the CNB officers\n\nstarted knocking at her door. Afraid that her grandson would be frightened by the noise,\n\nshe let the officers in. The appellant alleged that it did occur to her to call the police\n\nthe moment she discovered the opium, but that she did not do so as her son's in-laws were\n\nstaying at the flat at that time and she was worried about how involving the police might\n\nappear to them. She further claimed that it also did occur to her to call Ah Tan but that\n\nshe did not do so as she was nervous and frightened.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">29 When asked by her counsel why she did\n\nnot respond to W/Insp Jenny Tan's question at her flat as to why she had brought the opium\n\ninto her house, the appellant replied that she was frightened and did not know how to\n\nanswer the question. She testified to the effect that as the person making the delivery\n\nwas merely a worker, she could not be sure if the drugs belonged to Ah Tan. As such, she\n\ndid not dare say anything in answer to W/Insp Jenny Tan's final question.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">30 The appellant confirmed that the charge\n\nagainst her as well as its consequences were read and explained to her after she was\n\nbrought back to the CNB. Thereafter, the notice of warning was also read and explained to\n\nher, after which she was invited to give a statement which she did. She further admitted\n\nthat at the time when she made her cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal\n\nProcedure Code (Cap 68) (i.e., P122), she was almost certain that Ah Tan was in fact\n\ninvolved with the opium. Nevertheless, she did not mention his name when giving this\n\nstatement as she wanted him to admit his own involvement. She knew however at the time of\n\ngiving this statement, that Ah Tan had been arrested along with several others as she had\n\nseen them at the CNB when she herself was taken in for questioning.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">31 When referred to her subsequent\n\ninvestigation statements by her counsel, the appellant corrected various parts of them and\n\nadmitted that several of those parts were incorrect. In particular, the appellant admitted\n\nthat she had lied when she said in her statements that Ah Tan never called her at home or\n\nat her stall but could not explain why she had told such a lie. She further admitted that\n\nshe had not told the truth in her statements when she stated that she did not know Ah\n\nTan's name, or that she had never spoken to him before or that she did not know if the\n\nperson who had paged for her on 10 April 1999 was Ah Tan. As before however, the appellant\n\nwas unable to proffer any explanation for her misstatements.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">32 When asked why she had not mentioned\n\nthe fact that she had come out of her flat again to look for the Chinese man upon\n\ndiscovering the opium in her investigation statements, the appellant simply said that she\n\nhad forgotten to mention it. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">33 In response to a question posed by the\n\nlearned trial judge, the appellant testified that she had the intention of calling the\n\npolice the moment she discovered the opium. She further said that had she called the\n\npolice, she would have told them that someone had left things in her flat and that the\n\nthings were opium. She stressed also that she would have given Ah Tan's name, description\n\nand telephone number to the police. When asked why she did not then mention Ah Tan to\n\nW/Insp Jenny Tan during the questioning session in her flat, the appellant simply replied\n\nthat she could not recall the reason for not having done so. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">34 During cross-examination by the learned\n\nDPP the next day, the appellant retracted her earlier testimony and claimed that it never\n\noccurred to her to call the police at all. She further alleged that her prior allegation\n\nthat she had intended to call the police was untrue. The appellant maintained that\n\nalthough she knew, at least by 12 April 1999, that Ah Tan was definitely involved with the\n\nopium, she nevertheless did not mention his relationship with her family in any of her\n\npolice statements as she wanted him to admit his connection to the drugs himself.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">35 In re-examination, the appellant again\n\nchanged her testimony and reverted to her original stand that she did in fact intend to\n\ncall the police upon discovery of the opium. She further said that her evidence in\n\ncross-examination about not having intended to call the police was not the truth, and\n\nadmitted that she owed Ah Tan a 'great favour'. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">36 The appellant's two sons were also\n\ncalled to give evidence for the defence. The gist of their evidence however did not relate\n\nto the main issues of the case. As such, we will not trouble ourselves with it in this\n\njudgment.</font></p>\n\n<p><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The decision below</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">37 At the end of the hearing, the learned\n\ntrial judge found that the appellant was indeed in possession of the opium at the time of\n\nher arrest. She knew that the substances were opium as she herself had admitted that she\n\nrecognised its odour. As the quantity of opium in this case exceeded the statutory minimum\n\nof 100g, the presumption under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) ('the MDA') came\n\ninto operation. The appellant was thus presumed to have been in possession of the opium\n\nfor the purpose of the trafficking and unless she could rebut that presumption, would be\n\nfound guilty of trafficking in opium.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">38 Upon analysing the evidence presented\n\nbefore him, the learned trial judge found that the appellant had not rebutted the\n\npresumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities and sentenced her to suffer the\n\nmandatory death penalty.</font></p>\n\n<p><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The law</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">39 The law relating to the offence of\n\ndrug-trafficking and the operation of the various statutory presumptions contained in the\n\nMDA are clear and well settled. There are, under the MDA, essentially two types of\n\ndrug-trafficking: The first is trafficking by one of the acts as defined in s 2 of the\n\nstatute, while the second is possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The\n\nlatter type, which is that with which we are concerned in this appeal, is created by s\n\n5(2) of the MDA. While the prosecution may rely on the presumptions in ss 18 and 21 when\n\nproving offences of the first type, its burden is heavier where offences of the second\n\ntype are concerned for actual possession of the drugs must then be proved. As such, in\n\nmaking out the charge against the appellant in the present case, the prosecution has the\n\ntask of adducing evidence to show that the appellant was in possession of the opium at the\n\nrelevant time: see <i>Low Kok Wai v PP</i> <nobr>[1994] 1 SLR 676</nobr>; <i>PP v Wan Yue Kong and ors</i>\n\n<nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 417</nobr> and <i>Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 253</nobr>. This it may do by\n\nproving firstly, that the appellant had physical control of the quantity of opium in\n\nquestion at the material time and secondly, that she knew that what she had under her\n\nphysical control was opium: see <i>Fun Seong Cheng v PP</i> <nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 523</nobr>; <i>Su Chee\n\nKiong v PP</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 782</nobr> and <i>Gulam bin Notam Mohd Shariff Jamalddin and anor v\n\nPP</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 181</nobr>. Once the above is satisfied, s 17 of the MDA then comes into\n\noperation, creating a presumption that the accused was in possession of the offensive\n\nsubstances for the purpose of trafficking in them. The relevant provisions of s 17 read as\n\nfollows: </font></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">17. Any person who is proved to have had\n\n  in his possession more than \u2013</font></p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">(a) 100 grammes of opium;</font></p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">\u2026..</font></p>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">whether or not contained in any substance,\n\n  extract, preparation or mixture shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for\n\n  the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not\n\n  for that purpose.</font></p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Hence, the mere fact that an accused is\n\nfound to be in possession of 100g or more of opium would automatically trigger the\n\npresumption of trafficking. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">40 This presumption however is not\n\nirrebuttable. In <i>Van Damme Johannes v PP</i> <nobr>[1994] 1 SLR 246</nobr>, it was explained by this\n\ncourt that once the presumption is brought into play, the onus then falls on the accused\n\nto discharge the presumption. It would then be up to the court to decide whether or not to\n\nbelieve him; to assess his credibility and veracity; to observe his demeanour; to listen\n\nto what he has to say; to go through the evidence and determine whether his story was\n\nconsistent and finally to make a judicial decision.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">41 Hence, once the presumption is\n\ntriggered, the burden falls on the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that he\n\nwas not in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.</font></p>\n\n<p><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Our decision</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The question of possession</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">42 The first issue which needed to be\n\ndetermined in this appeal therefore was the question of whether or not the prosecution had\n\neven succeeded in proving that the appellant was in possession of the opium at the time of\n\nher arrest, for, as mentioned earlier, possession of the drugs must be proved beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt before the presumption in s 17 of the MDA may be relied upon.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">43 In <i>Fun Seong Cheng v PP</i> (<i>supra</i>),\n\nthis court stated at p 537 that:</font></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Physical control is not enough for the\n\n  purpose of proving possession. There needs to be <i>mens rea</i> on the part of the\n\n  accused. <i>In Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</i> [1969] 2 AC 256, a case where\n\n  the House of Lords was trying to determine the meaning of 'possession' for the purpose of\n\n  s 1 of the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964, Lord Pearce had this to say:</font></p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">One may, therefore, exclude from the\n\n    'possession' intended by the Act the physical control of articles which have been\n\n    'planted' on him without his knowledge. But how much further is one to go? If one goes to\n\n    the extreme length of requiring the prosecution to prove that 'possession' implies a full\n\n    knowledge of the name and nature of the drugs concerned, the efficacy of the Act is\n\n    seriously impaired, since many drug pedlars may in truth be unaware of this. I think that\n\n    the term 'possession' is satisfied by a knowledge only of the existence of the thing\n\n    itself and not its qualities\u2026</font></p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">In <i>Tan Ah Tee v PP</i> <nobr>[1980] 1 MLJ 49</nobr>; <nobr>[1978-1979] SLR 211</nobr>, a case concerning the meaning of 'possession' in the Misuse of Drugs\n\n  Act 1973, Lord Pearce's dicta was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal. Wee Chong\n\n  Jin CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:</font></p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n\n    <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">In our opinion, the word 'possession' in\n\n    the Act should be construed as that word has been construed by Lord Pearce and we would\n\n    respectfully adopt his reasons as contained in his speech. </font></p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">A long line of cases have since followed <i>Tan\n\n  Ah Tee v PP</i> and <i>Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</i>.</font></p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">In the recent case of<i> Gulam bin Notan\n\nMohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP</i> (<i>supra</i>), we confirmed that the above passages from <i>Fun\n\nSeong Cheng's</i> case are still good law and applied them accordingly. What needs to be\n\nproved in each case therefore is that the accused had knowledge of the existence of the\n\n'thing' in question.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">44 Applying the law to the facts of the\n\ninstant case, we found that the prosecution had more than amply proven that the appellant\n\nwas indeed in possession of the opium when the CNB officers raided her flat on the morning\n\nof 11 April 1999. Clearly the opium was within her physical possession, for they were\n\nfound in her master bedroom and she had in any case admitted having brought them into her\n\nflat from outside. She further never denied that she knew that the substances contained in\n\nthe two bags were opium. With this knowledge, she proceeded to wrap each slab of opium\n\nneatly with newspapers in her bedroom and thereafter placed each neatly-wrapped slab into\n\nseparate plastic bags and tied them up. She then even bothered to put the things under her\n\nbed and pulled the bedcover over so that they would be hidden from view. Not once did the\n\nappellant ever attempt to reject possession of the substances after she had discovered\n\ntheir true nature. Clearly we found that on the evidence, the prosecution had more than\n\nadequately satisfied its burden of proving that the appellant knew that what she had in\n\nher physical possession was opium and in our view, that is all that is required to trigger\n\nthe presumption of trafficking in s 17. </font></p>\n\n<p><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The presumption of trafficking \u2013\n\nwhether rebutted?</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">45 Having found the fact of possession to\n\nhave been proved by the prosecution, the onus then shifted to the appellant to show that\n\nshe was not in possession of the opium for the purpose of trafficking. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">46 The appellant did not deny that she\n\nknew of the existence and nature of the drugs soon after she had returned to her flat.\n\nNeither did she advance the assertion that the drugs were for her own consumption. Her\n\nonly defence appeared to be that she did not know that the bags contained opium at the\n\ntime when they were passed to her by Lim at the third storey lift landing of her block of\n\nflats, and this, her counsel argued was sufficient to rebut the presumption of\n\ntrafficking.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">47 In our view, the above argument by\n\ncounsel was wholly misconceived. While the appellant's lack of knowledge of the contents\n\nof the bags when she received them might have the effect of disproving possession of the\n\nopium on her part, it clearly did nothing towards rebutting the presumption of\n\ntrafficking. Quite the contrary, we had no doubt that the appellant's subsequent behaviour\n\nin the flat upon discovering the opium clearly supported the presumption of trafficking\n\nrather than had the effect of rebutting it. The appellant testified that she knew that the\n\nitems contained in the bags were opium when she returned to her master bedroom. She\n\nfurther conceded that she knew that opium was an illegal substance. In these\n\ncircumstances, one would have expected that her immediate reaction would have been to call\n\nthe police, to wake her sons, or to call Ah Tan to find out why he had passed the opium to\n\nher. Yet not one of these courses of action did the appellant adopt. She instead took the\n\ntrouble to individually wrap and pack each slab of opium with newspapers, and even placed\n\nthem into separate plastic bags. Her allegation that she was frightened and anxious and\n\ndid not know what to do clearly did not hold water when one considers the neatness and\n\nmeticulousness with which she had packed each slab of opium. If she had indeed been scared\n\nor worried as she claimed, then in all likelihood the slabs, if wrapped at all, would have\n\nbeen wrapped altogether and haphazardly, rather than individually. The neatly-wrapped\n\nslabs of opium as found by the CNB officers clearly demonstrated the work of a person with\n\na calm and composed frame of mind who knew exactly what she was doing rather than one\n\nfraught with angst and anxiety.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">48 With respect to the allegation that she\n\nhad wrapped the slabs of opium in order to reduce the odour of the opium, we found that\n\nthis too was a ludicrous suggestion and as such, rightly disbelieved by the learned trial\n\njudge. The appellant had herself admitted that her late ex-husband was an opium addict,\n\nand that was how she came to recognise the odour of the drug. This being the case, it\n\nseemed to us that the appellant must have been quite used to the smell of opium and could\n\nnot possibly have been overly offended by it. As such, it is difficult to see why there\n\nshould be such a pressing need or want for her to reduce the odour of the drugs and her\n\nevidence to the effect that she could not stand the smell of the opium should thus be\n\ntreated with circumspect. If the appellant's reason for wanting to reduce the odour was\n\nbecause her son's in-laws were visiting and staying in the flat at that time and she did\n\nnot want them to notice the smell, which she in any event denied to be the case, this too\n\nwas a flimsy reason which we found to be unbelievable. There was no reason why the\n\nappellant should have been worried about her guests noticing the smell if she herself was\n\ninnocent of the drugs or if the drugs had been wrongly handed to her as she claimed. In\n\nany case, we were of the view that if the smell was indeed bothering the appellant to such\n\na grave extent, the simplest thing for her to do would have been to throw the bags of\n\nopium away for she had no reason to keep them if her claim that she did not have anything\n\nto do with the drugs was true.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">49 With respect to the appellant's\n\nevidence to the effect that she did not implicate Henry Tan in her statements because it\n\nwas his worker who had delivered the bags to her and as such she could not be sure if the\n\nopium came from Henry Tan, we found this explanation to be similarly devoid of merit. The\n\nappellant herself testified in court that before accepting the bags, she first confirmed\n\nwith Lim if he had been sent by Ah Tan to deliver the things. In the premises, she must\n\nhave known that the things were from Henry Tan. Next, if she was still unsure as to\n\nwhether the opium in fact belonged to Henry Tan, she could have called him to check the\n\nmoment she discovered the drugs. Yet she did not do so despite the time lag of 15 minutes\n\nbetween her discovery and the subsequent raid on her flat. In addition, there was also\n\nconsiderable delay on the appellant's part in opening the door for the CNB officers\n\ndespite the fact that she was already wide awake at that time, as evidenced by the fact\n\nthat one of the officers had even begun to cut the iron grille and padlock before the\n\nappellant came to the door. In these circumstances, the inescapable conclusion once again\n\nappeared to be that the appellant knew beforehand that she was to receive the drugs from\n\nLim that morning and that she knew fully well that she was engaging in some illicit\n\nactivity.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">50 There was no doubt that the appellant\n\nwas given ample opportunity to relate Henry Tan's involvement with the opium but yet not\n\nonce did she explain his involvement or his relationship to her and her family until the\n\ntrial. It is telling that when W/Insp Jenny Tan questioned her in the flat, the appellant\n\nremained silent when asked why she had brought the opium into her house. She claimed to\n\nhave been confused and frightened and that it did not occur to her to exculpate herself in\n\nany way nor did she wish to implicate anyone. Subsequently however, when her investigation\n\nstatements were taken, the appellant again failed to tell the whole truth about Henry\n\nTan's involvement with the drugs as well as his earlier dealings with her family,\n\npreferring instead to fudge his identity. Bearing in mind the fact that the opium had been\n\nfound in the appellant's bedroom and that she had admitted having brought them into her\n\nflat from outside, one would have expected the appellant to have attempted to explain and\n\nexonerate herself in the face of the extremely compelling evidence against her. The many\n\ninstances of her failure to do so, when taken collectively, clearly fortified the\n\ninference that the appellant was in some way involved with the opium.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">51 Another factor strongly suggestive of\n\nthe appellant's guilt was the suspicious manner of the delivery of the bags of opium to\n\nher. It will be recalled that the appellant had asked Lim to meet her at the staircase\n\nlanding of the third storey rather than at her flat itself. When queried about this, the\n\nappellant gave the feeble excuse that this was done as Lim did not know her unit number.\n\nWe found this explanation to be unconvincing. There was no reason why the appellant could\n\nnot have given her unit number to Lim or for her to have waited at the entrance of her\n\nflat for him. After all, it appeared that previous deliveries of things to her or to her\n\nlate ex-husband by Ah Tan or his workers had always been done directly to her flat. There\n\nwas no suggestion that the appellant or her husband ever had to come out of the flat to\n\ncollect the things from the workers. Consequently, there was no reason why an exception\n\nhad to be made in the present case, unless the appellant was concerned not to alert the\n\nother occupants of her flat as to what was truly going on. The appellant also stated in\n\nher investigation statements that while at the staircase landing, she saw 'so much things'\n\nin both bags and became frightened. Indeed, it is difficult to see why there was any\n\nreason for her to be afraid if this was but another of Ah Tan's regular deliveries to her,\n\nall of which had hitherto not led her to any trouble. In the premises, it appeared that\n\nthe appellant's fear could only have been derived from her own guilty knowledge that she\n\nwas dealing with drugs. It is further pertinent that the appellant must have felt the\n\nweight of the bags when she started dragging them back to her flat from the corridor.\n\nDespite noticing that the bags were unusually heavy, the appellant's first reaction was\n\nnot to try and look for Lim immediately or to examine the contents then and there.\n\nInstead, she was content to drag the bags all the way from the staircase landing right\n\ninto the master bedroom of the flat first, close and lock the main door, before opening to\n\nsee what the bags contained. Again, such behaviour on her part strongly suggested that she\n\nalready knew what was in the bags when she received them. With regard to the reference in\n\nher cautioned statement to the fact that she had run out of her flat again to look for Lim\n\nupon discovery of the opium, we were of the view that little weight should be given to\n\nthis for the following reasons. Firstly, the only time that this was mentioned was as\n\nsaid, in the appellant's cautioned statement. Thereafter, the appellant failed to mention\n\nthis fact in the rest of her investigation statements to the police. Next, SSgt Yeoh Seng\n\nHock (PW16) who had been observing the appellant that morning from the exit driveway of\n\nthe carpark to Block 31 Dover Road did not notice the appellant re-emerging from her flat\n\nand walking to the stairwell to look for Lim as she claimed to have done. Finally, the\n\nappellant's subsequent behaviour in wrapping each slab of opium neatly and impeccably is\n\nsimply inconsistent with that of a person who did not wish to be in possession of the\n\ndrugs and who was anxious to return them to the person who had given them to her. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">52 It is further pertinent at this stage\n\nto point out that even if the appellant was unaware that opium would be delivered to her\n\nand that she intended upon their discovery to return the drugs back to Henry Tan when the\n\nopportunity arose, this alone is sufficient to constitute the offence of trafficking under\n\ns 5(1)(a) of the MDA. It was clarified in <i>Lee Yuan Kwang &amp; Ors v PP</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 SLR 349</nobr> that under s 5(2) of the MDA, a person commits the offence of trafficking if he\n\nhad in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. The appellant in this\n\ncase, like the fourth appellant in <i>Lee Yuan Kwang</i>, claimed that she had vacillated\n\nupon discovering the drugs about whether to call the police or to return the drugs to\n\ntheir true owner. It will be recalled that her evidence as to whether or not she had\n\nintended to call the police upon discovering the opium was extremely flimsy and that she\n\nhad thrice changed her testimony on this account without offering any reasonable\n\nexplanation for doing so, thus leading the learned trial judge to find that the evidence\n\nsupporting her innocence was not credible. It is clear after <i>Lee Yuan Kwang</i>'s case\n\nthat a mere bailee or custodian of drugs may be said to have had possession of the drugs\n\nfor the purpose of trafficking if by a future act, possession of the drugs would have been\n\ntransferred back to their true owner: see also <i>Loh Kim Cheng v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 2 SLR 315</nobr>.\n\nAs such, even if the appellant had been waiting for Henry Tan to call her and had intended\n\nto return the drugs back to him or to his worker, this alone would constitute the offence\n\nof trafficking. </font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">53 Counsel for the appellant further\n\nadvanced the point that Henry Tan was a close family friend who had often kept things at\n\nher flat without trouble, and as such, there was no reason for her to suspect that he\n\nwould be involved in illegal activities or that he should be passing her drugs to keep for\n\nhim. In our view, this part of the appellant's claim should not be given any weight for\n\naside from the appellant's own testimony, which was found by the learned trial judge to be\n\ngenerally unworthy of credit, there was no other evidence before the court to support the\n\nappellant's assertion. It was in fact pertinent to us that while both Henry Tan and Lim\n\nBeng Soon, the deliveryman, were available as witnesses and were in fact offered as\n\nwitnesses to the defence, the appellant nevertheless chose not to call either of them to\n\ntestify for her. The burden of rebutting the statutory presumption of trafficking having\n\nbeen cast by the legislature upon the appellant, we had no doubt that an adverse inference\n\nunder s 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) ought to be drawn against her for her failure\n\nto call both Henry Tan and Lim as witnesses. It may thus be assumed that any evidence\n\ngiven by the two men had they been called would have been unfavourable to the appellant.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">54 Finally, the defence contended that the\n\nlearned trial judge erred in placing too much weight on the appellant's inconsistencies,\n\ncontradictions and unanswered questions at the trial. In our opinion, even if the learned\n\ntrial judge had in fact placed undue weight on several of the relatively more minor\n\ninconsistencies made by the appellant, the objective evidence as a whole still supported\n\nthe finding that the presumption of trafficking had not been rebutted by the appellant.\n\nThe defence placed great emphasis on the fact that the appellant had only five years of\n\nprimary education and was a simple-minded woman who was easily confused. She was moreover\n\nunder tremendous stress during the trial and broke down several times. While the appellant\n\nmight not have known that being in possession of more than a certain specified quantity of\n\nopium was a capital offence, or that she did not think she was doing anything wrong by\n\nmerely storing the drugs for a few days, this was irrelevant for our purposes as ignorance\n\nof the law or its consequences for that mater, is never a defence to a criminal charge. In\n\nrespect of the appellant's evidence given at the trial, we noted that the learned trial\n\njudge had been extremely indulgent and patient with her and had given her ample\n\nopportunities to explain herself more clearly and to correct her mistakes, whenever any\n\nhad been made. The appellant herself had often asked for time to answer a lot of the\n\nquestions, including those posed by her own counsel, and each time, her request was always\n\ngranted without question. In spite of this however, all that the appellant could come up\n\nwith was usually that she either could not remember, that she did not know how to answer\n\nthe question or that she simply did not know why she had said or done a particular thing.\n\nIn these circumstances, the learned trial judge could hardly be faulted for having made a\n\nnegative assessment of the appellant's veracity and we saw no reason to disturb his\n\nfinding.</font></p>\n\n<p><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Conclusion</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">55 In light of the above reasons, we found\n\nthat the learned trial judge was correct in concluding that the appellant was guilty of\n\nthe offence as charged and that she had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the\n\nMDA.

The parties then commenced the process of settling the ancillary matters. As by then the children of the marriage were adults, the process focussed on the issues of maintenance and division of matrimonial property. Each party filed substantial affidavits in support of their respective claims; the marriage having lasted some 35 years and the parties having been successful in business, there were many documents and factual allegations to be explored.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"2\" pID=\"p1_2\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">After some two years of this process, the parties decided to go for mediation. The mediation took place on 11 May 2011. It resulted in a document, signed by both husband and wife, which has in this appeal been referred to as the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d. The Settlement Agreement was intended to settle all disputes and be translated into an order of court. This did not happen, unfortunately; towards the end of 2011, the wife\u2019s lawyers informed the husband\u2019s lawyers that the wife did not wish to be bound by the Settlement Agreement.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In January 2012, the husband filed a summons before the Family Court for the terms of the Settlement Agreement to be recorded as an order of court. No order was made on this application as the District Judge took the view that it was for the judge hearing the ancillary matters to decide whether the Settlement Agreement was binding. The ancillary matters then came on before the High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d). The Judge decided not to give effect to the Settlement Agreement and, instead, carried out a division exercise pursuant to which the assets were divided differently than provided for in the Settlement Agreement. The Judge\u2019s grounds can be found at <Emphasis type=\"i\">Sita Jaswant Kaur v Surindar Singh s/o Jaswant Singh</Emphasis> [2013] SGHC 176 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband has appealed against the Judgment and the main issue before this court is what weight should be given to the Settlement Agreement.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Further background information </Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This was a long marriage: the husband (the appellant herein) and the wife (the respondent herein) were married in 1972 and lived together until 2001.

Mr Amolat Singh, a senior lawyer, was appointed as the mediator.

The Judge found that the division proposed in the Settlement Agreement was not just and equitable because the husband would receive 68% of the assets while the wife would only receive 32% of them, and this proportion did not include the other assets disclosed by the husband and wife, which were not provided for in the Settlement Agreement.

If there is a binding agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce, that will be a relevant factor in the court\u2019s determination of what is a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets under the Charter. In determining whether a binding agreement between husband and wife to settle their disputes over property and maintenance exists, the court must be guided by the legal requirements of the common law of contract because such agreements are contracts to begin with (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR and another appeal</Emphasis> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis>\u201d) at [94]).

We cannot accept this argument. If the parties had concluded a binding agreement and the husband had indeed attempted to re-negotiate its terms thereafter, that in itself would not have discharged or terminated such agreement. Instead, the agreement would have remained binding and its terms would have remained in force.

In the same letter, the husband stated that if the <Emphasis type=\"i\">en bloc</Emphasis> exercise failed, he would settle his half share of the overdraft at that time. In fact, the wife\u2019s solicitors accepted this as the draft consent order, sent to the husband on 6 October 2011, was amended to reflect the husband\u2019s position.

On this basis, the husband argued that the Settlement Agreement was not merely a factor to be taken into account in the court\u2019s exercise of its power to order a division of matrimonial assets under s 112, but, as a binding contract, had to be given full effect by the court.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"42\" pID=\"p1_42\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We do not agree that agreements reached <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> divorce proceedings have commenced are not caught by s 112(2)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">e</Emphasis>) of the  Charter.

The words \u201cmade in contemplation of divorce\u201d simply clarify that the parties must have intended for the agreement to govern the allocation of matrimonial assets upon the contingency of divorce, whenever that might actually happen, in contradistinction to a time when the parties are still married (see also <Emphasis type=\"i\">Lian Hwee Choo Phebe v Tan Seng Ong</Emphasis> [2013] 3 SLR 1162 at [20]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"43\" pID=\"p1_43\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband\u2019s argument is also inconsistent with the express words of s 112 and the general approach of the court in ordering the division of matrimonial assets. These are that: (a) the ultimate power resides in the court to order the division of matrimonial assets \u201cin such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable\u201d; and (b) a postnuptial agreement cannot be enforced directly but only by the court after considering all the circumstances, and any such agreement cannot \u201coust the jurisdiction of court\u201d to determine division of assets: <Emphasis type=\"i\">AOO v AON</Emphasis> [2011] 4 SLR 1169 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">AOO v AON</Emphasis>\u201d) at [19] (this is consistent with the position relating to prenuptial agreements, as stated in <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis> at [73], [77], [80] and [104]). In any event, even if agreements reached <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> divorce proceedings have commenced are not strictly caught by s\u00a0112(2)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">e</Emphasis>), this does not preclude the court from considering the agreement because the court is required to have regard to \u201call the circumstances of the case\u201d, and the factors set out in s 112(2), which are factors to be considered by the court in reaching a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets, are not exhaustive: see <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis> at [78].</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"44\" pID=\"p1_44\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband referred to <Emphasis type=\"i\">Lock Han Chng Jonathan (Jonathan Luo Hancheng) v Goh Jessiline</Emphasis> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 455 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Jonathan Lock</Emphasis>\u201d) at [38] for the proposition that \u201cin order to give efficacy to [Court Dispute Resolution], a court-mediated settlement must be binding on the parties and carried out according to its terms\u201d. This argument is misconceived because <Emphasis type=\"i\">Jonathan Lock</Emphasis> was concerned with the quantification and assessment of damages arising from a road traffic accident and not the division of matrimonial assets in divorce proceedings. The latter is governed by s 112 of the Charter, which gives the court the overriding discretion to decide on the just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

There is judicial recognition that postnuptial agreements relating to the division of matrimonial assets may be given more weight than prenuptial agreements because the circumstances are very different from those in relation to prenuptial agreements (even though the weight to be allocated to an agreement must ultimately depend on the precise circumstances): <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis> at [75]. In reaching a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets between the parties, the court can choose to place more weight on such agreements where the circumstances show that the process by which the parties reached the agreement is fair, and the agreement does not seem to be manifestly disadvantageous to one party.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"46\" pID=\"p1_46\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband argued that settlement agreements on ancillary matters made after private mediation would necessarily be converted into a consent order. However, that is not the case as the parties can still choose not to agree to a consent order being entered into. Court scrutiny of the agreement is necessary and there are two requirements that must be satisfied: (a) that there is a real contract between the parties; and (b) actual consent of the parties must be signified to the court (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">AOO v AON</Emphasis> at [13] and [15]). Hence, where there is a deed of settlement that has been signed but a party did not participate in the proceedings at all, that would not satisfy the second requirement stated above and the ancillary order is liable to be set aside: see <Emphasis type=\"i\">AOO v AON</Emphasis> at [18].</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"47\" pID=\"p1_47\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The provisions of s 112(2)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">e</Emphasis>) mean that the court has the discretion not to give full effect to an agreement entered into by divorced parties with regard to the distribution of their assets.

The Judge considered that the proposed division in the Settlement Agreement was not just and equitable because the husband would receive 68% of the assets while the wife would only receive 32% of the assets, and this proportion did not include the other assets disclosed by the husband and wife which were not provided for in the Settlement Agreement. Accordingly, the Judge declined to give the Settlement Agreement conclusive weight and carried out his own division exercise.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"49\" pID=\"p1_49\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Although the Judge is correct that under s 112(2) of the Charter, the presence of an agreement between the parties in regard to distribution of assets is only listed as one of the factors to be considered, with respect, this does not mean that, in all circumstances, such an agreement would have no greater weight than any other of the listed factors. The factors are a guide to the court, not a mandatory list of items that must be ticked off and given equal weight if they exist. To follow such a course would lead to a mechanistic process of division which would not always be fair. The discretion given to the court to achieve a just and fair distribution means that if the facts warrant it one or more factors may be given more weight than the others and even primacy over the others. In the circumstances of this case, our view is that the Settlement Agreement should have been given significant, if not conclusive, weight.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">The approach towards postnuptial agreements relating to the division of matrimonial assets</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"50\" pID=\"p1_50\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Generally speaking, agreements dealing with the distribution of assets upon divorce can be placed in two categories: prenuptial and postnuptial. In <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis>, this court held that there is no blanket rule that a prenuptial agreement must be enforced to the exclusion of all the other relevant circumstances before the court; much will depend on the precise terms of that agreement as viewed in the context of all relevant circumstances as a whole, including the matters set out in s 112(2) of the Charter (at [80]). We recognised that it might well be the case that a prenuptial agreement is, given the circumstances as a whole, considered to be so crucial that it is, in effect, enforced in its entirety.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"51\" pID=\"p1_51\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The issue that arises here is how much weight should be accorded to postnuptial agreements in general. Postnuptial agreements are made in circumstances that are very different from those existing in relation to prenuptial agreements. Such differences may warrant the courts according postnuptial agreements more weight than prenuptial agreements in the exercise of their discretion under s 112(2)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">e</Emphasis>) of the Charter.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"52\" pID=\"p1_52\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It is useful to draw a distinction between two kinds of postnuptial agreements. Postnuptial agreements may be made when the husband and wife are still together and intend to remain together, or when they are at the point of separating or have already separated, in which case, the postnuptial agreement may be called a \u201cseparation agreement\u201d. A separation agreement is made when the marriage has failed and when the parties have either gone their separate ways or are proposing to do so. The separation agreement is meant to cater to the immediate needs and desires of the parties, instead of some future possibility of breakup which the couple neither want nor expect to happen. Therefore, as a general proposition, where the parties enter into a separation agreement, especially after divorce or separation proceedings have already commenced, such a separation agreement will, in our view, generally carry significant weight. Nevertheless, the weight to be allocated to a postnuptial agreement in each case must ultimately depend on the precise circumstances of the case.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"53\" pID=\"p1_53\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In determining the weight to be given to separation agreements, we endorse these observations by Ormrod LJ made in the context of a separation agreement in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Edgar v Edgar</Emphasis> [1980] 1 WLR 1410 at 1417:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">To decide what weight should be given, in order to reach a just result, to a prior agreement not to claim a lump sum, regard must be had to the conduct of both parties, leading up to the prior agreement, and to their subsequent conduct, in consequence of it. It is not necessary in this connection to think in formal legal terms, such as misrepresentation or estoppel; <Emphasis type=\"i\">all</Emphasis> the circumstances as they affect each of two human beings must be considered in the complex relationship of marriage. So, the circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement are relevant. Under pressure by one side, exploitation of a dominant position to secure an unreasonable advantage, inadequate knowledge, possibly bad legal advice, an important change of circumstances, unforeseen or overlooked at the time of making the agreement, are all relevant to the question of justice between the parties. Important too is the general proposition that formal agreements, properly and fairly arrived at with competent legal advice, should not be displaced unless there are good and substantial grounds for concluding that an injustice will be done by holding the parties to the terms of their agreement. There may well be other considerations which affect the justice of this case; the above list is not intended to be an exclusive catalogue.

This approach is sensible because the parties to a marriage are in the best position to determine what is a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets based on their own assessment of each party\u2019s direct and indirect contributions to the marriage and their knowledge of the extent and value of the assets. Due to the inherent limitations of fact-finding in the litigation process, the court should not lightly depart from such a separation agreement.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"55\" pID=\"p1_55\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In this connection, there is judicial recognition that divorce is a very personal matter and there may be private reasons as to why certain concessions were made in reaching a settlement agreement. This was recognised in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</Emphasis> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 548 at [5], in the context of whether a consent order should be rescinded:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Under s 112(4) of the Women's Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed), the court \u201cmay, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made\u201d. But this section, and the authorities referred to by Mr Chia, should not be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact, more equitable in the objective opinion of the court. Privately settled terms in respect of the ancillary matters in a divorce may not always appear to be fair. But divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement. What the court should be alert to, is that one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. Hence, in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Dean v Dean</Emphasis> [1978] 3 All ER 758, the court held (as set out in the headnote) that:</Text>\n          <Quote level=\"2\">\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">[W]here an agreement between the parties had been reached at arm's length and the parties had been separately advised, the agreement itself would be prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of its terms, and formal discovery would probably be unnecessary.</Text>\n          </Quote>\n        </Quote>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"56\" pID=\"p1_56\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We are of the view that giving significant weight to a separation agreement, unless there are good and substantial grounds for concluding that an injustice will be done, is not inconsistent either with the approach in <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis> or with s 112 of the Charter. This does not mean that in every case significant weight will be given to such an agreement. Whilst the court may incline to give significant weight to a separation agreement which the parties have freely and voluntarily arrived at with the benefit of legal advice, the court will always (consistently with s 112(2)) examine the precise circumstances before it to determine whether in the instant case it would be unfair to do so. In determining whether such unfairness exists, the court will not accord great significance to the fact that it might have made a different distribution than that agreed to.

Andrew Ang J found that it would be inequitable to the wife to hold both parties to the clause in question as the husband, in breach of the recitals, had failed to disclose his acquisition of shares worth some S$12m and S$985,000 as consideration thereof when the deed was being drawn up, and had subsequently failed to comply with his duty of full and frank disclosure to the court. These shares and the consideration were found to be matrimonial assets which the wife would have had a share of had they been disclosed under the agreement.

This cannot happen as long as they are disputing the division of the assets and having to rebut each other\u2019s cases in relation to the same. That process often breeds contention and bitterness. Thus, it would be in both parties\u2019 interests if they could come to a negotiated solution without resorting to determination by the courts which would resuscitate old complaints and acrimonious feelings. The process also takes time and can be costly. Such solutions can be facilitated by mediation. Accordingly, if the mediation process is properly followed, as it was in this case, the parties having participated in the process and received advice thereon, and a settlement agreement results, the

No suggestion of such vitiating factors has been made.

In situations such as this where the finances of the parties are intertwined, as they often are in a marriage, the parties are in a better position to decide on what is a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets, based on facts which in truth only they are really privy to. We note further that there were other assets in each party\u2019s sole ownership which were to be kept by him/her and were not affected by the Settlement Agreement. For example, the wife has some gold and jewellery which are of value.

That may not be as advantageous to the wife because while the surplus sale proceeds from the <Emphasis type=\"i\">en bloc</Emphasis> sale of the wife\u2019s City Towers Property would be shared between the husband and wife in accordance with the Settlement Agreement, there would not be an <Emphasis type=\"i\">en bloc</Emphasis> sale of the husband\u2019s Jalan Mat Jambol Property and hence there would be no surplus sale proceeds to be divided in accordance with the Settlement Agreement.</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"68\" pID=\"p1_68\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We accept that the Settlement Agreement was based on the common anticipation that there would likely be <Emphasis type=\"i\">en bloc</Emphasis> sales of both the City Towers Property and the Jalan Mat Jambol Property. Apparently, neither property was subsequently sold as part of an <Emphasis type=\"i\">en bloc</Emphasis> sale. That, however, does not detract from the fact that the Settlement Agreement was made on the basis of the agreed valuations as at March 2009, and that the parties agreed to share the surplus of the sale proceeds, if any, in the specified proportions. Accordingly, the orders we make below do, in substance, give effect to the parties\u2019 common intention evidenced in the Settlement Agreement to share the sale proceeds of the two properties to the extent the same exceeded the values given as at March 2009.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"69\" pID=\"p1_69\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the foregoing reasons, we allow the appeal and order that:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_69-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The wife is to sell the City Towers Property in the open market within six months.

level=\"1\" no=\"1\" pID=\"p1_1\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This is the husband\u2019s appeal against certain orders made in respect of ancillary matters arising out of a divorce. The marriage broke down after 19 months and the parties entered into a deed of separation (\u201cthe Deed\u201d) thereafter. The Deed made detailed provisions for the parties\u2019 uncoupling, including matters relating to the care of their daughter, the only child of the marriage (\u201cthe child\u201d). Following the grant of an interim judgment of divorce, the wife sought to set aside the Deed on the ground of undue influence while the husband, though seeking to uphold the validity of the Deed, sought to vary the incidence of care and control of the child, which resided with the wife in accordance with the terms of the Deed. The High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) held that the Deed had been entered into freely and voluntarily and that there was no basis to set it aside. While not altering the care and control arrangement, the Judge varied the terms of the Deed on the division of matrimonial assets and the amount to be paid in maintenance for the child. The husband appeals against the Judge\u2019s decision to vary the Deed on the issues of division and maintenance but not in relation to care and control.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"2\" pID=\"p1_2\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This appeal requires this court to examine what weight it should ascribe to the terms of a postnuptial agreement concluded by the parties in contemplation of a divorce when it is required to decide issues relating to (a) the division of matrimonial assets, (b) child maintenance, and (c) the award of care and control of the children of the marriage. Each issue engages different legal interests and considerations and, therefore, the role played by postnuptial agreements differs in each of them. In the course of our judgment, we will reaffirm several previous pronouncements of this court on these issues and elaborate on their requirements.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Background</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"3\" pID=\"p1_3\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This case involves a whirlwind courtship and a short-lived marriage. In January 2007, the wife, a lady of Ukrainian descent who was living and working in Germany, made the acquaintance of the husband, a German who was living and working in Singapore, on the internet. Matters moved quickly, as things in cyberspace often do. In March 2007, the husband proposed. In April 2007, the parties wed. In July 2007, the wife moved to Singapore. She became pregnant shortly after and delivered the child on 7 March 2008.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Unfortunately, the marriage did not last. From 15 November 2008 (about 19 months after they married), the parties began living separately. They soon took steps to formalise their separation, eventually entering into the Deed on 21 April 2009. The wife commenced divorce proceedings on 18 August 2011 but this was withdrawn by consent on 17 January 2012 and she filed the present divorce proceedings on 3 February 2012 on the ground of three years\u2019 separation. This was uncontested and interim judgment was granted on 24 April 2012. Under the interim judgment, the husband was ordered to pay a sum of $2,950 to the wife each month (comprising $1,500 in maintenance for the child and $1,450 for the child\u2019s share of the rental expenses). It was stated that this order on rent was made without prejudice to either party\u2019s entitlement to challenge the payments during the substantive hearing. After the divorce, both parties continue to live and work in Singapore and the child presently resides with the wife, with whom care and control is reposed.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The Deed</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Given that the Deed lies at the crux of this dispute, we will summarise its relevant terms. The Deed was negotiated over a period of five months and the parties were represented by solicitors throughout. For a start, the Deed provided that the parties had and would continue to live separate and apart from 15 November 2008 \u201cas if each were single and unmarried and free from the marital control (if any) of the other\u201d (cl 1.1); that neither would \u201crequire the other to cohabit with him or her and vice versa\u201d (cl 1.2); and that either of them might commence divorce proceedings three years thereafter with the consent of the other party (cl 2.1). The Deed also made detailed provisions for all matters that a court would have to consider in ancillary proceedings arising out of a divorce: <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, the division of matrimonial assets, maintenance, and custody and care and control. We will discuss each in turn.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the issue of division, cl 5.1 stated that each of the parties was to retain the assets in their respective names. Clause 5.2 provided that the parties\u2019 matrimonial home (a condominium), which had been purchased by the husband before the marriage and which mortgage the husband had serviced throughout, was to remain his sole property. In return, the husband was to arrange for the wife and her child to stay in a separate apartment (cl 5.2). The Deed recorded that the husband had already paid the deposit of $5,400 for the rental of a separate apartment and that he was to pay the wife an additional sum of $2,700 per month as rent (over and above any sums he was liable to pay in maintenance) for the duration of the tenancy, which was to expire on 14 November 2011 (cll 3.2 and 3.4). It was stated that after this, \u201cthe Husband shall no longer be obliged to pay for the rent of any accommodation for the Wife and [their child] and shall only be responsible to pay maintenance as hereafter set out\u201d (cl 3.4). Additionally, the husband was to pay a \u201cDivorce Settlement\u201d in the sum of $40,000 to the wife \u201cfor her contribution towards the marriage (if any and which contribution is denied by the husband)\u201d (cl 3.1). The reason for the proviso, presumably, was to maintain the husband\u2019s claim to sole ownership of the matrimonial home. This sum of $40,000 was to comprise the sum of $10,000 which had already been paid to the wife on 19 August 2008 (cl 3.1); the deposit of $5,400 which the husband had paid for the rental of the separate apartment, which the wife was entitled to retain after moving out (cl 3.2); and a sum of $24,600, which was payable upon the grant of a final judgment of divorce (cl 3.3).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the issue of maintenance, the husband was to pay a sum of $2,300 as combined maintenance for the wife and their child until 15 November 2011 (cl 3.5).

This was accompanied by a short supplemental judgment (reported as <Emphasis type=\"i\">ATZ v AUA</Emphasis> [2015] SGHC 182 (\u201cthe Supplemental Judgment\u201d)), which made a minor correction to the order for maintenance for the child. All paragraph references in this section will, unless otherwise stated, be references to paragraphs in the Judgment and not the Supplemental Judgment. The Judge first held (and the parties do not now challenge) that the parties had entered into the Deed freely and voluntarily (at [37]) and that it was a valid agreement within the meaning of s\u00a0112(2)(<Emphasis type=\"i\">e</Emphasis>) of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Charter\u201d) (at [47]). She also held that the only significant matrimonial asset in contention was the matrimonial home, which had a net value of $1.6m, and so the sum of $40,000 awarded to the wife under the Deed represented 2.5% of the net value of the matrimonial home (at [56] and [57]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the issue of division, the Judge accepted that the terms of a postnuptial agreement which was negotiated with the benefit of legal advice (as the Deed was) would normally be ascribed \u201csignificant weight\u201d in the division of matrimonial assets (at [51], citing the decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh s/o Jaswant Singh v Sita Jaswant Kaur</Emphasis> [2014] 3 SLR 1284 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis>\u201d)). However, the Judge held that <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis> had to be \u201capplied in a nuanced manner\u201d. She explained that the Court of Appeal in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis> had only meant to say that the court would be slow to vary a division agreed upon by the parties in a postnuptial agreement <Emphasis type=\"i\">if</Emphasis> it were first satisfied that the parties had \u201cfactored all the contributions of each party\u201d in arriving at the division (at [52]). One situation, she postulated, in which it might be said that the contributions of all parties had not been adequately accounted for was where the parties\u2019 continuing indirect contributions to the marriage \u201care expected to subsist by reason of obligations under the marital agreement until a final judgment of divorce\u201d but were not taken into account in the division. In such a case, it would \u201cgenerally be inequitable for one party to not sufficiently recognise these indirect contributions\u201d (at [53]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"11\" pID=\"p1_11\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the facts, the Judge held that the division arrived at in the Deed failed to account for the \u201cprospective (and continuing) indirect contributions of the [wife] as a caregiver to the child\u2026 [from the date of the Deed] until the point where Final Judgment will be entered\u201d (at [59]). She noted that under the Deed, the wife was vested with the primary responsibility of caring for the child after the date of the Deed and that she was also entitled to relocate to start a new life with the child overseas (at [60]). In the circumstances, she concluded that the division arrived at in the Deed was not fair and equitable and ordered that it be varied to provide that the wife should be given 6% of the net value of the matrimonial home, which amounted to a sum of $100,000, instead of a sum of $40,000 agreed on in the Deed (at [60] and [70]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the issue of maintenance for the child, she held that the sum of $1,500 provided for in the Deed was adequate to cover the child\u2019s living expenses (at [78]). However, she noted that no specific provision was made for the husband to pay for the child\u2019s accommodation. Given that the husband was established in Singapore and financially better off than the wife, she agreed with the District Judge that he ought to bear half the cost of renting the apartment in which the wife and child were staying (at [83] and [85]). Thus, she varied the terms of the Deed to provide that the husband was to pay a total sum of $3,375 to the wife each month: $1,500 in maintenance for the child and $1,875 as the share of the rent attributable to the child (see the Supplemental Judgment at [4]). She declined to make provision for graduated increases in maintenance as the child grew older (as was provided for in the Deed), holding that such adjustments as might be necessary could be made by way of separate applications in the future (at [88]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">On the issue of care and control, the Judge favoured the preservation of the <Emphasis type=\"i\">status quo</Emphasis>. She noted that the child was about to enter primary education and so it would be \u201cwholly impractical to layer the complexity of the child\u2019s life with a shared care and control arrangement\u201d (at [109]). In the circumstances, she upheld the terms of the Deed. She awarded joint custody to both parties, but granted care and control to the wife with liberal rights of access for the husband (at [110]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The parties\u2019 arguments on appeal</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Mr Ranjit Singh, counsel for the husband, submits that the Judge had erred insofar as she had departed from the terms of the Deed on the issues of division and maintenance. He stresses that the parties were represented by solicitors throughout the process of negotiation and that the wife had the opportunity to and did in fact make changes to the Deed.

He accepts that the parties should continue to have joint custody but argues that the husband is a devoted father who is committed to playing an active role in the child\u2019s life and \u201cdeserves\u201d to share in the care and control of the child. To that end, he seeks an order for shared care and control to allow the husband to \u201cplay a larger role in the child\u2019s life\u201d and to maintain the integrity of the father-child bond which the child has enjoyed thus far. He contends this would not, contrary to what the Judge had held, lead to excessive disruption in the child\u2019s life since both parties live close to each other.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"16\" pID=\"p1_16\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Ms Bernice Loo, counsel for the wife, argues to the contrary on all points. She submits that the wife has made, and continues to make, substantial non-financial contributions to the family and the welfare of the child which had not been reflected in the division in the Deed. This, she contends, suffices as a \u201cgood reason\u201d for departing from the terms of the Deed. Further, she argues that if the structured approach towards division set out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ v ANK</Emphasis> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ</Emphasis>\u201d) were applied, the wife would have been awarded a proportion of the matrimonial assets far in excess of the 6% she has been awarded by the Judge.

She therefore argues that the Deed is clearly not in the best interests of the child and that the Judge was justified in adjusting its terms. Given the significant disparity between the financial position of the husband and that of the wife\u2019s, she further contends that the Judge was right in ordering that the husband shoulder half the cost of renting the apartment in which the wife and the child currently reside.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Finally, Ms Loo submits that the Judge\u2019s decision that care and control remain with the wife was entirely in keeping with the child\u2019s best interests. She argues that an order for shared care and control would be excessively disruptive for the child, particularly since the parties have markedly different parenting styles. She also points out that the access granted to the husband by the order of the Judge has already accorded him significant and substantial access to the child.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Our decision</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"19\" pID=\"p1_19\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Having carefully considered the arguments presented by the parties, we allow the appeal in part.

There is no appeal against any of these findings, and the parties do not dispute that these are the bases upon which this appeal should proceed. The substantial question which presents itself for decision, therefore, is the weight that should be accorded to the Deed in the division exercise.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">The statutory framework under s 112 of the Charter</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"21\" pID=\"p1_21\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Section 112(1) of the Charter empowers the court, whether in the grant of a judgment of divorce or subsequent to it, to order the division of matrimonial assets in such proportions as it thinks \u201cjust and equitable\u201d. In the exercise of this power, the court is enjoined to take into account the non-exhaustive list of factors listed in s 112(2) of the Charter, one of which is the existence of \u201cany agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce.\u201d As this court clarified in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis> at [43], postnuptial agreements fall within the ambit of this section. In a critical passage, Judith Prakash J, delivering the judgment of the court, explained that while the presence of an agreed distribution was only one of the many factors that the court was to take into account, in the right circumstances, the weight to be given to it may well be conclusive (at [49]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"i\">Although the Judge is correct that under s\u00a0112(2) of the Charter, the presence of an agreement between the parties in regard to distribution of assets is only listed as one of the factors to be considered, with respect, this does not mean that, in all circumstances, such an agreement would have no greater weight than any other of the listed factors.</Emphasis> The factors are a guide to the court, not a mandatory list of items that must be ticked off and given equal weight if they exist. To follow such a course would lead to a mechanistic process of division which would not always be fair. <Emphasis type=\"i\">The discretion given to the court to achieve a just and fair distribution means that if the facts warrant it one or more factors may be given more weight than the others and even primacy over the others.

As this court explained in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis> at [52], such agreements generally carry \u201csignificant weight\u201d because, in preparing a postnuptial agreement, the parties would be addressing their minds towards the exigencies of the present moment (the impending reality of divorce), rather than some future (and perhaps even quite remote) contingency. The court held that \u201cwhere parties have properly and fairly come to a formal separation agreement with the benefit of legal advice, the court will generally attach significant weight to that agreement [when deciding on the division of their matrimonial assets] unless there are <Emphasis type=\"i\">good and substantial grounds for concluding that to do so would effect injustice</Emphasis>\u201d [emphasis added] (at [54]). The question, for present purposes, is whether such grounds exist. In our judgment, they do not.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">No good and substantial grounds for concluding that the division in the Deed would effect injustice</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The only injustice highlighted in the Judgment was the fact that the Deed did not appear to take into account the continuing role that the wife would play in caring for the child from the date of the Deed until the date of final judgment. The Judge held that the sum of $40,000 awarded to the wife only reflected the parties\u2019 relative contributions up till the date of the Deed (21 April 2009) and therefore did not adequately take into account the wife\u2019s continuing indirect contributions to the marriage until its final dissolution (at [59]). She therefore concluded that the Deed did not reflect a fair and equitable distribution and should be varied (at [60]). We respectfully disagree with the Judge that this constitutes a sufficient basis for varying the agreed distribution. We give three reasons for this.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">First, we do not agree that in a case like the present the parties\u2019 post-Deed activities should be taken into account in determining what the appropriate division of their matrimonial assets ought to be. In particular, we disagree with the Judge that the cut-off point for the determination of the parties\u2019 contributions to the marriage for the purposes of the division exercise ought to be the date of the final judgment of divorce. In our opinion, this is a case in which the operative date for determining the parties\u2019 respective contributions to the marriage ought to be the date of the conclusion of the Deed (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, 21 April 2009) because that was when the marriage effectively came to an end. Thereafter the parties were only waiting for time to elapse before filing for divorce.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"25\" pID=\"p1_25\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In <Emphasis type=\"i\">ARY v ARX and another appeal</Emphasis> [2016] 2 SLR 686 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">ARY</Emphasis>\u201d), this court examined the principles to be applied in determining the \u201coperative date\u201d for use in ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets. After an extensive review of the relevant authorities, the court held that the starting point should be the date of interim judgment for that was when there was \u201cno longer any matrimonial home, no <Emphasis type=\"i\">consortium vitae</Emphasis> and no right on either side to conjugal rights\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">ARY</Emphasis> at [32], citing the previous decision of this court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah and another</Emphasis> [1987] SLR(R) 702 at [25]). Where these factors are present, it may be said that the marriage has come to an end and it would be \u201cartificial to speak of any asset acquired <Emphasis type=\"i\">after</Emphasis> the interim judgment has been granted as being a matrimonial asset\u201d [emphasis in original] (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ARY</Emphasis> at [32]). Although the specific issue before the court in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ARY</Emphasis> was different (the composition of the pool of marital assets, rather than the cut-off date for determining the parties\u2019 contributions to the marriage), the crux of the inquiry is the same. The question is whether the marriage still exists in any meaningful sense such that the actions of the parties, whether in the acquisition of assets, the care of their children, or otherwise, may properly be said to have been done during the subsistence of the marriage and should therefore be taken into account in the division exercise. We therefore apply the <Emphasis type=\"i\">ARY</Emphasis> principles here.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"26\" pID=\"p1_26\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">When one examines the Deed, it is clear that the parties\u2019 marital relationship had come to a close with the conclusion of the Deed. The three indicia of termination set out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ARY</Emphasis> are all present: (a) there is no longer a matrimonial home \u2013 the wife was to move out of the matrimonial home and both would henceforth live in separate apartments; (b) there is no <Emphasis type=\"i\">consortium vitae</Emphasis> \u2013 the parties were to live \u201cas if each were single\u201d and would be \u201cfree from the marital control (if any) of the other\u201d (see [5] above); and (c) neither party had conjugal rights \u2013 it was expressly stated that neither party could \u201crequire the other to cohabit with him or her and vice versa\u201d (likewise at [5] above). The parties recognised it as such and it is clear that as far as they were concerned the only thing left to be done after the conclusion of the Deed was to wait for time to elapse so that either one or the other could file the papers for divorce on the ground of three years\u2019 separation.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"27\" pID=\"p1_27\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the circumstances, it is artificial to say that after the conclusion of the Deed, the wife should still be given credit for her \u201cindirect contributions\u2026 as a caregiver to the child\u201d (see the Judgment at [59]). We do not, for a moment, wish to undervalue the role played by the wife in caring for the child but the point is that following the conclusion of the Deed, everything the wife did for the child, she did <Emphasis type=\"i\">qua</Emphasis> mother, and no longer <Emphasis type=\"i\">qua</Emphasis> spouse. The parties, particularly the wife, would have known that she would have to bear the brunt of bringing up the child and moreover that was what she wanted to do too. That was why the Deed was structured the way it was. There is therefore no injustice in the fact that the Deed did not appear to take the wife\u2019s continuing role as primary caregiver to the child into account in determining her share of the matrimonial assets.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"28\" pID=\"p1_28\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Second, and even assuming that we could regard the wife taking care of the child post the conclusion of the Deed as contributions she made <Emphasis type=\"i\">qua</Emphasis> spouse (on the basis that the parties were still legally married), we do not \u2013 with respect to the Judge (see the Judgment at [59]) \u2013 agree that that was a factor which the parties had not taken into consideration when entering into the Deed. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the parties would have known that after the separation the wife would be the main caregiver of the child; that was what the wife desired and the parties would have addressed their minds to this factor in the agreed division of their matrimonial assets. To say that the parties had not considered that factor is to ignore the obvious, bearing particularly in mind the manner in which the Deed was drawn up.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"29\" pID=\"p1_29\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It must be noted that the agreement reached in the Deed was the product of lengthy negotiations between the parties who were both legally represented throughout the five-month process.

Opportunities were given to the wife to propose alterations and she did. Some of them were accepted, <Emphasis type=\"i\">eg</Emphasis>, the settlement sum was increased from $30,000 to $40,000. As we noted above at [20], the Judge held that there were no vitiating factors and there is no appeal against this decision. Unless there are vitiating factors, it seems to us that the appropriate conclusion to be drawn is that the Deed reflected what both parties thought was fair and reasonable, bearing in mind the parties\u2019 agreement that the wife would be the child\u2019s primary caregiver following the date of the Deed.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"30\" pID=\"p1_30\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Finally, we consider that the Judge had not given adequate consideration to the principle that agreements (even marital agreements) must be kept. In her analysis of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis>, the Judge said that the case stood for the narrow proposition that \u201ca court should be slow to vary the marital agreement on the ground that it would have given a different percentage taking into account those <Emphasis type=\"i\">very same contributions</Emphasis> made during the marriage which are typically assessed retrospectively\u201d [emphasis in original] (see the Judgment at [52]). Implicit in this is the assumption that a marital agreement is only useful insofar as it represents the parties\u2019 assessment of their direct and indirect contributions to the marriage. With respect, we hold that this is too narrow a reading of the <Emphasis type=\"i\">ratio</Emphasis> of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis>.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"31\" pID=\"p1_31\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">It is a matter of common sense and justice that the existence of an agreement for the division of matrimonial assets in contemplation of divorce should be accorded due weight when the court decides what is a just and equitable distribution. But what is perhaps less clear is that there are two distinct and separate reasons for this. The first is that the agreed division provides a useful tool for the court to determine what the proper proportions of the parties\u2019 relative direct and indirect contributions to the marriage were. The assumption is that the parties who are negotiating (particularly where they are represented by solicitors) do so rationally and with full knowledge of their respective contributions to the marriage and what they agree on must represent what in their view is a just and equitable distribution. This was what this court had in mind when it stated at [54] of <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis> that \u201cthe parties to a marriage are in the best position to determine what is a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets based on their own assessment of each party\u2019s direct and indirect contributions\u201d and that, due to the \u201cinherent limitations of fact-finding in the litigation process\u201d, the court would readily defer to the parties\u2019 assessment on this matter.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"32\" pID=\"p1_32\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The second has to do with the principle that promises are binding and agreements must be kept. This is an elementary principle of justice and fairness. Simply put, if parties have reached an agreement on division which they have <Emphasis type=\"i\">freely and advisedly entered into</Emphasis>, then it is surely \u201cjust and equitable\u201d that the terms of this agreement are adhered to. We recognise that the distributions accepted in a postnuptial agreement will not necessarily reflect what the parties would have received had they gone to court for adjudication. However, this can hardly be surprising. All settlement agreements, no less marital agreements, are a product of compromise. The distributions entered into reflect the benefits, both tangible (in terms of saved legal costs) and intangible (the psychological value of repose), of dispute avoidance. Parties often accept less than what they would otherwise properly be entitled to in order to find closure. This is entirely understandable, and it is also to be expected and respected. As Choo Han Teck J aptly observed, albeit in the context of whether a consent order should be rescinded, in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</Emphasis> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 548 at [5] (cited with approval in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis> at [55]):</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\u2026 Privately settled terms in respect of the ancillary matters in a divorce may not always appear to be fair.

Taking these points into account, it seems to us that significant weight should be attached to the Deed, both because it is an indication of what the parties thought was just and equitable, given their respective direct and indirect contributions to the marriage (which no one knows better than themselves), and also because it represents the product of a considered compromise which was reached after a period of negotiations attended by legal advice and should be given full effect.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Conclusion on the issue of division</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"34\" pID=\"p1_34\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the foregoing reasons, in our judgment, there are no \u201cgood and substantial grounds\u201d to conclude that the present arrangement would effect injustice. On the contrary, we are of the view that this is a case in which the division agreed upon carries almost conclusive weight and should be accorded primacy. We therefore reinstate the original terms of the Deed and hold that the husband should only be liable to pay the wife $40,000 as her share of the matrimonial assets. In accordance with the Deed, the payments already made to the wife under cll 3.1 and 3.2 of the Deed (that is, the upfront payment of $10,000 made on 19 November 2008 and the deposit of $5,400 paid for the apartment which the wife and child moved into immediately after the parties\u2019 separation and which she was entitled to retain when she moved out) are to be deducted from this sum of $40,000.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"35\" pID=\"p1_35\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Given our analysis on this issue, it is not necessary for us to analyse this case along the lines of the framework set out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ</Emphasis>, as the parties have done in their respective cases. On this point, we wish only to reiterate what we said at [28] of <Emphasis type=\"i\">ANJ</Emphasis>, which was that the approach we set out there is \u201cgermane to the general run of matrimonial cases where the parties\u2019 direct and indirect contributions are the only two factors engaged\u201d and the court is asked to determine the matter of the division of matrimonial cases <Emphasis type=\"i\">de novo</Emphasis>. This is not such a case. Here, there is a detailed postnuptial agreement. We therefore consider that the more appropriate methodology is to examine the division set out in the Deed before determining whether any alterations are necessary, and that is how we have approached this issue.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"36\" pID=\"p1_36\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We might be prepared to agree with Ms Loo where she contends that a different result might be reached if this court were to determine the matter of division afresh without reference to the Deed. However, this is not enough. As we emphasised in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Surindar Singh</Emphasis> at [56], the fact that a court \u201cmight have made a different distribution than that agreed to [by the parties]\u201d is not a sufficient basis for saying that there is injustice which warrants a departure from an agreed distribution. Instead, \u201c[t]he grounds for disregarding such a separation agreement would have to be more substantial than a slight difference of opinion on the fairness of the distribution provided for by the agreement.\u201d No such grounds are present here.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Maintenance for the child</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"37\" pID=\"p1_37\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We turn now to the issue of maintenance for the child. The Judge approached this issue in two parts. She first began by considering how much the husband ought to contribute towards the child\u2019s personal and household expenses. She rejected the wife\u2019s submission of $2,790 as excessive and held that a sum of $1,500 be ordered instead. She then turned to consider the issue of the child\u2019s accommodation as a separate matter. She rejected the wife\u2019s submission that the husband ought to bear the full cost of the rental and instead held that \u201cin principle, the [husband] has to provide accommodation for the child and bear one half of the rent of an accommodation\u201d (see the Judgment at [81]).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"38\" pID=\"p1_38\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband appeals only against that part of the Judge\u2019s order that provides that he is to shoulder half of the cost of renting the apartment the wife and child are currently staying in; he takes no issue with the order that he pay a sum of $1,500 for the child\u2019s living expenses. Mr Singh points out that the Deed clearly contemplates that the husband\u2019s obligation to pay for rent would cease after November 2011 and submits that it would be unfair to allow the wife to renege on the Deed since it was part of a comprehensive settlement in which the husband was obliged to and did pay for the full cost of renting an apartment for the first three years after the parties\u2019 separation. He therefore contends that the husband should only be liable to pay $1,500 for the child\u2019s maintenance each month.

We will first examine the general duty of parents to maintain their children before considering what role marital agreements play in this area. Finally, we will consider whether the quantum of maintenance ordered by the Judge in this case is appropriate.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">The statutory framework under the Charter</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"40\" pID=\"p1_40\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The central principle is that each biological parent has an independent and non-derogable duty to maintain his/her children, whether directly, through the provision of such necessities as the child may need, or indirectly, by contributing to the cost of providing such necessities. This duty is statutorily embodied in s 68 of the Charter, which provides as follows:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall be the <Emphasis type=\"i\">duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children</Emphasis>, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other person, and whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, either <Emphasis type=\"i\">by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof</Emphasis>.

However, for present purposes, we will only focus on the duties of biological parents, for that is what the present appeal is concerned with.</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"41\" pID=\"p1_41\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Section 68 states that a parent\u2019s duty is to provide what is \u201creasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life\u201d. This is buttressed by s\u00a069(4) of the Charter, which specifically directs the court to have regard to \u201call the circumstances of the case\u201d, including, among other things, the income and earning capacities of the wife and child in deciding what sum to order in maintenance. Undergirding these provisions is the principle which we would, to borrow an expression from another area of the law, call the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">TIT v TIU and another appeal</Emphasis> [2016] SGHCF 8 at [61]). The Charter clearly contemplates that parents may contribute in different ways and to different extents in the discharge of their common duty to provide for their children.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"42\" pID=\"p1_42\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">So where do marital agreements which relate to the maintenance of children come in? In our view, such agreements are relevant where the court is determining what <Emphasis type=\"i\">quantum</Emphasis> of maintenance to order. While the existence of any marital agreement is <Emphasis type=\"i\">not</Emphasis> one of the statutorily prescribed factors in s 69(4) of the Charter, the expression \u201call the circumstances of the case\u201d is wide enough to encompass the presence of a marital agreement which relates to the maintenance of children. We would not place too fine a point on this save to say that the precise weight to be ascribed to the existence of such an agreement must depend on the facts of each case. However, there are two important principles which we ought to reiterate.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"43\" pID=\"p1_43\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The first principle is that the welfare of the child is the overriding objective. In <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR and another appeal</Emphasis> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis>\u201d) at [61] and [68], this court stressed that all postnuptial agreements with respect to maintenance (both those made in respect of wives and those for children) are subject to the <Emphasis type=\"i\">continuing</Emphasis> scrutiny of the courts and that the primary consideration was \u201cthe provision of <Emphasis type=\"i\">adequate</Emphasis> maintenance\u201d [emphasis in original] (at [67]). What this means is that the court will not sanction any agreement as to maintenance if its <Emphasis type=\"i\">overall</Emphasis> effect would leave the child with inadequate support. In particular, it was said that the courts would be \u201cespecially vigilant and will be slow to enforce agreements that are apparently not in the best interests of the child or the children concerned\u201d (likewise at [67]). While this statement was made with specific reference to a prenuptial agreement (which was what <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis> was concerned with), we consider that it applies with equal, if not greater, force where the court is faced with a postnuptial agreement. As pointed out in <Emphasis type=\"i\">TBC v TBD</Emphasis> [2015] 4 SLR 59 at [27], it is entirely proper that in some cases, one parent may contribute more than another where it is necessary to ensure that the child \u201cwill receive the full measure of maintenance\u201d.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"44\" pID=\"p1_44\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The second principle is that the courts will not allow a parent to abdicate his/her responsibility of parental support. For that reason, we were careful to state that a marital agreement may be relevant to the question of the <Emphasis type=\"i\">quantum</Emphasis> of support, but not its <Emphasis type=\"i\">existence</Emphasis>. Even though s 68 of the Charter begins with the phrase \u201c[e]xcept where an agreement\u2026 otherwise provides\u201d, a parent cannot contract out of the obligation to provide for his/her child. As pointed out in Leong Wai Kum, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Elements of Family Law</Emphasis> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Elements of Family Law</Emphasis>\u201d) at p 409, this proviso must be read in conjunction with s 73 of the Charter, which empowers the courts to vary the terms of any agreement relating to the maintenance of a child if it is satisfied \u201cthat it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so\u201d.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"45\" pID=\"p1_45\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As this court has stressed in <Emphasis type=\"i\">CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</Emphasis> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 690 at [26], the \u201cidea of joint parental responsibility is deeply rooted in our family law jurisprudence.\u201d In the same paragraph, it was observed that the welfare of the child was best advanced if both parents played an active role in the upbringing of the child, even if they might not continue to live together. We affirm this principle and we hold that it applies with equal force to the area of material provision. <Emphasis type=\"i\">Even if</Emphasis> one parent were fully capable of providing for the child\u2019s material needs, it would still be in the best interests of the child, and consistent with the schema of the Charter as a whole, that the law recognises and enforces the joint responsibility of both parents to maintain the child. This is in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities which we referred to at [41] above.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"46\" pID=\"p1_46\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">To sum up, we would put the matter in the following way. Where the parties have clearly addressed their minds to the question of the need to provide and care for the child, and the overall provision is a just and fair result that does not fall short of what is needed and expected under the general law, then there is nothing preventing the court from endorsing the substance of the terms of the agreement (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis> at [67]). However, if the agreement would leave the child with inadequate support, or if the burdens of parenthood are so unevenly distributed that it is inconsistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the court will readily step in to fashion a different set of orders to achieve a just and fair outcome that serves the child\u2019s best interests.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"47\" pID=\"p1_47\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">From the foregoing, it is clear that the position taken in respect of division of assets (where a marital agreement can be given almost conclusive weight in some circumstances: see [33] above) is different from that taken in the case of maintenance (where the court is comparatively more cautious about accepting the agreements made by the parties). This might appear incongruous, but it should not surprise. The reason lies in the different objectives being pursued and the different roles assumed by the courts in each area.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"48\" pID=\"p1_48\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Where the court is considering the issue of division of assets, the focus is on the <Emphasis type=\"i\">proprietary entitlements</Emphasis> of the parties to the marriage <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter se</Emphasis>. No interests of third parties like children are at stake. It therefore stands to reason that any agreement which has been freely and voluntarily entered into by the parties upon legal advice should be almost determinative of the outcome and the role of the court is greatly circumscribed: it is there only to ensure that the agreement would not effect injustice. In contrast, where the court is considering the issue of maintenance for the child, the focus of the court\u2019s inquiry is the <Emphasis type=\"i\">financial needs of the child</Emphasis> \u2013 a <Emphasis type=\"i\">third party</Emphasis> who had no say in the conclusion of the agreement but whose interests are nevertheless directly implicated. In this context, the court assumes a more prominent custodial role and the overriding objective is that the welfare of the child must be safeguarded and adequate provision must be made for his/her upkeep.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"49\" pID=\"p1_49\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In light of the foregoing, the question is whether the quantum of maintenance agreed in the Deed ($1,500 per month) is a reasonable sum that adequately addresses the child\u2019s need for adequate support and discharges the husband\u2019s obligation to provide for the child\u2019s material needs (<Emphasis type=\"i\">including</Emphasis> the child\u2019s need for accommodation). In our judgment, it does not.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Does the Deed set out a just and fair maintenance order?</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"50\" pID=\"p1_50\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">First, it is clear that the provision in the Deed for the child\u2019s upkeep would leave her with inadequate support. The apartment in which the wife and child reside costs $3,750 a month in rent. While there was some dispute as to the wife\u2019s income, the Notice of Assessment issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore for 2013 lists the wife\u2019s gross annual income at almost $37,000 (or approximately $3,100 per month). It is clear that without significant financial contribution from the husband, the wife and child will not be able to continue staying at the apartment. In the court below, the husband argued that the wife ought to be looking at cheaper accommodation. The Judge disagreed on the basis that the apartment in which the wife and child resided was close to her school and the husband\u2019s home (see the Judgment at [81]). There has been no appeal against this decision and we see no reason to disturb this finding. In principle, therefore, we would hold that any maintenance order that is made should \u2013 so far as it is possible, having regard to the husband\u2019s means \u2013 allow the child to continue staying at her present apartment.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"51\" pID=\"p1_51\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband has, since the grant of interim judgment on 24 April 2012, been paying a sum of $2,950 to the wife each month (see [4] above). While he contends that he has had to dip into his savings to meet this obligation, there is no indication that this has caused him substantial hardship or that he is unable to continue making such a contribution. Of course, should the husband\u2019s financial situation continue to deteriorate, it might be open for him to apply for a variation of the order. In that event, all parties concerned will have to adapt to the changed circumstances. But until and unless that happens, we hold that the present maintenance order of $3,375 is not unreasonable in the circumstances.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"52\" pID=\"p1_52\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Second, we are of the view that the present maintenance order does not respect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The husband\u2019s concession that this sum <Emphasis type=\"i\">only</Emphasis> reflects his obligation to provide for the child <Emphasis type=\"i\">sans</Emphasis> rental, in our view, settles the issue. The fact that the Deed states that the husband would not be obliged to pay the cost of accommodating the wife and the child after 14 November 2011 is of little moment. Section 68 of the Charter requires the husband to provide for \u201csuch accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable\u201d. As a matter of principle, the husband can no more contract out of his obligation to provide the child with adequate accommodation than he can contract out of his obligation to maintain the child entirely. It has long been held, since the decision of the House of Lords in <Emphasis type=\"i\">Hyman v Hyman</Emphasis> [1929] AC 601 (\u201c<Emphasis type=\"i\">Hyman</Emphasis>\u201d), that the jurisdiction of the court to make provisions for maintenance consequent upon a divorce cannot be abridged by the private agreement of the parties. Although <Emphasis type=\"i\">Hyman</Emphasis> concerned the right of a wife to maintenance, we consider that this applies, <Emphasis type=\"i\">a fortiori</Emphasis>, where the maintenance of children is concerned. The right of a child to adequate support is, to borrow the words of Lord Atkin, a \u201cmatter of public concern, which [the parties] cannot barter away\u201d (see <Emphasis type=\"i\">Hyman</Emphasis> at 629).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"53\" pID=\"p1_53\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The wife relocated to Singapore only to be with the husband and she did not work until after the parties had separated. Since then, she has taken on a variety of jobs, most recently as a real estate agent. Her monthly income, as determined by IRAS, does not exceed $3,100 a month. The assets in her sole name amount to approximately $31,500. In contrast, the husband is well-established in Singapore and has substantial savings. While he contends that his business is not doing well, it cannot be disputed that he was, and continues to be, a man of substantial means, with assets in excess of $6.5m (see the Judgment at Annex A). In our judgment, it would not be a just and fair apportionment of financial responsibilities for the wife to shoulder the full cost of the rent for the apartment, bearing in mind particularly that she is the child\u2019s primary caregiver and is less well off than the husband.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"54\" pID=\"p1_54\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The question then is what proportion of the rental of $3,750 the husband ought additionally to bear, given the need of the child for a roof over her head. The Judge first noted that the wife would have to be liable for at least a part of the rent since she would also be staying in the apartment. On that basis, the Judge concluded that the fairest order in the circumstances would be to require the husband and the wife to share the total cost of the accommodation equally. When we looked at the matter in the round, we saw no reason to disturb this ruling. It seems to us that this is a just apportionment, having regard to, among other things, the financial capacities of the parties and the present and future contributions of each to the continuing welfare of the child. In the premises, we uphold the order made by the Judge at [4] of the Supplemental Judgment, which is that the husband is to pay the wife a sum of $3,375 a month, comprising $1,500 for the child\u2019s living expenses and $1,875 being half share of the current rent of $3,750 for the apartment.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"2\" align=\"left\">Care and control</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"55\" pID=\"p1_55\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The last issue concerns care and control. Ms Loo points out, as a preliminary point, that the husband, despite having hitherto been so concerned with the strict enforcement of the terms of the Deed, has quickly abandoned that position in the consideration of the question of care and control. She contends that the husband must not be allowed to \u201ccherry pick\u201d the parts of the Deed he wishes to enforce while disregarding others. This is a fair point. However, the point cuts both ways. <Emphasis type=\"i\">Both</Emphasis> the parties had taken positions which were at variance from the Deed from day one. For instance, even before divorce proceedings had been filed, the parties had sought sole custody and care and control of the child under the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cGIA\u201d). Even now, the wife seeks to uphold the Judge\u2019s orders, which do not exactly track the terms of the Deed.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"56\" pID=\"p1_56\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The Judge took the position that once the parties were within the matrimonial jurisdiction of the court, the court was entitled to consider the matters of custody and care and control afresh (see the Judgment at [98] and [100]). While she did not explicitly say so, it was clear from the way she approached the issue that she did not think herself bound by the terms of the Deed, for she did not make reference to it in the course of her treatment of this subject. Instead, her approach was to \u201cmake an order that ensures that the child\u2019s interests are treated as and made paramount\u201d (at [99]). In our judgment, both the Judge\u2019s approach and her eventual decision on this issue cannot be faulted.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">Marital agreements and the custody of children </Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"57\" pID=\"p1_57\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the case of the division of matrimonial assets (and, to a lesser extent, the maintenance of the child), the substance of the question is one of finances. As the issue is merely one which relates to the ownership of property, or the distribution of the financial burdens of parents <Emphasis type=\"i\">inter se</Emphasis>, understandably the court would be inclined towards playing a comparatively minor role. However, where the court is concerned with questions of custody and care and control, the subject is not wholly pecuniary but the welfare of a child. A child\u2019s welfare is not something to be bartered or negotiated at the termination of a marriage. Thus, where the court decides on questions of custody and care and control, it always acts to maximise the welfare of the child, which is the \u201cparamount consideration\u201d (s 125(2) of the Charter).</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"58\" pID=\"p1_58\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For this reason, while the court is enjoined to have regard to the wishes of the parents and of the child, it is not bound by anything that might be set out in a marital agreement. Indeed, in <Emphasis type=\"i\">TQ v TR</Emphasis> at [70], this court held that there ought to be a presumption that all agreements (whether prenuptial or postnuptial) relating to the custody or care and control of children are unenforceable unless it is \u201cclearly demonstrated by the party relying on the agreement that the agreement is in the <Emphasis type=\"i\">best interests</Emphasis> of the child\u201d [emphasis in original]. The reason for this, as the court explained in the same paragraph, is that in the heat of the matrimonial dispute, the interests of the child may unwittingly be relegated to second place. Thus, the court treats the terms of any such agreement with great circumspection and will not give effect to them unless it is satisfied that to do so would be in the best interests of the child. In the circumstances, we approach this matter by considering, as the Judge did, what is in the best interests of the child.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"3\" align=\"left\">The best interests of the child</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"59\" pID=\"p1_59\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Mr Singh argued that an order for shared care and control would allow the husband greater say and allow him to play an \u201cactive role\u201d in the child\u2019s life. The problem with this argument, as we pointed out during the hearing, is that the husband\u2019s access arrangements, which have been in place since January 2015, are generous and grant the husband extremely liberal access to the child. The child spends half of the school holidays in the care of the husband. During the school term, the agreed schedule is structured as follows:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"ul\">Week 1</Emphasis>\n          </Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(1)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Tuesday from 1.30pm to 7.30pm;</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(2)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Thursday from 1.30pm to 7.30pm;</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(3)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Friday from 1.30pm to 7.30pm;</Text>\n          </Item>\n        </QuoteList>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">\n            <Emphasis type=\"ul\">Week 2</Emphasis>\n          </Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <QuoteList level=\"1\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(1)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Tuesday from 1.30pm to 7.30pm;</Text>\n          </Item>\n          <Item>\n            <Label>(2)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Overnight access from Friday 1.30pm to Sunday 7.30pm</Text>\n          </Item>\n        </QuoteList>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"60\" pID=\"p1_60\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">If we put aside the time spent in school, it would seem that the child spends almost as much of her leisure time with the husband as she does with the wife. In the circumstances, we agree with Ms Loo that the husband is afforded ample opportunity to play an active role in the child\u2019s life. This is particularly the case when one considers that the parties, as the husband himself pointed out, live very close to each other. We do not see how a shared care and control order would allow the husband to spend very much more time with the child than he currently does, particularly since the order for joint custody (which neither party has challenged) already means that the most important decisions affecting the long-term upbringing and welfare of the child can only be made with the consent of both parties.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"61\" pID=\"p1_61\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Mr Singh conceded that the present arrangements afforded the husband very generous access to the child but submitted that an order for shared care and control would \u201crecognise the role played by the father\u201d. However, we are not persuaded that this provides an adequate basis for a variation of the care and control order, particularly given the disruption it would cause to the child\u2019s life. As the Judge rightly pointed out, continuity in living arrangements is an important factor in maintaining the emotional well-being of a child (see the Judge at [107]). We agree with the Judge that an award for shared care and control would destabilise and be unnecessarily disruptive to the child\u2019s life at this stage, considering that the child has been living with the wife for the past seven years and has just made the transition to primary school.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"62\" pID=\"p1_62\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Furthermore, as we remarked during the hearing, one should not emphasise \u201cform over substance\u201d. It is laudable that the husband wants to be a good father to the child, and we commend him for this. However, the sound and sensible way to achieving that is by continuing to take an active interest in the child\u2019s life during the periods of access, such that when the child comes of age, it will be enduring ties of love and affection rather than a court-ordered apportionment of her time, that forms the substratum of an enduring father-daughter relationship. We were informed during the hearing that the parties had cooperated in the last five years to act in the child\u2019s best interests. We are greatly heartened to hear that. It augurs well for the child\u2019s welfare.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"63\" pID=\"p1_63\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In our judgment, joint custody, coupled with the vesting of care and control in the wife and liberal access to the husband, is the option which is in the best interests of the child.

Having heard arguments of the parties, we dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.<br/><br/><strong><i> The background </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We shall first set out the essential facts in brief which gave rise to the action between the parties. The appellants are a venture company incorporated in Singapore. The respondent company agreed to subscribe for 50 units of shares in  the appellants at US$100,000 per unit. The agreement between the parties provided that half of the amount due (half of US$5m) would be payable on application and the second half would be made on certain specified events. It also provided for the consequences of default:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Provided that the second instalment payment for all subscribers shall be payable at any time upon the Company giving not less than 30 days` prior written notice to each Shareholder specifying the time and place for the payment of the second instalment.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>If a Shareholder fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on its due date, the Directors may at any time thereafter,</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(a) serve a notice on him requiring him to pay the entire unpaid balance together with any interest and expenses that may have accrued. Such notice shall specify a day (not less than 14 days from the date of service of that notice) on or prior to which and the place where payment required by the notice is to be made and if such moneys are not paid on or prior to the date specified in the notice, the Shares in respect of which such notice has been given may be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in respect of such Shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture. Any shares so forfeited may be disposed of by the Directors as they think fit and all proceeds of disposal (if any) shall accrue to the Company. The proceeds of disposal in excess of the unpaid instalment, the accrued interest thereon and any such expenses will not be returned to the Shareholder; and or  </p>\n        <p>(b) commence any legal proceedings or enforce payment of the said unpaid moneys.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>On 12 December 1996, pursuant to the agreement, the appellants allotted shares to the respondents amounting to 50 Units. The first instalment payment of half the value of the 50 Unit, that is US$2.5m, was paid up by the respondents to the appellants upon application. On 30 April 1997, the appellants gave written notice to the respondents requiring that payment of the second instalment of US$2.5m be made by 2 June 1997. The respondents were reminded that failure to make payment might result in the respondents` shares being forfeited as provided for in the agreement. The respondents nevertheless failed to make the second instalment payment.<br/><br/>On 17 June 1997, a further written request was issued by the appellants to the respondents. However, the respondents only made part payment of US$500,000 in September 1997.<br/><br/>On 10 November 1996, the appellants` solicitors wrote to the respondents asking that the latter make payment of the remaining US$2m by 17 November 1997. Again, the respondents were informed in this letter that failure to make payment could result in the forfeiture of their shares as provided for in the agreement. However, the respondents still failed to make payment as required. On 5 December 1997, the respondents wrote to the appellants asking for more time to make payment. On 16 December 1997, the appellants` solicitors enquired when the respondents proposed to pay for the balance. To that, there was no response from the respondents.<br/><br/>Thus, on 27 April 1998, the appellants instituted Suit 623/98, against the respondents seeking specific performance of the agreement, or, in the alternative,  damages. On 4 December 1998, on the appellants` application, the learned Deputy Registrar ruled that there was no defence on the part of the respondents and granted summary judgment to the appellants. He ordered specific performance of the agreement, and that the respondents should pay US$2m to the appellants. On 9 February 1999, the respondents` appeal against the summary judgment was dismissed by the judge-in-chambers.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the summary judgment, the respondents still failed to make the payment as ordered. So on 26 February 1999, the appellants applied for an order that the summary judgment for specific performance be discharged, without prejudice to all the appellants` rights and remedies against the respondents for breach of the agreement, and for an order that damages for breach of the agreement by the respondents be assessed. On 12 March 1999, the court granted the appellants` application.<br/><br/>However, on 1 April 1999, before damages were assessed, the appellants changed their mind and sent a notice of intention to forfeit to the respondents, requiring that the respondents pay the balance sum of US$2m by 22 April 1999, failing which their shares would be forfeited. On 14 April 1999, the appellants sent a second letter rectifying certain errors contained in the previous notice of intention, but without changing the deadline of 22 April 1999. On 26 April 1999, the appellants` board of directors passed a resolution forfeiting the share allotted to the respondents, pursuant to powers conferred under the articles of association. On 3 May 1999, the forfeited shares were cancelled by a members` resolution, and the appellants wrote to inform the respondents accordingly.<br/><br/>Some six months later, on 19 October 1999, the respondents applied to the court seeking equitable relief against forfeiture of their shares in the appellants and for the appellants to expedite their assessment of damages. On 3 December 1999, the assistant registrar dismissed the application. On 13 December 1999, the respondents` previous solicitors M/s Drew &amp; Napier filed a notice of appeal on the respondents` behalf. Three days later their present solicitors, M/s Chee &amp; Teo, took over the conduct of the matter. Under O 56 r 1(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322), the notice of appeal was required to be served on the solicitors M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill, within seven days of filing (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays), namely, by 22 December 1999. However, it was only served on 8 January 2000.<br/><br/>The explanation given by the respondents` solicitor, Teo Chee Seng, as set out in an affidavit, was that he had specifically instructed the litigation secretary of his firm to serve the notice of appeal and the notice of change of solicitors on M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill. He even telephoned her from Hong Kong to confirm that she had done so. However, on 7 January 2000, he discovered that the papers had been wrongly served on M/s Drew &amp; Napier. According to him, the litigation secretary said that the court clerk was on leave and she had asked the despatch clerk to serve the papers instead. She admitted to having given wrong instructions to the despatch clerk. Later that same day on 7 January, at about 6pm, Teo Chee Seng instructed one of his staff to immediately serve the relevant papers on M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill. As the service was effected after 4pm, under the rules of court  it was deemed to have been served on the following day, namely, 8 January 2000 (Saturday). On 10 January 2000 (Monday), the respondents` solicitors filed an application to extend time for service of the notice of appeal.<br/><br/>Lai Siu Chiu J granted the respondents` application for an extension of time to serve the notice of appeal on the appellants and adjourned the substantive hearing of the Registrar`s Appeal to a later date, with the express object of enabling the appellants` solicitor to prepare himself for the substantive argument. [See [2000] 2 SLR 686.] The appellants were dissatisfied with the extension of time granted by Lai Siu Chiu J and thus appealed to us.<br/><br/><strong><i> Decision below </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In coming to her decision, Lai Siu Chiu J held that the principle governing an application to extend time to serve a notice of appeal filed within time was no different from that to extend time to file a notice of appeal. This was because an appeal would only come into being where the notice was both filed and served.<br/><br/>The learned judge felt that there was no general rule that a mistake of the solicitor would never be sufficient to justify an extension of time. Applying the factors which this court in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1991::212:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1991::212:\">  [1991] SLR 212 </a> reaffirmed to be applicable, namely, the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the chances of succeeding on appeal and the degree of prejudice, (hereinafter referred to as `the four factors`), Lai Siu Chiu J noted that the delay in service was about two and a half weeks. It was neither short nor was it prolonged. Service was not effected because of an inadvertent mistake of the litigation secretary. No prejudice was shown to have arisen if an extension of time was granted. It was a case of `wrong service, not non-service.` While accepting that an extension of time should not be granted if the appeal was hopeless, she was not able to say that such was the position here.<br/><br/><strong><i> Appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In the appeal before us, the arguments of counsel for the appellants centred on mainly two of the four factors set out in <strong><i> Pearson </i></strong>, namely, reasons for the delay and merits of the case. Counsel contended that a mistake by a solicitor or his staff could not amount to a sufficient ground for granting an extension of time. Furthermore, there were no merits in the appeal.<br/><br/><strong><i> Reason for the delay </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>As mentioned above, the reason for the delay in the service of the notice of appeal on the appellants was because of the litigation secretary`s mistake in instructing the despatch clerk to serve on the respondents` previous solicitors instead of the appellants` solicitors. So the question that arose for consideration was whether it was correct to say that a mistake by a solicitor or his staff could never be a sufficient ground for granting an extension of time for the purpose of filing/serving a notice of appeal.<br/><br/>The starting point for the consideration of the question must be  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Re Helsby</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1894] 1 QB 742</font> where the Bankruptcy Rules 1886 provided that the Court of Appeal had the power to extend time to file appeal `under special circumstances`. The appeal was not filed within time due to the mistake of the solicitor`s clerk. Lord Halsbury LC held that a blunder by the solicitor`s clerk was not a sufficient ground to extend time. Lopes and Davey LJJ agreed with him.<br/><br/>Next is the celebrated case  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Re Coles and Ravenshear</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1907] 1 KB 1</font> where the relevant rules provided that `no appeal to the Court of Appeal shall, except by special leave of the Court of Appeal, be brought after the expiration of fourteen days.` The notice was not filed within 14 days because of the erroneous views of the solicitors. Collins MR said that if the case were free from authority, he would have allowed the time to be extended. But in view of the decision in <strong><i> Re Helsby </i></strong> he felt bound to follow it. Cozens-Hardy and Farwell LJJ also felt that no extension should be granted. Moreover, Farwell LJ took an even stricter view stating that `a mere slip or blunder on the part of a litigant`s legal adviser cannot entitled him to anything at all` and he also endorsed the following opinion of James LJ expressed in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>International Financial Society v City of Moscow Gas Co</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1877-78] 7 Ch D 241</font>:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The limitation of the time to appeal is a right given to the person in whose favour a judge has decided. I think we ought not to enlarge that time unless under some very special circumstances indeed, that is to say, if there has been any misleading through any conduct of the other side ... or again where some sudden accident which could not have been foreseen - some sudden death, or something of that kind, which accounted for the delay.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Lai Siu Chiu J and counsel for the respondents quite rightly pointed out that these cases concerned rules where `special leave` had to be obtained. Thus, in the Malaysian case  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Cheah Teong Tat v Ho Gee Seng &amp; Ors</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1970:1:31:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1970:1:31:\">  [1970] 1 MLJ 31 </a> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Chin Hua Sawmill Co Sdn Bhd v Tuan Yusoff bin Tuan Mohamed</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1974:1:58:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1974:1:58:\">  [1974] 1 MLJ 58 </a>, where the relevant rules there also prescribed the need for `special leave`, the approach taken in <strong><i> Re Coles &amp; Ravenshear </i></strong> was followed. In <strong><i> Cheah Teong Tat </i></strong>, Barakbah J said that `the mere fact of misunderstanding of the rule is not such a special circumstances as to induce the court to give leave to extend the limit to file notice of appeal.` Similarly, in <strong><i> Chin Hua Sawmill </i></strong>, the Federal Court refused to extend time where it was due to a mistake of the solicitors.<br/><br/>The English rules were amended in 1909 and no `special leave` was needed to bring an appeal out of time. The Malaysian rules also did away with `special leave` in 1980. What was thereafter required was simple leave.<br/><br/>The leading English case on the post-1909 position would appear to be  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Gatti v Shoosmith</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1939] 3 All ER 916</font>. There, owing to a misreading of the rule by the applicant`s solicitors, the applicant was a few days late in entering an appeal. However, the intention to appeal had been notified to the respondent`s solicitors, by letter sent within the time specified by the rule. Sir Wilfred Greene, MR, who delivered the only judgment of the English Court of Appeal, said (at p 919):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... in my opinion under the rule as it now stands, the fact that the omission to appeal in due time was due to a mistake on the part of a legal adviser, may be a sufficient cause  to justify the court in exercising its discretion. I say `may be`, because it is not to be thought that it will necessarily be exercised in every set of facts. Under the law as it was conceived to be before the amendment, such a mistake was considered to be in no circumstances a sufficient ground. What I venture to think is the proper rule which this court must follow is : that there is nothing in the nature of such a mistake to exclude it from being a proper ground for allowing the appeal to be effective though out of time; and whether the matter shall be so treated must depend upon the facts of each individual case.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In <strong><i> Gatti v Shoosmith </i></strong> it would appear that the court decided to grant an extension of time because of three factors. First, the delay in service was only a matter of a few days. Second, the delay was as a result of a misunderstanding of the rules which, to anyone who was reading the rules without having the authorities in mind, `might very well have arisen.` Thirdly, the appellant`s solicitors did within time, notified the respondent`s solicitors by letter of the appellant`s intention to appeal.<br/><br/>This more flexible approach was followed in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Palata Investments Ltd &amp; Ors v Burt &amp; Sinfield Ltd &amp; Ors</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1985] 2 All ER 517</font> where the delay was only a matter of three days. The other party was also informed within time that an appeal would probably be entered. The delay was due to counsel`s overlooking the fact that the prescribed time period had been reduced from six weeks to four weeks. Having had counsel`s advice, the solicitors also took the trouble of verifying it with the <strong><i> Supreme Court Practice </i></strong> but unfortunately the new edition of that publication which did spell out the new rule only arrived a few weeks later. While the English Court of Appeal noted that there were essentially four matters to consider in determining whether an extension should be granted (namely the same four factors) it did not follow that in every such application for extension of time there had to be a pre-appeal hearing in order to consider what were the prospects of success. In some cases it might be material to look into the merits as it would be wrong to give leave to pursue a hopeless appeal but that was not the position in that case. The English Court of Appeal having viewed the whole matter thought that the case was an exceptional one warranting the grant of leave to appeal out of time.<br/><br/>The leading Malaysian case which dealt with the consequence of the change in the rules from `special leave` to just ordinary `leave` was the Supreme Court decision in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Sinnathamby &amp; Anor v Lee Chooi Ying</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1987:1:110:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1987:1:110:\">  [1987] 1 MLJ 110 </a> where the court said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... and because of this change in the law which requires only ordinary leave, it is argued that the mistake of a legal adviser is no longer a ground for refusing an application for extension of time to appeal. In my view, this is not so, for the effect of the change in the law merely widens the court`s unfettered discretion under r 56 ... In view of the change in the law which no longer requires `special leave`, where the mistake of a legal adviser is advanced as the reason for the delay, the court is now free to consider it on its merits in the same manner that the court would exercise its discretion in other cases. Thus, the ruling in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Re Coles &amp; Ravenshear</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1907] 1 KB 1</font> as well as  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Chong Kueng Ying &amp; Ors v Lovis Lavagna</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1972:1:180:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1972:1:180:\">  [1972] 1 MLJ 180 </a>, which excluded the court`s discretion in cases where  the delay was caused by the mistake of a legal adviser, should no longer be applicable after the coming into force of the Supreme Court Rules 1980.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Reverting to our own Rules of Court, O 56 r 1(3) provides that the notice of appeal against a decision of an assistant registrar must be filed within 14 days and be served within seven days after filing. The powers of the court to extend or abridge time are set out in O 3 r 4(1) which reads:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The court may, on such terms as it thinks just, by order extend or abridge the period within which a person is required or authorised by these Rules ... to do any act in any proceedings.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>A provision similar to this was contained in the previous rules of the Supreme Court. The rule leaves the discretion to the court. But of course, the discretion must always be exercised judiciously, having regard to the justice of the case.<br/><br/>One of the earlier Singapore cases which touched on the point on how the court should exercise that discretion to extend time is  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Tan Chai Heng v Yeo Seng Choon</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:::381:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:::381:\">  SLR 381 </a><a href=\"MLJ:1981:1:271:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1981:1:271:\">  [1981] 1 MLJ 271 </a>. There the solicitors omitted to file the notice of appeal in time because the case file had been misplaced during the renovation of the firm`s premises. Applying the principles enunciated in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ratnam v Cumarasamy</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1965:1:228:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1965:1:228:\">  [1965] 1 MLJ 228 </a>, namely, that rules of court must prima facie be obeyed and for the court to extend time there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its discretion, Choor Singh J did not accept that reason as a justifiable excuse.<br/><br/>More recently this court had the occasion to deal with the point in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1991:1:212:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1991:1:212:\">  [1991] 1 SLR 212 </a>. That was an application for an extension of time to appeal against a court order on ancillary matters due to a misreading of the relevant rules of court by the applicant`s solicitors. There, this court ruled that the question of extension of time was a matter of discretion and the four factors had to be considered in determining how the discretion should be exercised. The court did not think that the `misreading` arose out of any difficulty or complexity in the rules although the mistake was nonetheless bona fide. It was purely a misreading. The court also did not think that the applicant`s prospects for success in the appeal were good. Accordingly, it held that the applicant had not shown `grounds sufficient to persuade the court to show sympathy to him.`<br/><br/>In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Vettath v Vettath</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1992:1:1:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1992:1:1:\">  [1992] 1 SLR 1 </a> this court was again asked to consider a similar application. There, the husband instructed his solicitors to appeal against certain ancillary orders of the High Court made in a divorce petition. On the solicitors` suggestion, the husband agreed to brief another solicitor as counsel for the appeal. Confusion arose between the two solicitors as to who should file the notice of appeal, and the period for appeal expired without any notice being filed. The court adopted the test propounded in <strong><i> Pearson </i></strong> and held that the reason for the delay, because of the fault of either or both solicitors, was not sufficient to persuade the court to show sympathy to him.<br/><br/>We agreed with Lai Siu Chiu J that there is no absolute rule of law which prescribes that an error on the part of a solicitor or his staff can never, under any circumstances, be a sufficient ground to grant an extension of time to file a notice  of appeal. Having said that, we do not think it is possible to lay down any hard and fast rules as to the circumstances under which a mistake or error on the part of the solicitor or his staff would be held to be sufficient to persuade the court to show sympathy to the application. It is the overall picture that emerges to the court that would be determinative. However, a mistake, even bona fide, is only one factor in the overall consideration. Such a mistake per se may not be sufficient to enable the court to exercise its discretion in favour of an extension. As illustrations, and no more, we note that two aspects which seem to have considerable bearing in the court`s consideration in <strong><i> Gatti v Shoosmith </i></strong> and <strong><i> Palata Investment v Burt &amp; Sinfield </i></strong> to grant extension were (i) the fact that in each of those two cases, notice within the prescribed time was given to the other side that an appeal would be taken and (ii) the mistake was understandable and not gross. But this is not to say that only where such a notice was given that a blunder by the solicitor or his staff would be viewed sympathetically. There could well be other circumstances. Thus, if there is anything in the High Court decision in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd v Vithya Sri Sumathis</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1999:3:239:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1999:3:239:\">  [1999] 3 SLR 239 </a> which could be read to suggest, although it did not expressly so state, that an error on the part of a solicitor absolutely bars any relief, it is not correct. The decision in <strong><i> Stansfield Business International </i></strong> to refuse an extension of time could well be justified as it was a case of oversight simpliciter, with no other extenuating circumstances, although the merits of the case were strong.<br/><br/><strong><i> Merits of the appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Turning to the question of the merits of the appeal, the respondents had raised a number of issues to contend that relief should be granted against forfeiture. The first concerned the question of adequate notice. Under the terms of the agreement, forfeiture of shares may be effected by the appellants only if not less than 14 days notice is given. The notice of intention to forfeit was given by the appellants` letter dated 1 April 1999, requiring payment by 22 April 1999 of S$2,000,000 when the amount should have been US$2,000,000 and costs of S$4,700 when it should have been S$6,700. The appellants` solicitors sought to correct the errors by their letter dated 14 April 1999 without changing the deadline of 22 April 1999. These facts raised the issue whether a proper notice had been given to the respondents to enable the appellants to forfeit when they sought to forfeit the shares on 26 April 1999.<br/><br/>The second issue concerned the fact that the appellants had obtained judgment against the respondents for damages to be assessed. Having elected their remedies and obtained a judgment, with damages to be assessed, it is arguable that they cannot thereafter change course and seek forfeiture of the shares.<br/><br/>The third point concerned the argument that the forfeiture clause is in fact a penalty clause and is unenforceable.<br/><br/>At this stage of the matter there is no need for this court to go into a full-scale hearing on those issues. Neither is it necessary for us to rule that the respondents would succeed in seeking relief. The threshold is much lower: is the appeal really `hopeless`? Like Lai Siu Chiu J, we did not think so.<br/><br/>The modern law on relief against forfeiture was laid down in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1973]  AC 691</font> where the House of Lords held that the jurisdiction was not confined to the two traditional heads: (i) where it is possible to state that the object of the transaction and of the insertion of the right to forfeit is essentially to secure the payment of money, and (ii) when there is fraud, accident, mistake or surprise. It affirmed (at p 723):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>... the rights of courts of equity in appropriate and limited cases or conditions where the primary object of the bargain is to secure a stated result which can effectively be attained when the matter comes before the court and where the forfeiture provision is added by way of security for the production of that result. The word `appropriate` involves consideration of the conduct of the applicant for relief, in particular, whether this default was wilful, of the gravity of the breaches, and of the disparity between the value of the property of which forfeiture is claimed as compared with the damage caused by the breach.`</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>It seems to us clear that the present case falls within the first of the two traditional heads where the court would have the jurisdiction to grant relief. At this stage, we need not and should not say more.<br/><br/>In the present case, Lai Siu Chiu J did consider all the circumstances in the light of the four factors She noted that the delay was not prolonged. The respondents` solicitors were not tardy in pursuing the appeal. The mistake was bona fide made by the litigation secretary. There was no prejudice to the appellant. She emphasised that this was a case of `wrong service, not non-service.` Finally, she also did not think that the appeal would be `utterly hopeless`.<br/><br/>The judge below having judiciously exercised her discretion, it is not for an appellate court to substitute its own decision for that of the court below unless it is shown that the judge below in exercising his discretion had applied the wrong principle or that the decision has caused a miscarriage of justice in that he had taken into account matters which he ought not to have done or failed to take into account matters which he ought to have done or that the decision was plainly wrong. That is trite law. In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ratnam v Cumarasamy &amp; Anor</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1965:1:228:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1965:1:228:\">  [1965] 1 MLJ 228 </a> the Privy Council said at p 229:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>There is a presumption that the judge has rightly exercised his discretion ...

It cannot interfere simply because its members consider that they would, if themselves sitting at first instance, have reached a different conclusion. It can only interfere in three cases: (1) where the judge has misdirected himself with regard to the principles in accordance with which his discretion had to be exercised; (2) where the judge, in exercising his discretion, has taken into account matters which he ought not to have done or failed to take into account matters which he ought to have done; or (3) where his decision is plainly wrong.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We did not think that Lai Siu Chiu J had erred on a matter of principle and thus declined to interfere in her decision to grant an extension of time.<br/><br/><strong><i> Judgment </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal with costs. The security for costs, together with any accrued interest, was ordered to be paid out to the respondents to account of the latter`s costs.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n    <p>Appeal dismissed.<br/><br/></p>\n  </body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\7\\7\\URJ_[2001]_SGCA_9_v1.0.html\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"4099\" id=\"4099-M\" uniqueid=\"7daa8511-876d-4f99-ae10-c7512040e6a3\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/4099-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2003-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2001-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2001</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>9</No>\n      <NCit>[2001] SGCA 9</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>9</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2001] SGCA 9</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>Leong Mei Chuan v Chan Teck Hock David</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Leong Mei Chuan v Chan Teck Hock David</SortTitle><SortDate>2001-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA 71/2000</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Plaintiff</Role>\n        <Name>Leong Mei Chuan</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#2\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Defendant</Role>\n        <Name>Chan Teck Hock David</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#7\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third Party</Role>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#68\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Chao Hick Tin JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#539\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L P Thean JA</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Tan Hin Tat, Janaine Ong and V Kanyakumari (Sim Hill Tan &amp; Wong) for the appellant</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Anamah Tan and Veronica Ann Joseph (Ann Tan &amp; Associates) for the respondent</Counsel>\n    </Counsels>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#786\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Civil Procedure</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#792\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Appeals</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"3\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#794\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Notice</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Amendment</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Whether application to amend notice of appeal should be allowed</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"6\">O 55C Rules of Court</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n  \n\n<SLR>YES</SLR></Metadata>\n</CaseReport>\n<body>\n    <p>(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): <strong><i> Facts </i></strong><br/><br/>The appellant, Leong Mei Chuan (`Madam Leong`), married the respondent, David Chan Teck Hock (`Mr Chan`) on 21 September 1983 in Singapore. They have three children from this marriage. In 1997 their marriage broke down. On 21 November 1997, Madam Leong filed divorce proceedings in DP 3777/97 against Mr Chan on the ground that the marriage had irretrievably broken down, alleging that Mr Chan had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. A supplemental petition was later filed on 29 July 1998 alleging further that Mr Chan had committed adultery and that Madam Leong found it intolerable to live with him. Mr Chan did not contest the petition, and a decree nisi was granted to Madam Leong on 24 September 1998. The ancillary issues in respect of the custody of children, maintenance of Madam Leong and the children and division of matrimonial assets were adjourned to be heard in chambers. They were subsequently heard in chambers by District Judge Emily Wilfred in November and December 1999. Amongst the issues canvassed before the district judge was the division of certain stock options in Dell Corporation in which Mr Chan was an employee at the material time. These options fell into three broad categories, namely, (1) those that had vested in Mr Chan and had been exercised by him; (2) those that had vested in him but had not been exercised; and (3) those that had not as yet vested.<br/><br/>On 20 January 2000, the district judge delivered her decision on the ancillary issues, and made, among others, the following orders:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>5 The petitioner shall be entitled to 15% of the respondent`s Dell stocks, namely:  </p>\n        <p>(a) 111,100 shares purchased from the open market and valued at US$4,575,986.80 as at 4 November 1999;  </p>\n        <p>(b) 10,821 shares bought from the Employee Stock Purchase Plan valued at US$445,695 as at 4 November 1999;  </p>\n        <p>(c) gains of Dell shares vested and exercised by respondent under the Non-Statutory Option Agreement Scheme, amounting to US$2,573,328 less tax to be paid on such gains (proof of demand of payment from IRAS);  </p>\n        <p>6 There shall be no division of Dell stocks in the Non-Statutory Stock Option Agreements which have yet to be vested in the respondent.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Thus, in relation to Mr Chan`s stock options, the district judge dealt with those stock options that had vested in him and had been exercised by him and those that had not vested. No order, however, was made by her for a division of those stock options that had vested in Mr Chan but had not been exercised by him.<br/><br/>Both Mr Chan and Madam Leong appealed against the decision of the district judge. In the notice of appeal filed by or on behalf of Madam Leong (in RAS 720013/2000) she sought, among other things, an order for the following:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>2 The petitioner be entitled to a greater share than 15% of the respondent`s Dell stocks itemised at Order 5 of the order of court dated 20 January 2000.  </p>\n        <p>3 There be a division of Dell stocks in the Non-Statutory Option agreements which have yet to be vested in the respondent.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Thus, by this notice of appeal, Madam Leong sought only a greater share in the stock options that had vested in Mr Chan and had been exercised by him, and a share in the stock options that had not vested in him. She did not seek an order giving her a share in those stock options that had vested in him but had not been exercised.<br/><br/>Both appeals were set down to be heard by Judith Prakash J on 13 April 2000. However, on 6 April 2000, subsequent to the filing of the notice of appeal, Madam Leong instructed new solicitors to represent her in the appeal. A few days later, on 11 April 2000, the district judge released her grounds of decision. At the hearing before Prakash J on 13 April 2000, Madam Leong`s newly appointed solicitors sought an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal. Prakash J granted the adjournment, but she directed the parties to file appellant`s and respondent`s cases for the appeal and these were to be filed before the appeal was to be heard.<br/><br/>On the same day, by a letter dated 13 April 2000, Madam Leong`s solicitors wrote to Mr Chan`s solicitors informing the latter that they intended to amend the notice of appeal and to raise the arguments pertaining to the division of the stock options that had vested in Mr Chan but had not as yet been exercised by him. This was met with swift riposte from Mr Chan`s solicitors that they would object to such amendment.<br/><br/>In compliance with Prakash J`s direction, both Madam Leong and Mr Chan filed the appellant`s case and the respondent`s case respectively. In the appellant`s case, there was included, among other things, a contention pertaining to the stock options that had vested in Mr Chan but had not been exercised by him. On 9 May 2000, Mr Chan`s solicitors applied by way of SIC 750843/2000 to expunge those parts of the appellant`s case that did not relate to the orders sought for in the notice of appeal filed on 1 February 2000. On the same day, Madam Leong`s solicitors filed an application, SIC 750847, to amend the notice of appeal to include in the orders sought a division of those stock options that have vested in Mr Chan but have not been exercised by him.<br/><br/>Both these applications and the two appeals proper (namely: the appeals filed by Madam Leong and Mr Chan in RAS 720013 and RAS 720014 respectively) came on for hearing before a judge-in-chambers on 22 May 2000. The judge heard first Madam Leong`s application to amend the notice of appeal, and at the conclusion he dismissed it. Madam Leong`s counsel then indicated his client`s  intention to appeal against the dismissal, and the judge adjourned the hearing of Mr Chan`s application to expunge and the two appeals proper, RAS 720013 and RAS 720013, pending the outcome of the appeal.<br/><br/>Madam Leong duly filed her appeal which came on for hearing before us. We allowed her appeal, and now give our reasons.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appeal </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It would be helpful at this stage to say a word concerning the procedures governing appeals from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court, as apart from other considerations taken into account by us in arriving at out decision, this appeal was also considered in the context of the relevant procedure governing the appeal filed by Madam Leong from the decision of the district judge in chambers to the judge of the High Court. In an ordinary appeal to the High Court from the Subordinate Courts, O 55D of the Rules of Court applies and r 3(2) provides that such appeal shall be by way of rehearing and `must be brought by a notice of appeal in Form 114A`, and every notice of appeal must state, among other things, `whether the whole or part only, and what part, of the judgment or order is complained of`. Consistent with this rule, Form 114A which sets out the format for the notice of appeal requires the appellant, if the appeal is against the whole of the decision, to state that he appeals against the whole of it or, if the appeal is against part of the decision only, to state that part of the decision with which he is dissatisfied. After filing the appeal, the appellant has to file the record of appeal and the appellant`s case and serve a copy each on the respondent within certain times under O 55D r 6, and the respondent in turn has to file the respondent`s case and serve a copy thereof on the appellant within a certain time under r 7. In respect of such appeal, it is only at the stage of filing the appellant`s case that the appellant is required to set out (i) his grounds for impugning the decision or the part thereof under appeal, and (ii) the order he seeks in the appeal. Similarly, the respondent is only required to set out his arguments resisting the appeal only at the stage when he files the respondent`s case.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in the case of an appeal from the decision of a district judge in chambers, such as the appeal filed by Madam Leong, such appeal lies to a judge of the High Court in chambers, and the procedure for such appeal is governed by O 55C, and is quite different from that prescribed by O 55D. First, the appellant is not required to state in the notice of appeal whether he is appealing against the whole or part of the judgment he complains of. In other words, it does not have the equivalent of O 55D r 3(2) (briefly set out above). The rules prescribing the form of notice of appeal and the time for issue thereof are rr 1(3) and (4), which are as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(3) The appeal shall be brought by serving on every other party to the proceedings, in which the judgment, order or decision was given or made, a notice in Form 114F to attend before the Judge of the High Court in Chambers on a day specified in the notice.  </p>\n        <p>(4) Unless the Court otherwise orders, the notice must be issued within 14 days after the judgment, order or decision appealed against was given or made and served on all other parties within 7 days of it being issued.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The form of notice of appeal, Form 114F, is also different from Form 114A. Unlike Form 114A, Form 114F does not require an appellant to state whether the whole or part, and what part of the judgment or order, is under appeal. On the other hand, Form 114F requires the appellant to state in full the order appealed against and further to state the order or orders the appellant seeks in the appeal. Neither the appellant nor the respondent is required to file any case in support of or in resisting the appeal. In effect, the procedure prescribed by O 55C is an accelerated process of appeal from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court.<br/><br/>The appeal filed by or on behalf of Madam Leong was one pursuant to O 55C, ie an appeal from the judgment or order of the district judge <strong><i> in chambers </i></strong> to a judge of the High Court <strong><i> in chambers </i></strong>. In her notice of appeal as originally filed, Madam Leong sought, in so far as relevant here, only an order increasing her share of (i) the stock options that had vested in Mr Chan and had been exercised by him, and (ii) an order giving her a share in the stock options that had not vested in him. No order, however, was sought for a share of the stock options that had vested in Mr Chan but had not been exercised by him. By the application made before the court below, Madam Leong sought the following amendments to be made to the notice of appeal:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>3 There be a division of Dell stocks in the Non-Statutory Stocks Option agreements which <strong><i> have vested but yet to be exercised by the Respondent and which </i></strong> have yet to be vested in the Respondent.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The highlighted portion was the amendment sought by Madam Leong.<br/><br/>There was no direct authority pertaining to the issue in the present appeal, namely, under what conditions an appellant may be allowed to amend a notice of appeal with a view to seeking a new order in the appeal. The closest case is  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Huang Han Chao v Leong Fook Meng &amp; Anor</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1991::286:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1991::286:\">  [1991] SLR 286 </a><a href=\"MLJ:1991:3:337:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1991:3:337:\">  [1991] 3 MLJ 337 </a>, which was heard by this court prior to the amendments to the Rules of Court removing the requirement that the appellant file a petition of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal. There, the appellant amended his petition of appeal to include a new point which was not pleaded or canvassed below. This court refused to hear the appellant on that point, because it was not in the pleadings upon which the case had been argued and decided below. The decision, however, did not address what considerations should be taken into account when considering an application to amend a petition of appeal. In fact, leave to amend the petition of appeal was granted primarily because the appellant, having discharged his original solicitors, had drafted and filed the petition himself in an unsuitable form, and his newly appointed solicitors had to put it right by amending the form, and the amendments made included the point that was not raised below.<br/><br/>In the instant case, the judge below treated the application to amend the notice of appeal substantially as an application for an extension of time to file an appeal. He held that Madam Leong was seeking to appeal, out of time, against that part of the order of the district judge concerning the stock options, and that Madam Leong had not satisfied the requirements in order for the court to exercise its discretion to allow the amendments. He said at [para ] 15-17:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>15 ... I am of the view that the appellant must satisfy not only the rules for amendments, she must also satisfy the rules for extending time to file notices of appeal out of time.  </p>\n        <p>16 The law governing applications to extend time for filing notices of appeal was set out by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hau Khee Wee &amp; Anor v Chua Kian Tong &amp; Anor</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1986::484:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1986::484:\">  [1986] SLR 484 </a> at p 488 when he said:  </p>\n        <p>`The factors to be taken into account in deciding whether to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal are:  </p>\n        <p>(1) the length of the delay;  </p>\n        <p>(2) the reasons for the delay;  </p>\n        <p>(3) the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for appealing is extended; and  </p>\n        <p>(4) the degree of prejudice to the would be respondent if the application is granted.`  </p>\n        <p>17 These factors were referred to and approved by the Court of Appeal in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1991::212:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1991::212:\">  [1991] SLR 212 </a> where Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated `(i)n particular, the chances of the appeal succeeding should be considered, as it would be a waste of time for all concerned if time is extended when the appeal is utterly hopeless`.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The judge next turned to consider the four factors, namely: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the chances of the appeal succeeding if the extension was granted; and (4) the degree of prejudice to the respondent if the application was granted. On the question of delay, the judge held that there was a delay of more than three months after the deadline for filing the notice of appeal. As for the reason for the delay, the reason offered by Madam Leong that the grounds of decision were not released until 11 April 2000 bore little merit, as it was very clear from the district judge`s orders that there was no division in respect of the options that had vested in Mr Chan but had not been exercised by him. As for the prospect of success, the judge held that there was little chance of the appeal succeeding, because the `basis of the claim` appeared to be flawed. Of this, more will be said in a moment. The issue as to prejudice was not addressed by the judge, as apparently neither party argued that issue before him.<br/><br/>In our opinion, the stringent standards required in an application for extension of time to file an appeal are not absolute and applicable to all cases where an extension of time is sought. In this regard, we respectfully adopt the words of Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Costellow v Somerset County Council</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1993] 1 All ER 952</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1993] 1 WLR 256</font>, and say that the resolution of problems such as the present application for leave to amend a notice of appeal cannot be governed by a single universally applicable rule of thumb. A rigid, mechanistic approach is inappropriate.<br/><br/>In at least two other situations, this court has not applied the stringent standards. First, in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Tokai Maru</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1998:3:105:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1998:3:105:\">  [1998] 3 SLR 105 </a>, this court allowed an extension of time to a party to file the affidavit of evidence in chief. Tan Lee Meng J, delivering the judgment of the court, said at [para ] 20:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It would therefore appear that the court adopts a more stringent approach with respect to applications to appeal out of time as compared to other applications to extend time. The instant case does not involve an application to appeal out of time. It concerns an application by the appellant to file an affidavit out of time, coupled with an application by the respondents to strike out the appellants` defence. As such, the approach taken in Ratnam v Cumarasamy should not have been adopted.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Later, he said at [para ] 23:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We note that the instant case involves an application to extend time coupled with an application to strike out the defence ... we are of the view that similar principles should apply in both cases, and these principles are as follows:</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(a) ...  </p>\n        <p>(b) The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and litigants towards the just resolution of the case and should of course be adhered to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not be deprived of his opportunity to dispute the plaintiff`s claims and have a determination of the issues on the merits as a punishment for a breach of these rules unless the other party has been made to suffer prejudice which cannot be compensated for by an appropriate order as to costs.  </p>\n        <p>(c) Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances, it can rarely be appropriate then, on an overall assessment of what justice requires, to deny a defendant an extension of time where the denial would have the effect of depriving him of his defence because of a procedural default which, even if unjustified, has caused the plaintiff no prejudice for which he cannot be compensated by an award of costs.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Secondly, in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Lim Hwee Meng v Citadel Investment Pte Ltd</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1998:3:601:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1998:3:601:\">  [1998] 3 SLR 601 </a>, the respondents filed and served their case out of time and applied for leave to be heard at the hearing of the appeal. The respondent did not give any reason for the delay in filing the case apart from saying that the belated filing was due to an administrative oversight. The appellant objected to the application, and against the objection this court granted leave to the respondent to be heard. Lai Kew Chai J, delivering the judgement of the court, said at [para ] 20:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Counsel for the appellant submitted that the respondents` application should be refused as the respondents had not offered any satisfactory explanation for the delay. Counsel for the appellant sought to rely on the following cases:  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ratnam v Cumarasamy &amp; Anor</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1965:1:228:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1965:1:228:\">  [1965] 1 MLJ 228 </a>,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Tan Chai Heng v Yeo Seng Choon</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1981:1:271:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1981:1:271:\">  [1981] 1 MLJ 271 </a> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1991:3:208:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1991:3:208:\">  [1991] 3 MLJ 208 </a>. We do not intend to deal with these cases in detail. Suffice it to say that these cases concern applications by the appellants to file either the record of appeal or the notice of appeal out of time, and that the upshot of these cases is that the court will not grant an extension of time to the appellant unless the appellant provides a satisfactory explanation for the delay; in the words of Lord Guest in <strong> Ratnam</strong>, there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its discretion. The principles enunciated in these cases are, however, restricted to applications by <strong> an appellant</strong> to extend time and have no relevance to the instant case which concerns an application by <strong> the respondents</strong> to be heard despite having filed their case out of time. The court has always adopted a more stringent approach with respect to applications to appeal out of time as compared to other applications to extend time:  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>The Tokai Maru</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1998:3:105:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1998:3:105:\">  [1998] 3 SLR 105 </a>.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The judge then referred to the decision of Sir John Donaldson MR in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>VCS Ltd v Magmasters Ltd</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1984] 3 All ER 510</font>, where an extension of time to serve the respondent`s notice in an appeal was allowed, and the court held that time was not so important where the notice was merely to add further arguments to an appeal which was already extant. Reverting to the case before him, Lai Kew Chai J said at [para ] 22:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Similarly, a respondent`s application to be heard does not re-open a judgment or order which would otherwise be final. The respondent is merely asking for leave to present, in an existing appeal, arguments which he has, through his own default, lost the right to  present. In that sense, a respondent`s application to be heard does no more than to add further arguments to an appeal which is already extant. The application should therefore be granted unless it can be shown that granting it would cause significant prejudice to the appellant.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>We find most apt the following salutary observations of Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Costellow v Somerset County Council</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1993] 1 All ER 952</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1993] 1 WLR 256</font>:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>As so often happens, this problem arises at the intersection of two principles, each in itself salutary. The first principle is that the rules of court and the associated rules of practice, devised in the public interest to promote the expeditious dispatch of litigation, must be observed. The prescribed time limits are not targets to be aimed at or expressions of pious hope but requirements to be met. This principle is reflected in a series of rules giving the court a discretion to dismiss on failure to comply with a time limit ... This principle is also reflected in the court`s inherent jurisdiction to dismiss for want of prosecution.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The second principle is that a plaintiff should not in the ordinary way be denied an adjudication of his claim on its merits because of procedural default, unless the default causes prejudice to his opponent for which an award of costs cannot compensate. This principle is reflected in the general discretion to extend time conferred by O 3 r 5, a discretion to be exercised in accordance with the requirements of justice in the particular case. It is a principle also reflected in the liberal approach generally adopted in relation to the amendment of pleadings.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Neither of these principles is absolute. If the first principle were rigidly enforced, procedural default would lead to dismissal of actions without any consideration of whether the plaintiff`s default had caused prejudice to the defendant. But the court`s practice has been to treat the existence of such prejudice as a crucial, and often a decisive, matter. If the second principle were followed without exception, a well-to-do plaintiff willing and able to meet orders for costs made against him could flout the rules with impunity, confident that he would suffer no penalty unless or until the defendant could demonstrate prejudice. This would circumscribe the very general discretion conferred by O 3 r 5, and would indeed involve a substantial rewriting of the rule.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The resolution of problems such as the present cannot in my view be governed by a single universally applicable rule of thumb. A rigid, mechanistic approach is inappropriate.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In that case, the plaintiff failed to file and serve his statement of claim in spite of repeated reminders from the defendants. In view of the continuing default, the defendants applied to strike out and dismiss the action for want of prosecution. The district judge made the order sought, and on appeal his decision was affirmed by the judge of the High Court. Before the judge, the plaintiffs applied for leave to file and serve the statement of claim out of time. That application was dismissed. The plaintiff appealed and the Court of Appeal allowed an extension of time to the plaintiff to file his statement of claim and set aside the orders below. The Master of the Rolls said at [1993] 1 All ER 952, 960:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances, it can rarely be appropriate, on an overall assessment of what justice requires, to deny the plaintiff an extension (where the denial will stifle his action) because of a procedural default which, even if unjustifiable, has caused the defendant no prejudice for which he cannot be compensated by an award of costs. In short, an application under O 3 r 5 should ordinarily be granted where the overall justice of the case requires that the action be allowed to proceed.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Turning to the case before us, we did not think that it was appropriate to apply the stringent standards required in an application for extension of time for filing notice of appeal to a situation such as the present one, which is an application to amend a notice of appeal. First, what Madam Leong sought by the amendment had been raised in the affidavit or argument below before the district judge. The appeal to a judge in chambers is by way of rehearing, and probably the arguments to be advanced in the appeal would be substantially the same arguments addressed to the district judge below. Secondly, the appeal procedure in this case is, as we have said, an accelerated process. The appeal had to be initiated by Madam Leong filing a notice of appeal within 14 days from the date of the judgment of the district judge under appeal and the notice had to state, inter alia, the order Madam Leong sought in the appeal. In such appeal, she did not have the luxury of time as she would have in an appeal from the judgment or order of a Subordinate Court to the High Court. Thirdly, the rationale underlying the stringent requirements as to time with respect to an application for an extension of time to file an appeal is that there should be certainty and finality to the decision of a court, and that recourse to the appellate tribunal should not be open-ended. Therefore, a party who is dissatisfied with a decision may appeal but he must do so promptly. Bearing in mind these considerations, a less stringent approach should be adopted in considering an application for leave to amend the notice of appeal.<br/><br/>In the present case, the notice of appeal was filed timeously. The only question was whether leave should be given to amend that notice. It is true that the amendment sought was not inconsequential; it was of a substantive character. Be that as it may, the relevant considerations surely ought to be whether the opposing party had been given reasonable notice of the amendment and afforded a sufficient opportunity to address the substance of the amendment, and whether the amendment sought is consistent with the pleadings or the points raised below. Short of grave prejudice or hardship to the opposing party that cannot be addressed by an order as to costs, the court should lean in favour of allowing the amendment.<br/><br/>It was not disputed there was a delay of about three months in making an application for amendment, and clearly there was an oversight by Madam Leong`s then solicitors in failing to state in the notice of appeal that she sought an order for a division of the stock options that have vested in Mr Chan and have not been exercised by him. This procedural default, on an `overall assessment of what justice requires`, ought not to have precluded Madam Leong from obtaining leave to make the necessary amendment to the notice of appeal to raise a point concerning her entitlement of a share to the stock options that had vested but had not been exercised for determination before the High Court judge hearing the appeal. No prejudice had been occasioned to Mr Chan which could not be compensated by an award of costs.<br/><br/>Turning to the merits of her claim, with respect, we were unable to agree with the judge that there was no merit in Madam Leong`s claim that she was entitled to a share of those stock options. The question really turns on whether such stock options were matrimonial assets falling within s 112 of the Women`s Charter, and if they were, it could well result in a substantial increase in the division of  matrimonial assets in favour of Madam Leong.

Two pillowcases and a bedsheet were found beside the deceased\u2019s head. The bedsheet partly concealed a trail of blood that started at the entrance of the kitchen. A piece of cloth was covering a kitchen window which prevented persons outside the flat from looking in.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Forensic pathologist Dr\u00a0Gilbert Lau conducted a preliminary examination of the deceased at the flat. He found several deep scalp lacerations on both sides of the victim\u2019s head and bruising around her eyes. From this examination, Dr\u00a0Lau placed the time of death as between 8 and 9\u00a0August. Dr\u00a0Lau also conducted an autopsy on the deceased. In the autopsy report, Dr\u00a0Lau described severe and extensive fractures of the skull that he found, and he certified the cause of death to be blunt force trauma to the head. In his opinion, the deceased\u2019s head injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Specimens of blood found in the flat were sent for analysis. None of the specimens were from the appellant. One specimen from the kitchen floor (which was initially thought to be blood, but which analysts were unable to identify as blood or other biological fluids) was found to contain the DNA of her husband Jaganathan Subrayan (\u201cJaganathan\u201d).

He was found unconscious at 11.00am on 8\u00a0August at Yishun Industrial Park A. He was taken to hospital where it was established that he had sustained a severe brain injury. He suffered from post-traumatic amnesia and was, up to the date of the trial, unable to recall the events leading to his injuries.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Jaganathan was charged with the deceased\u2019s murder. The decision to charge him was influenced by the investigation officer\u2019s observation that he was constantly smiling when she interviewed him, and his reply that the deceased\u2019s jewellery was at the \u201carmoury\u201d (in fact he had meant \u201c<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">almari</i>\u201d which is \u201ccupboard\u201d in Malay and Tamil).

His arrest followed the recovery by the police of some of the deceased\u2019s jewellery from Ban Hin Pawnshop Pte Ltd (\u201cBan Hin Pawnshop\u201d) in Yishun Central. The jewellery, which consisted of two chains and nine pendants, had been pawned by the accused for $1,100 at about 9.42am on 7\u00a0August 2002. Amongst the jewellery was the deceased\u2019s <i>thali</i>, an ornament customarily put on an Indian bride by her husband to signify their marriage, which is not removed during the duration of the marriage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The appellant and the deceased had been co-workers at Systematic Laundry Enterprise Pte Ltd. He had been to her flat and had got to know Jaganathan. He described his activities on 7\u00a0August in statements that he made to the police after his arrest. The prosecution relied on 14 statements made by him, which were admitted in evidence without objection by the accused or any complaint from him that they were made involuntarily through inducement, threat, promise or oppression.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He recounted that at the end of July he asked for a loan of $3,000 from the deceased. The deceased told him that she would discuss the matter with her husband and call him back. On 6\u00a0August, she told him to go to her house on 7\u00a0August before she left for work at 7.00am to collect the money.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In his cautioned statement recorded on the day he was arrested, the appellant stated that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I Mohd Raffiq Bin Mohd Aslam wish to state that I have no intention whatsoever to hurt anyone. I was under tremendous pressure to sell [<i>sic</i>] my debts and also my marriage problem. I only need money and whatever I did as I say was not my intention. After doing what I did and found out that murder has taken place I was shock [<i>sic</i>] and scared. I know deceased personally and because of anger at her character I just wanted to hit her, after she started nagging at me. As I say [<i>sic</i>] earlier intention was just to get money and nothing else. It\u2019s hard to believe what I have done even until today.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Later on on the same day, he wrote out another statement that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I, Mohd Raffiq Bin Mohd Aslam I/C 1467938/C of Blk 854 \u2026 Woodlands St 83 know deceased Saratha [the deceased] since I was working in Systematic Laundromat. She was close to everybody and she like to loan out money and she did loan me a couple of hundred dollars. I know her husband casually and we met a couple of times. On that particular day on 7th August at 7.30 she call me to say that money is ready and come and collect. I told her I can only come earlier at 6+ as I have to go work. My intention going there was firstly to ask her why she spread gossip of me and my wife in work place as only she knows about this matter and at same time collect money. When I reach there husband was not around and she invite me to go in and tell me that she don\u2019t have full [amount] of 3k which I ask as her husband took part of it and will be back in the evening. I need the money urgently to settle my debts which I promised. At that same time nothing happen but she started talking of my personal affairs and that\u2019s when I hit her on her head which I really recall is 2\u20133 times. When I saw her on the floor I was scared and really don\u2019t know what to do. I took the money and search the drawer. Then she started telling me that she has no cash to give me. I was disappointed angry and panicked as I had debt to settle. I ransacked her drawer and took cash [amount] of $1060\u2013$1070. At the same time the chain I pawn for $1k and sold the paper as I was scared. After the incident close the [house] door and left. I did promise to bring her husband out for dinner and on that particular day I waited for him down the block and I brought him to dinner. During the dinner conversation he talk about not having money and wife control all the money.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In the next investigation statement also recorded on the same day, the recording officer sought and obtained clarification from him:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt 1in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Q1<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> You have indicated that you hit the deceased\u2019s head 2 to 3 times inside the house.

I had a metal bar in my car and I brought it along to her house. At first, I left the metal bar outside her house and she also saw it. At that point when she told me that she did not have the money and part of it was with the husband, I took the metal bar placed outside her house and used it to hit her head. My intention was to take her money to settle my debts. When she started to shout, I panicked and I hit her on the head. After hitting her, and she was lying on the floor, I dragged her body to one side. That time, she was still alive. I also covered her blood with mattress pad and took a piece of cloth to cover the kitchen window.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt 1in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Q2<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Where is the metal bar which you used to hit the deceased?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-List\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt 1in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A2<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> I threw it away at Yishun Industrial Park A.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> On 2\u00a0September the appellant gave a more detailed account of the assault on the deceased and the events that followed:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">When Saratha was walking towards the main door and the left side of her body was facing me, I took the metal bar from the sofa and held one end of it with both my hands. When she turned her head to look at me, I used the metal bar and hit her on the left side of the head. I did not raise the metal bar above my head level. I just raised it near to my head and then swung it at her head. After the blow hit her, she shouted my name \u201cRaffiq\u201d and covered the left side of her head with one of her hands. She crouched slightly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Before she dropped onto the floor, I hit her head with the metal bar again with both my hands holding one end of the bar. This time, I was standing behind her. I raised the metal bar higher, over my head level and swung it at her head. I cannot remember which part of the head I hit her. She dropped flat onto the floor. The front part of her body was touching the floor and her face facing sidewards, in the direction of the sofa.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After that, I raised the metal bar again and hit her on the left side of the head. I was still standing behind her and holding one side of the metal bar with both my hands. I did not have to raise the metal bar over my head level. I just raised the metal bar higher, near to my head and swung it at the left side of her head. So far as I remember, I hit Saratha 3 times, cannot be more than that.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">At this point, I realised that [there] was a lot of blood on the floor, near her face. She was also making some noise and moving her body slightly. The noise was very soft, like mumbling sound and I could not catch up with what she was saying.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I stood next to her body. I was near to the sofa. I bent my body down to look at where the blood was coming out from. I was not sure whether the blood was coming out from her head or her mouth but there was a lot of blood surrounding her face.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I panicked. I was scared at the sight of so much blood. I did not do anything to help her or stop the bleeding. But seriously, at that time, I did not think that my action would kill her. My thinking was to cause her hurt, take the money and leave the place.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I left the metal bar on the sofa near to her body. After that, I closed the gate and the main door and took a piece of cloth from the cupboard in the master bedroom to cover up the kitchen windows, which were already all closed up. It was a very natural instinct. I did not want anyone to see me in the house, in that condition.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After that, I searched through all the rooms. It was in her handbag in the master bedroom that I saw a black purse, which contained her IC and a Transit Link card. In the end, I only found $10/- notes amounting to $60/- to $70/- in 2 drawers in the master bedroom and a $1,000/- note in a drawer in the spare room. I did not manage to find other cash or valuables. I did not ransack the rooms. I do not know why I did not do so. Seriously, I was only looking for the amount that she agreed to lend me.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After finding the cash, I came out to the living hall. I dragged Saratha away from the pool of blood surrounding her face. She was having difficulty breathing and by putting her away from the blood, I thought it would help her to breathe better. She was still alive and I could hear some soft noise coming out from her noise [<i>sic</i>]. Her body was motionless. I did not do anything else to help her stop the bleeding.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After that, I took one piece of mattress pad and 2 pillow case covers to cover up the pool of blood because I was scared at the sight of so much blood. It was not because I was worried that people could see the blood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After shifting Saratha\u2019s body to the side of the wall, behind the sofa, I took 2 gold chains with pendants from her neck because I have not found enough cash from the rooms. I only found $1,060/- to $1,070/- and I needed at least another $1,000/-. All these money, I intended to pay to the housing agent \u201cPeter\u201d. In a way, I felt pressurised by \u201cPeter\u201d chasing after me for payment. When I removed the gold chains from Saratha\u2019s neck, she was still alive but she did not stop me. I did not notice whether she was still able to move her body.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After that, I found a marketing bag and used it to contain the handbag, which contained the cash and gold chains with pendants. I left the house before 9.00\u00a0am.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The essence of the appellant\u2019s defence was that the incriminating parts of his statements were untrue and that he did not assault the deceased in the way he described in the statements, or in any way.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He confirmed that he had approached the deceased for a loan of $3,000 and that she agreed to give it to him on the morning of 7\u00a0August. When he went to collect it at about 6.20am to 6.25am, he met Jaganathan at the foot of the block where the deceased\u2019s flat was located. Jaganathan handed to him some pieces of jewellery and a $1,000 note and told him that they were from the deceased and that one of her relatives was in the flat and the deceased did not want the relative to know about the loan. Jaganathan also said to him that it was all the cash he and the deceased had at that time, but he would let him have more cash that evening when they met for dinner. (He had promised to give Jaganathan a dinner treat for the latter\u2019s birthday which fell on 5\u00a0August.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> A short while after receiving the jewellery and the money, the appellant telephoned the deceased\u2019s home to thank her. When he asked for the deceased a female voice which he could not recognise said \u201cJaga\u201d, repeating it twice over when he asked for the deceased.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> At about 9.00am, he went to Ban Hin Pawnshop and pawned the jewellery which Jaganathan handed to him earlier for $1,100. With the proceeds, he met a housing agent named Peter to whom he was indebted, and repaid to him $2,100.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In the evening, he drove back to Yishun and picked up Jaganathan after the latter returned home from work. They set off for dinner in his hired car.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> They had dinner at Serangoon, and then proceeded to Geylang for drinks. Along the way, they stopped in the vicinity of Desker Road where Jaganathan engaged the services of a prostitute at the appellant\u2019s expense. After they reached their destination in Geylang, Jaganathan engaged the services of another prostitute, which the appellant also paid for. Then they settled down for drinks. Jaganathan had two or three large bottles of beer, while he had \u201cRed Bull\u201d, and they talked.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Jaganathan told him that his friends would treat him to drinks, but he could not give treats to his friends because the deceased controlled his expenses. He added that he and his wife had had a fight the night before.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> After they had their drinks they went back to the car. Jaganathan, who was intoxicated by then, wanted to go to a temple at Yishun. When they arrived at a temple in Yishun Industrial Park A, Jaganathan wanted to urinate. He stopped his car for Jaganathan to relieve himself by the roadside, and he also got out of the car.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> While they were outside the car, Jaganathan said he had a problem and needed help. He said that he had hit the deceased, and he wanted the appellant to return the deceased\u2019s <i>thali</i>. When he offered the pawn ticket to Jaganathan, that did not placate him. Jaganathan continued to demand for the <i>thali</i> and threatened to tell the police that he (the appellant) had taken the <i>thali</i>. Jaganathan even offered him $1,000 if he admitted to the police that he took the <i>thali</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He was alarmed by what he heard, and pushed Jaganathan who fell on to the grass verge. He then took a metal bar from the boot of the car and hit Jaganathan twice with it. He took away Jaganathan\u2019s wallet and key chain and drove off, leaving Jaganathan there.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He drove around, thinking over the events of the night, and eventually decided to visit the deceased. He arrived at the deceased\u2019s block at around 10.00pm. He made a telephone call to her flat, but no one answered. He then went up to the flat, and gained entry with the keys he took from Jaganathan.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The flat was in darkness. When he switched on a light, he saw a large piece of orange cloth covering the floor and another piece of cloth covering the kitchen window. He saw the deceased lying face down on the floor behind a sofa in the living room. He was shocked and scared. He called her name a few times, then switched off the light and left. He estimated that he was in the flat for about five minutes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He threw away Jaganathan\u2019s keys, and drove off. He realised that Jaganathan had hurt the deceased and he was not sure if she was dead or alive. He was in a state of panic because Jaganathan could accuse him of injuring the deceased as he had pawned her <i>thali.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Subsequently, he came to know of the deceased\u2019s death and Jaganathan\u2019s arrest from the newspapers. He thought about his own condition. His wife was threatening to divorce him, he was in serious financial difficulties with creditors pressing him, and he was remorseful for hurting Jaganathan. He was also very unhappy, but there was a solution to his problems. He felt that he would get relief if he was to go to prison, as no one would be able to harass or harm him there. Thus, he made those incriminating statements to the police.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> His defence was that those voluntary statements were untrue. They were lies told by him out of his disillusionment with life and remorse for hurting Jaganathan. Since making those statements, his outlook on life and his relationship with his wife had improved, and he had decided to retract the lies and tell the world what really happened.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In the grounds of decision, the trial judge dealt with the legal effect of the retraction of a confession. He referred to <i>Ismail bin U K Abdul Rahman v PP</i> [1972\u20131974] SLR\u00a0232 where the Court of Criminal Appeal affirmed the proposition that an accused person can be convicted on his own confession, even when it is retracted, if the court is satisfied of its truth: see [1] <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">supra</i>, at [72].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The trial judge then went on to state at [73]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I reviewed his testimony with great care. In the end, I came to conclude that what he said in his voluntary statements that he was indeed the person who inflicted injuries on the victim on the morning of 7\u00a0August 2002 was true and that his current protestations were all borne out of an attempt on his part to escape the rigours of the law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In the appeal, counsel submitted that the trial judge had erred in rejecting the appellant\u2019s defence. Five points were raised. The first was that if the appellant had murdered the deceased, he would not have pawned the jewellery in his own name. That presupposed that the appellant knew that the jewellery would be traced. The police were informed by the deceased\u2019s relatives of her missing jewellery. A check was made with the Singapore Pawnshops Association against Jaganathan\u2019s name, and that was negative. Then a search was made against the appellant\u2019s name, which was obtained from the deceased\u2019s co-workers, and it showed that he had pawned the jewellery at Ban Hin Pawnshop on 7\u00a0August. There was nothing to suggest that the appellant knew that his name would come up in the course of investigations, or that a check would be made with the pawnshops.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The second point was that Jaganathan must have removed the <i>thali</i> to reflect the end of the marital bonds with the deceased after he attacked her. The fact was that the <i>thali</i> was not the only item taken, as other items were recovered from the pawnshop. Furthermore, if Jaganathan had attacked his wife and left her for dead, he was not likely to remove the <i>thali</i> and draw attention to himself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The third point was that the police had initially charged Jaganathan for the murder. This was a curious point. We knew that the charge was withdrawn and that the Prosecution had no intention of reviving it. When the prosecuting authority charges a person, that cannot be taken as evidence of his guilt. Any inference of guilt can only be drawn from evidence adduced at his trial, and not the fact that he was charged. <i>A fortiori</i>, the fact that the charge against Jaganathan was withdrawn cannot be a basis for inferring that he may be the real culprit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The fourth point was that the trial judge had not given proper weight to the fact that Jaganathan\u2019s DNA was found in the stain on the kitchen floor. The judge was of the view that little could be made of the fact that a stain of blood or other bodily fluid of Jaganathan was found in his own house. We were of the same view.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The fifth point was that the appellant had explained that he made the false confessions because he was sick and tired of living, and felt pity for Jaganathan. However he did not confess when he learnt that the deceased had died and that Jaganathan had been arrested.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0</span> His confessions did not come until after he was arrested and charged with murdering the deceased. We found that the trial judge was right to reject the explanation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Having considered all the matters raised, we came to the conclusion that the trial judge was well justified in convicting the appellant on the basis of his confessions and the other evidence before the court.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We heard the appeal on 2 March 2001 and dismissed it and now give our reasons.<br/><br/><strong><i> The facts </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The appellant, female, 36 years old, is a drug addict and was previously an inmate of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre. She is divorced with three children, but the children are in the custody of her ex-husband.<br/><br/>On 22 March 2000, at 4.20pm she was arrested by Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) officers in room 507, Brendma East Park Hotel, Kitchener Road. With her in the room was a male friend, one Lai Gek Siew (`Lai`), 41 years old, unemployed, who is also a drug addict. Both had been staying at the hotel from 14 March 2000 until their arrest. The staff of the hotel told the court that they would only allow a Singaporean to register for a room if he or she produced his/her identity card. The room was registered in the name of Lai because the appellant did not have her identity card, having lost it more than a year ago.<br/><br/>Heroin in packets was found in the room. Three straws of heroin were on a chair. Three packets wrapped in newsprint and four straws were in a drawer of a dressing table. A black drawstring bag, with a total of 45 packets of heroin, was found hidden in the false ceiling above the bathroom. The drawstring bag was not sealed or locked. Inside the black drawstring bag were three plastic bags: a red, a blue and a black. In the red plastic bag were 20 packets of substance. In the blue plastic bag were two newsprint wrappings, each containing five packets of substance. In the black plastic bag there were three newsprint wrappers, each containing five packets of substance. The charge preferred against the appellant related only to the drugs found in the drawstring bag. The 45 packets had a net weight of 24.12g of diamorphine.<br/><br/>At the time, scissors, pincers (tweezers), paper foil, some 109 empty plastic sachets, a digital weighing scale and lighters were also found in the room. Evidence was adduced which showed that the appellant had purchased a digital weighing scale a few days before her arrest. The receipt for the purchase was found in her wallet. But no heroin stains were found on the weighing scale.<br/><br/>In the appellant`s statement recorded on 23 March 2000, under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), she said:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>I did not intend to sell the drugs. A male Malaysian asked me to keep the drugs for him. My friend Lai Gek Siew has nothing to do with the drugs.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In her second statement recorded on 29 March 2000, she admitted to the ownership of the drugs, stating that the 45 packets found in the black drawstring bag were given to her by one Hak Chai for safe-keeping and in return Hak Chai would forgo the $1,000 debt she owed him. In her third statement recorded on 5 April 2000, she gave an account of her dealings with Hak Chai. She also exonerated Lai from any knowledge of the drawstring bag. In her words, `I did not tell (Lai) about the black bag.`<br/><br/>However, there is an aspect of the evidnece which should be mentioned at this juncture. A fingerprint expert, ASP Lay Yeow Khoon, told the court that Lai`s fingerprints were found on the magazine paper used to wrap some of the drugs. Lai explained that he had been reading some of the magazines taken from the hotel  front desk. The pages came from the 11-17 March 2000 issue of Singapore This Week, a tourist promotional magazine freely distributed at the hotel reception. The appellant did not make any comment regarding this aspect of Lai`s evidence. Lai also said that the heroin in the room belonged to the appellant, except as regards those in the drawstring bag found in the false ceiling, which he did not know existed. Neither did he know how the drawstring bag happened to be there. Lai was eventually not charged for drug-trafficking though he was arrested together with the appellant. Instead, he testified for the prosecution.<br/><br/>In the light of the foregoing evidence, the trial judge called upon the appellant to enter her defence. The appellant`s evidence was that on 12 March 2000, she received five packets of heroin from Hak Chai, a drug peddler, who had taken over from a previous peddler, `Ah Tee`. Those five packets of heroin were for her own consumption. They cost $1,000 and were not paid for. In return for waiving the debt, Hak Chai wanted the appellant to safe-keep something for him. So on 19 March 2000, Hak Chai asked the appellant to go to a rubbish bin near the Toa Payoh Post Office to pick up a plastic bag. She collected the plastic bag at around 8pm and returned to the hotel. She then called Hak Chai and was asked by the latter to help him keep it. She was informed that its contents were of a value of $9,000. He also informed the appellant that he would call her again later with regard to the return of the drawstring bag.<br/><br/>On opening the plastic bag, the appellant saw a black drawstring bag and a paper wrapper. Inside the paper wrapper, there were three packets of heroin. She took the three packets as they were meant for her personal consumption. She did not open the drawstring bag. She then hid the drawstring bag, with the substance therein, above the false ceiling of the bathroom. She did not touch it again. The next time she saw the drawstring bag was on the day of her arrest, when the CNB officers retrieved it from the false ceiling.<br/><br/>The appellant admitted that the three straws of heroin found on the chair and the three packets and four straws of heroin found in the drawer were hers, but they were for her own consumption. She also stated that it was Hak Chai who had asked her to buy the digital weighing scale and the empty plastic sachets, although she did not know what purposes they were meant for.<br/><br/>It would be noted that the only inconsistency in her oral evidence, compared with the statements she gave earlier, was her denial of being the owner of the heroin, or that she suspected the black drawstring bag contained heroin. She admitted that Hak Chai had placed three packets of heroin in the plastic bag (together with the black drawstring bag), for her personal consumption. The trial judge drew the obvious inference that the 45 packets of heroin found in the black drawstring bag were not meant for the appellant`s own consumption but was for trafficking. He also held that the appellant would be guilty of trafficking even if the drug in the drawstring bag were meant to be returned to Hak Chai later.<br/><br/><strong><i> Motion to adduce additional evidence </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before we proceed to examine the grounds raised by the appellant at the appeal, we ought to refer to a motion filed by the appellant to adduce additional evidence for this court`s consideration of the appeal.<br/><br/>In her affidavit filed in support of the motion, the appellant alleged that it was Lai who had bought the digital weighing scale and had also brought the black drawstring bag into the hotel room, without telling her about them. Furthermore, at the time the CNB officers raided the room, Lai had asked her to shoulder the blame and responsibility for the drugs found in the room. He repeated this request on two occasions later. She said that she did as was told by Lai because Lai had assured her that she would only serve a short sentence of between eight to ten years and he had also promised her that he would marry her after her imprisonment and would, while she was serving her imprisonment, look after her mother. As she loved him very much, she agreed to the suggestion. Furthermore, when she accepted blame, on behalf of Lai, she did not know that the black drawstring bag contained drugs. The appellant claimed that, for all these reasons, she concocted a story that she had collected the black drawstring bag from Hak Chai.<br/><br/>The appellant thus wanted to adduce the following additional evidence. First, that Lai asked her to purchase the digital weighing scale. Secondly, that on 21 March 2000, Lai told her that a friend had left the black drawstring bag with him and told her not to ask so many questions about it. Lai then took the black drawstring bag to the bathroom and returned to the room without it. It was Lai who placed it above the false ceiling. Thirdly, Lai had, on several occasions, asked her to shoulder the blame for the drugs. She agreed to do so, because she loved him and thought that her own family (her three children) did not care for her.<br/><br/>Explaining why she decided to tell the true version of the events at this eleventh hour, she said that after the conviction at the High Court, her three children had visited her and showed much love and concern for her. She was moved. On the other hand, Lai had not kept his promise to take care of her mother. She realised she should live for the children and not die for Lai.<br/><br/>It is clear that this court, on hearing an appeal, has the power to admit additional evidence. This is provided for in s 55 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Ed) (`SCJA`), which reads as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(1) In dealing with any appeal, the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court.  </p>\n        <p>(2) When such additional evidence is taken by the trial court, it shall certify such evidence, with a statement of its opinion on the case considered with regard to the additional evidence, to the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal shall thereupon proceed to dispose of the appeal.  </p>\n        <p>(3) The parties to the appeal shall be present when such additional evidence is taken.  </p>\n        <p>(4) In dealing with any appeal, the Court of Appeal may also, if it thinks fit, call for and receive from the trial court a report of any matter connected with the trial.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The conditions to be fulfilled before the court exercises the power to admit additional evidence were enunciated by Lord Denning in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ladd v Marshall</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1954] 3 All ER 745</font>. In that case, the court laid down three conditions and they relate to non-availability of the fresh evidence, the relevance of the new evidence and the credibility of that evidence. This test involving the application of the three conditions was adopted and applied by this court in numerous cases, eg  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Rajendra Prasad v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"MLJ:1991:2:1:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1991:2:1:\">  [1991] 2 MLJ 1 </a> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Van Damme Johannes v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1994:1:246:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1994:1:246:\">  [1994] 1 SLR 246 </a>.<br/><br/>On the facts, there could not be any question that the first condition of non-availability was not satisfied. Counsel for the appellant, Ms Goh, had to concede as much. All the additional evidence sought to be adduced was available at the time of the trial and could have been adduced had the appellant been so minded to do. The appellant was also represented by Ms Goh at the trial.<br/><br/>On the second condition, despite Mr Reddy`s submission to the contrary, we thought that the additional evidence was clearly relevant. But, in our opinion, what the additional evidence which the appellant sought to adduce failed to satisfy related to the third condition on credibility.<br/><br/>The appellant said in her affidavit that on the day the CNB officers came into the hotel room, Lai, who was standing behind her, asked her to shoulder the blame for the drugs. If Lai had whispered anything to the appellant, the CNB officers would have noticed. What was more incredible was the assertion that she agreed to assume blame, expecting, as he told her, that it would only be a matter of imprisonment of some eight to ten years. But surely when the charge and consequent punishment were read and explained to her before the trial, the appellant would have known the serious nature of the charge. Ms Goh was already her counsel. She could not have failed to appreciate that the charge she faced carried the death penalty, and yet she went through the trial asserting that Lai had nothing to do with the drugs.<br/><br/>We would hasten to add that we recognised that the primary consideration of s 55(1) of the SCJA, in allowing fresh evidence, is the interest of justice. But it does not follow that each time a convicted accused changes his mind, justice would require that he be given an opportunity to adduce further evidence. The court has to assess each situation as it arises. In this regard, we had borne in mind what Lord Taylor CJ said in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Ahluwalia</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1992] 4 All ER 889</font>:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>Ordinarily, of course, any available defences should be advanced at trial ... It cannot be too strongly emphasised that this court would require much persuasion to allow such a defence to be raised for the first time here if the option had been exercised at the trial not to pursue it. Otherwise, as must be clear, defendants might be encouraged to run one defence at trial in the belief that if it fails, this court would allow a different defence to be raised and give the defendant, in effect, two opportunities to run different defences. Nothing could be further from the truth.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>...</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>We emphasise that the circumstances we have described and which have led us to this conclusion are wholly exceptional.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>R v Stafford</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1968] 3 All ER 752</font>, Edmund Davies LJ also sounded a similar note of caution of the possible mischief if the court should regularly  receive fresh evidence when there was no adequate explanation for the failure to adduce it at trial:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>public mischief would ensue and legal process could become indefinitely prolonged were it the case that evidence produced at any time will generally be admitted by this court when verdicts are being reviewed.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>While recognising the overriding consideration of justice, Yong Pung How CJ in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Juma`at bin Samad v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1993:3:338:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1993:3:338:\">  [1993] 3 SLR 338 </a> at 347G put the whole matter in perspective as follows:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>It is true that there are situations where the court would allow additional evidence to be called even though it could not be strictly said that the evidence was not available at the time of the trial, if it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. The core principle in s 257 of the CPC [pari materia with s 55(1) of the SCJA] after all, is that additional evidence may be taken if it is necessary, which must mean necessary in the interests of justice. That said, it must be emphasised in no uncertain terms that such a situation will arise only in the most extraordinary circumstances.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>Reverting to the present case, we did not see any extraordinary circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretion in admitting the additional evidence. The appellant ran a line of defence at the trial. That was rejected. Now at the appeal stage she took a defence which was completely at variance with the defence taken at the trial. There was nothing to suggest that what she now sought to say at this late stage was likely to be more credible than what she said at the trial. Furthermore, even if we believed what she alleged in the motion to be true, that the drugs were, in fact, brought back by Lai, and belonged to Lai, the evidence (including her evidence that she bought the weighing scale on behalf of Lai) suggested quite clearly that she was very much involved in Lai`s drug activities. She was not an innocent bystander. She abetted in what he did.<br/><br/><strong><i> The question of possession </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The main contention of the appellant at the trial was that she did not know there were drugs in the drawstring bag. Contrary to the statements she gave, she denied having admitted that she was the owner of the drugs in that bag.<br/><br/>Before us, counsel for the appellant submitted that the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had possession of the drawstring bag and its contents. It was pointed out that whenever the appellant was out of the room, the room key would be left with Lai or the hotel reception counter. The appellant and Lai seldom went out of the hotel room together. There were occasions when the appellant went out, and Lai was still in the room, and she would leave the room key with Lai. If, however, at the time, Lai had already gone out, the appellant would leave the room key with the hotel reception. On her return, when she approached the hotel reception counter for the room key, the receptionist would give the key to her without asking for identification. Furthermore, when she was out of the room, she would not know if Lai had brought anyone else into the room. The thrust of all these contentions was to show that between 19 March and 22 March 2000, the contents of the drawstring bag could have been tampered with by a third party.<br/><br/>Another argument of the appellant was that she did not know what was in the drawstring bag or that they were drugs. She did not check the contents of the bag as she had no reason to and had no permission from Hak Chai to do so.<br/><br/><strong><i> Our determination </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The evidence did not bear out the assertion of the appellant that the drawstring bag placed above the bathroom ceiling could have been tampered with by a third party. There was no evidence that Lai had allowed any third party to enter the hotel room. Lai was not even asked about this when he was in the witness box. Neither could the appellant say that there were any occasion on which Lai had brought anyone to the room. In this connection, we must point out that according to the appellant, Lai had no knowledge of the drawstring bag. Neither was there any evidence that a stranger could have entered the hotel room using the room key because the hotel reception counter staff did not ask for identification before handing over the room key. The defence did not cross-examine the hotel management staff along this line. It could very well be that the reception counter staff recognised who the appellant was and thus did not ask for identification before handing the room key over to her.<br/><br/>This entire assertion was highly speculative and conjectural. The fact of the matter was that the drawstring bag was hidden by the appellant above the false ceiling of the bathroom. It was not within view. Her intention was obviously to prevent anyone from seeing it or discovering it by chance.<br/><br/>The appellant admitted getting the drawstring bag from Hak Chai, her drug peddler. The understanding was that she would safe-keep the drawstring bag and its contents for Hak Chai and in return Hak Chai would not demand the payment of the $1,000 debt, which the appellant owed Hak Chai in respect of a previous supply of heroin. In her cautioned statement recorded on 23 March 2000, she admitted that Lai, though occupying the same room with her, had nothing to do with the drug. She repeated that in a later statement. Therefore, there was ample evidence for the trial judge to have concluded that the appellant had physical possession of the drawstring bag and the contents therein.<br/><br/>Finally, we would refer briefly to the point that the appellant did not have exclusive access to the room. However, that fact does not necessarily suggest that she could not have possession of the drugs: see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Fun Seong Cheng v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1997:3:523:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1997:3:523:\">  [1997] 3 SLR 523 </a> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Chia Song Heng v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1999:4:705:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1999:4:705:\">  [1999] 4 SLR 705 </a>. It would depend on the circumstances of the case. Here, the appellant said she placed the drawstring bag with its contents above the false ceiling of the bathroom. According to her, Lai did not know about the bag. Lai also told the court that he did not know of the existence of the bag until the CNB officers discovered it. There was no evidence that anyone had tampered with the bag or was likely to have tampered with the bag.<br/><br/><strong><i> The appellant`s knowledge of the drug </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It is settled law that to prove possession, apart from mere physical possession, knowledge is required: see eg  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Low Kok Wai v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1994:1:676:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1994:1:676:\">  [1994] 1 SLR 676 </a>,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1996:1:253:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1996:1:253:\">  [1996] 1 SLR 253 </a> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Lim Beng Soon v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:2000:4:589:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:2000:4:589:\">  [2000] 4 SLR 589 </a>.<br/><br/>In the statement recorded on 5 April 2000, the appellant said that although she did not ask Hak Chai about the contents in the drawstring bag, she suspected the stuff inside to be heroin. She also stated that `a male Malaysian asked me to keep the drugs for him`. Upon her return to the hotel room, she opened the plastic bag and saw a black drawstring bag and a newspaper wrapping containing three packets of heroin which were for her own consumption.<br/><br/>By its very nature, in a case of this kind, knowledge is a matter that has to be inferred in the light of all the circumstances. In our judgment, the appellant knew that there were illegal drugs in the bag. First, Hak Chai was a drug peddler and had previously supplied drugs to her. Second, the very secretive and suspicious manner in which Hak Chai chose to pass the drawstring bag to the appellant (leaving it at a public dustbin). Third, there were three packets of heroin in the plastic bag which were meant for the appellant. Fourth, the appellant was told that the stuff in the bag were of a value of $9,000. Fifth, for the favour of safe-keeping the drawstring bag (and the stuff therein), Hak Chai would write off the debt of $1,000 which the appellant owed him. Sixth, she hid the drawstring bag, with its contents, above the false ceiling of the bathroom. All these pointed irresistibly to the fact that the appellant knew the nature of the stuff in the drawstring bag. This was further confirmed by what she said in her statements. It was not just an instance of wilful blindness. She was fully aware of the contents. Thus, we entirely agreed with the trial judge that possession of the drugs by the appellant had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption laid down in s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Ed) (`MDA`) that she was in possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking was accordingly triggered.<br/><br/><strong><i> Future return to owners </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>There is one last point we need to mention in passing. According to the appellant, she was to keep the drawstring bag (with the contents) for Hak Chai, and that Hak Chai would later contact her to tell her how to dispose of the drugs. The fact that the appellant was holding the drugs as a safe-keeper and would be passing them on (either back to Hak Chai or to a third person indicated by Hak Chai) would not render the possession any less that it was for the purpose of trafficking: see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Sze Siew Luan v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1997:2:522:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1997:2:522:\">  [1997] 2 SLR 522 </a>,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>PP v Goh Hock Huat</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1995:1:274:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1995:1:274:\">  [1995] 1 SLR 274 </a> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Lee Yuan Kwang v PP</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1995:2:349:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1995:2:349:\">  [1995] 2 SLR 349 </a>. It must be borne in mind that `traffic` is defined in the MDA to mean, inter alia, `give`, `transport` or `deliver`. Indeed, the fact that the appellant would be delivering the drugs either back to Hak Chai or to a third person reinforces the point that she was in possession for the purpose of trafficking.<br/><br/><strong><i> Judgment </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the reasons given above, possession by the appellant of at least 24.12g (nett) of diamorphine was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption under s 17 of the MDA was triggered. She failed to discharge on a balance of probabilities the burden of rebutting the presumption raised against her. Thus, the conviction recorded against the appellant was not impugned. In the premises, we dismissed the appeal.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n    <p>Motion and appeal dismissed.<br/><br/></p>\n  </body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"filePath\" content=\"\\BLOBS\\7\\8\\URJ_[2001]_SGCA_52_v1.0.html\"/>\n  <style/></head>\n  <CaseReport>\n  <Metadata seqid=\"4172\" id=\"4172-M\" uniqueid=\"ddf7c144-44a4-4825-b79f-51619fafa107\">\n    <Category xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Content.xml#r1c1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Judgments</Category>\n    <Group>Cases</Group>\n    <PublishedInfo>\n      <Uri>/Judgment/4172-M.xml</Uri>\n      <PublishedDate>2003-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</PublishedDate>\n    </PublishedInfo>\n    <IndexCourt>Court of Appeal</IndexCourt>\n    <DecisionDate>2001-08-07T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</DecisionDate>\n    <IndexYear>2001</IndexYear>\n    <NeutralCitation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Court>SGCA</Court>\n      <No>52</No>\n      <NCit>[2001] SGCA 52</NCit>\n    </NeutralCitation>\n    <Citation>\n      <Year>2001</Year>\n      <Series>SGCA</Series>\n      <PageNo>52</PageNo>\n      <Cit>[2001] SGCA 52</Cit>\n    </Citation>\n    <CaseTitle>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Indra Krishnan</CaseTitle><SortTitle>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Indra Krishnan</SortTitle><SortDate>2001-08-07T00:00:00.0000000+08:00</SortDate>\n    <CaseNumber>CA 600011/2001</CaseNumber>\n    <Parties>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Plaintiff</Role>\n        <Name>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#2\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Defendant</Role>\n        <Name>Indra Krishnan</Name>\n      </Party>\n      <Party>\n        <Role xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Roles.xml#7\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third Party</Role>\n      </Party>\n    </Parties>\n    <Jurisdiction xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Jurisdiction.xml#1\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Singapore</Jurisdiction>\n    <Corams>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#68\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Chao Hick Tin JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#539\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L P Thean JA</Coram>\n      <Coram xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"Coram_SG.xml#627\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Yong Pung How CJ</Coram>\n    </Corams>\n    <Counsels>\n      <Counsel>Appellant in person</Counsel>\n      <Counsel>Davinder Singh SC and Hri Kumar (Drew &amp; Napier) for the respondent</Counsel>\n    </Counsels>\n    <CatchWords>\n      <CatchWord order=\"1\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2324\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Insolvency Law</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"2\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2339\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Bankruptcy</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"3\" xlink:type=\"locator\" xlink:href=\"CatchWords.xml#2342\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Bankruptcy order</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"4\">Default by debtor under arrangement reflected in consent order</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"5\">Prior consent by debtor to bankruptcy order being made</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"6\">Whether creditor right to proceed with bankruptcy petition</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"7\">Whether burden on creditor to prove inability of debtor to pay debts</CatchWord>\n      <CatchWord order=\"8\">Whether arrangement extortionate</CatchWord>\n    </CatchWords>\n  \n\n<SLR>YES</SLR></Metadata>\n</CaseReport>\n<body>\n    <p>(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was an appeal against a decision of the High Court upholding an order made by the assistant registrar on 19 January 2001 adjudging the appellant a bankrupt. We heard the appeal on 23 July 2001 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.<br/><br/><strong><i> The facts </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The material facts giving rise to the bankruptcy order were largely undisputed. The respondent and nine other persons successfully sued the appellant (among others) for defamation and were awarded damages. The debts due to two of the judgment creditors, after some legal wrangling, were paid, leaving unpaid the debts due to the other eight creditors, including the respondent. The appellant failed to satisfy the debts due even after statutory demands had been served on him on 31 May 2000. Eventually, on 23 September 2000 the respondent and the other creditors filed bankruptcy petitions against the appellant, and the petitions were fixed to be heard on 3 November 2000. The amount owing by the appellant to the respondent at the date of the petition was $27,721.66.<br/><br/>Before the petitions were due to be heard, the appellant offered to pay the debts due to the eight creditors by instalments. On 3 November 2000 the respondent and the other creditors agreed to accede to the appellant`s request for payment by instalments subject to conditions. The agreement was reached through the appellant`s solicitor, Mr G Raman.<br/><br/>In accordance with this agreement, the parties appeared on that day before the assistant registrar to record what they had agreed in the form of a consent order. At the hearing, the appellant was represented by Mr G Raman. The parties had agreed that the appellant was to pay the respondent a sum of $2,500 on 6 November 2000 (and similar or identical sums to the other creditors) and the remainder by nine monthly instalments, commencing 1 December 2000, the last instalment to be paid on 1 August 2001, and if the appellant should fail to make payment of any instalments on time, the respondent was entitled to terminate the agreement. The parties further agreed as follows (as set out in [para ]2-4 of the consent order):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>2. All payments are to be made by cash or cheque in the debtor`s name (such cheques being made payable to Drew &amp; Napier). All such payments are to be made through the Debtor`s solicitors, G Raman &amp; Partners and to the Creditor`s solicitors, and the letter accompanying such payments to be marked for the attention of Mr Davinder Singh or Mr Hri Kumar. If payment is made by cheque, the cheque must bear a date on or before the due date of payment. Otherwise, it will be treated as a failure to make payment on time.  </p>\n        <p>3. The hearing of the Petition shall be adjourned for 1 week. In the event the Debtor pays the sum of $2,500.00 as provided in Clause 1(i) above, the Creditor`s solicitor shall inform the Court by 8 November 2000, whereupon the Petition will be withdrawn, with liberty to the Creditor to restore the same for hearing on or by 3 August 2001.  </p>\n        <p>4. If the Debtor fails to make any of the payments set out in Clause 1 above, the Creditor shall be entitled, at his absolute discretion, to proceed with and/or restore this Bankruptcy Petition. In that event, the debtor shall consent to a bankruptcy order being made against him.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellant made the initial payment of $2,500 and paid the instalment due on 1 December 2000. However, on 28 December 2000, the appellant`s solicitors wrote to the respondent`s solicitors (and the other creditors` solicitors too) stating that he would not be able to make the instalment payment due on 1 January 2001 and asking for an extension until 16 January 2001 to make it. On 2 January 2001 the respondent`s solicitors replied acceding to the request, but stating very clearly that the extension was up to 12 noon on 16 January 2001 and that, if the appellant should fail to make the payment by the appointed time, the respondent reserved her right to proceed with bankruptcy. They further stated that their extension was granted without prejudice to the respondent`s rights under the terms of the consent order.<br/><br/>No payment was received by the respondent or her solicitors by noon on 16 January 2001. Thereupon by a letter of the same day, faxed at 12.01pm, the respondent`s solicitors wrote to the appellant`s solicitor terminating the agreement and stating that the respondent would proceed with the petition for a bankruptcy order. The respondent`s solicitors also wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court asking the latter to restore the petition (and the petitions of the other seven creditors) for hearing.<br/><br/>At 2.41pm the same day, the appellant`s solicitors faxed a letter to the respondent`s solicitors stating that the appellant would pay the overdue instalment the next morning. The respondent`s solicitor replied also on the same day, rejecting the appellant`s offer to pay, and stating that, in view of the breach, the  respondent had terminated the agreement and was entitled to proceed with the bankruptcy proceedings.<br/><br/>The petition of the respondent (and also those of the other seven creditors) came up for hearing on 19 January 2001. The balance owing to all the petitioners as of that day was $175,313. After hearing counsel for the appellant and the respondent, the assistant registrar adjudged the appellant a bankrupt. In order to save costs, the other seven petitions were adjourned pending the present appeal.<br/><br/>The appellant`s appeal against the bankruptcy order was dismissed by the judge-in-chambers. The judge agreed with the assistant registrar that, upon the appellant`s failure to make the third payment on time, the respondent was entitled to terminate the agreement under which the respondent allowed the appellant to pay the debt by instalments and to demand that the appellant pay up all the outstanding debt. He noted that the main question which the court must decide in a bankruptcy petition hearing was to determine whether or not the debtor was able to pay his debt and, as he found like the assistant registrar, that the appellant was unable to pay up the debt, the assistant registrar was correct to have made the bankruptcy order. There was accordingly no basis for him to overturn the decision of the assistant registrar. We should add that, in coming to his decision to uphold the order made by the assistant registrar, the judge did not rely on the terms of the consent order that the appellant would consent to the making of a bankruptcy order against him.<br/><br/><strong><i> The law </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Under s 61(1) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Ed), a creditor is permitted to present a bankruptcy petition against a debtor only if, inter alia, (i) the debt or aggregate amount of the debts is not less than $10,000; (ii) the debt is for a liquidated sum payable to the petitioning creditor immediately; and (iii) the debtor is unable to pay the debt. Under s 62, a debtor is presumed to be unable to pay the debt if, upon expiry of 21 days after having been served with a statutory demand, he still fails to comply with it. The court may, for sufficient reason, order the stay of a bankruptcy petition, either altogether or for a specified time and on such terms and conditions as it may think just (s 64) and it may make a bankruptcy order only if it is satisfied that the debt has neither been paid nor secured or compounded for (s 65(1)).<br/><br/>Finally, we ought to mention that under s 7, the court is empowered to review, rescind or vary any order made by it under its bankruptcy jurisdiction.<br/><br/><strong><i> Effect of consent order </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In this appeal the appellant raised in essence three issues for the consideration of this court and we shall deal with them in turn. There was a fourth issue but it was very much part of the first issue, which was: did the fact that the appellant agreed with the respondent that he would consent to a bankruptcy order in the event of any default take away the power of the court granted under the Bankruptcy Act? He submitted that the court was not bound by the consent order. For this contention, he relied upon s 7 and submitted that:   </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>The Bankruptcy Act is not just a matter of contract. A petitioning creditor in bankruptcy and the debtor could not agree between themselves that the debtor should give up any right given to him by the Act.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In this regard, he cited in support, inter alia, two cases,  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Hyman v Hyman</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1929]  AC 601</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1929]  All ER Rep 245</font> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Kearley v Thomson</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1890] 24 QBD 742</font>, to argue that in relation to matters of status, the parties cannot contract out of what is provided by the law. He contended that to determine whether he was able or unable to pay the debts, the factual matrix must be considered. The respondent (and the other creditors), by accepting payment by instalments, showed that they `accepted that the appellant would be able to pay his debts given the time asked for`. This ability was demonstrated by the fact that the first two payments were made on time. As for the third payment, he was able to pay in cash on 17 January 2001 before 11am. Furthermore, in terms of availability of funds to the respondent, it would have made no difference because even if the cheque were tendered by noon on 16 January 2001, the funds would not have been available to the respondent any earlier. The cheque would have needed time to be cleared through the banking system.<br/><br/>In our view, it is critically important to bear in mind the substance of what the parties had agreed on 3 November 2000 before they went into the chambers of the assistant registrar to record that understanding as a consent order. It was that the respondent (and the other seven creditors too) was prepared to allow the appellant to pay the debt owing by ten instalments, with the dates of each payment clearly spelt out, and that if the appellant should fail to pay up on time with any of the instalments, the respondent would be able to proceed with the bankruptcy petition for what remained outstanding of the original debt. This would mean that upon such a breach, the agreement for instalment payments would be terminated and all remaining instalments would be due and payable immediately.<br/><br/>The facts showed clearly that the appellant was not able to make the third payment on time. Shortly before the due date, he wrote for an extension. The respondent acceded to that request but specified clearly that the payment must be made by noon on 16 January 2001. In the circumstances, time was of the essence. This deadline the appellant failed to meet. Thus, in accordance with the agreement, the respondent was entitled to terminate the instalment arrangement and demand the payment of all outstanding instalments.<br/><br/>Of course, upon the restoration of the petition, the court must, notwithstanding the appellant`s consent to the making of the bankruptcy order, be satisfied that the appellant was unable to pay all that remained outstanding of the debt. It was clear that the assistant registrar was satisfied; and so was the judge-in-chambers.<br/><br/>We do not dispute what was decided in <strong><i> Hyman v Hyman </i></strong> (supra). There, the court held that a wife could not by agreement in a deed of separation preclude herself from invoking the jurisdiction conferred by statute upon the court to make provision for a wife on the dissolution of marriage as the power was conferred not only in the interests of the wife but also of the public.<br/><br/>In <strong><i> Kearley v Thomson </i></strong> (supra), a contract between a friend of a bankrupt and the solicitor for the petitioning creditor that upon payment of the solicitor`s costs, the defendant would not appear at the public examination of the bankrupt and not oppose his order of discharge (to which course of action the client consented), was held to be illegal. Because of the illegality, a part payment made by the friend of the bankrupt to the solicitor pursuant to the agreement, was held to be irrecoverable.<br/><br/>But we must point out that in both <strong><i> Hyman v Hyman </i></strong> and <strong><i> Kearley v Thomson </i></strong> what were involved were private agreements, not an order of court. An order of court stands unless set aside: see  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Wilding v Sanderson</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1897] 2 Ch 534</font> and  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Chia Sook Lan Maria v Bank of China</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1975-1977::9:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1975-1977::9:\">  [1975-1977] SLR 9 </a><a href=\"MLJ:1976:1:245:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"MLJ:1976:1:245:\">  [1976] 1 MLJ 245 </a>.<br/><br/>At the hearing before the assistant registrar it seemed to us that the assistant registrar did not rely upon that part of the consent order, that the appellant would agree to the making of the bankruptcy order, to come to her decision to adjudge the appellant a bankrupt. She was satisfied that he was unable to pay up all the full outstanding amount. At the hearing before the judge-in-chambers, the judge asked the appellant`s solicitors if the appellant could pay the full outstanding sum and was told that he could not. In the circumstances, there was no basis for the judge to overrule the bankruptcy order made by the assistant registrar. Similarly before us, there was no cogent evidence that the appellant would be able to pay up the full amount of the outstanding debt.<br/><br/>While we recognised that the court had the power conferred under s 7, there was nothing in the circumstances of the present case indicating that the court need invoke that provision. Apart from the question as to the scope of this section, namely, whether it could apply to such a consent order, the fact of the matter was that neither the assistant registrar, nor the judge-in-chambers, had relied upon the appellant`s consent to a bankruptcy order being made, in deciding to make the order. Neither had we in dismissing this appeal. They were satisfied, as we were, that the appellant was not able to pay up in full the outstanding debt to the respondent.<br/><br/><strong><i> Burden of proof of inability to pay </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The second ground raised by the appellant was that the burden rested on the respondent to show that the appellant was unable to pay the debt. And in this case, all that the respondent was able to do was to make a bare assertion that the appellant was so unable.<br/><br/>But in the light of s 62, the appellant was presumed to be unable to pay the debt following his non-compliance with the statutory demand. The burden thus shifted to the appellant to rebut that presumption and to show that he was able to pay the outstanding debt. In this connection, the arguments of the appellant repeated those dealt with under the first issue, namely, that he could make the third payment and that the lateness in making that payment was of no consequence. We do not propose to traverse the ground again.<br/><br/>The appellant relied upon the High Court decision in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Re Boey Hong Khim</strong></font> <a href=\"SLR:1998:3:38:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1998:3:38:\">  [1998] 3 SLR 38 </a>. It is true that there Warren Khoo J emphasised that it was  incumbent on the creditor in a creditor`s petition to support his allegation that the debtor was unable to pay his debts. But the court there also added that to ease the burden of proof on the creditor, s 62 provides that there shall be a presumption of inability where certain objective facts are proven. Khoo J recognised that a common means of proof of inability to pay is a statutory demand served on the debtor. In that case the petitioning creditor was relying on a failure on the part of the debtor to comply with the obligations under a voluntary arrangement and that, in the view of the judge there, was not a sufficient ground to support a bankruptcy petition. The petitioning creditor was not relying on the presumption arising from the non-satisfaction of a statutory demand. In our opinion, the decision in <strong><i> Re Boey Hong Khim </i></strong> was of no assistance to the appellant.<br/><br/><strong><i> Extortion </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We now turn to the third ground: that it was extortionate of the respondent to impose the condition that, should the appellant fail to pay any of the instalments within time, he should consent to a bankruptcy order being made. In this regard, he relied upon the judgment of Evershed MR in  <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Re Majory, a Debtor</strong></font> <font color=\"#330099\">[1955]  Ch 600</font><font color=\"#330099\">[1955] 2 All ER 65</font>:  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(4) On the other hand, having regard to what Jenkins L.J. called \"the potent instrument of oppression\" which bankruptcy proceedings (with their potential consequences upon property and status) provide, the court will always look strictly at the conduct of a creditor using or threatening such proceedings; and if it concludes that the creditor has used or threatened the proceedings at all oppressively, for example, in order to obtain some payment or promise from the debtor or some other collateral advantage to himself properly attributable to the use of the threat, the court will not hesitate to declare the creditor`s conduct extortionate and will not allow him to make use of the process which he has abused.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>The appellant also alleged that he did not have adequate time to consider the full effect of the terms set out in the consent order as he was then very anxious to avoid the risk of being adjudged a bankrupt.<br/><br/>We did not think there was anything in this allegation at all. At the relevant time, as the appellant was unable to pay up the debts due to the respondent and the other creditors, the latter were entitled to the bankruptcy order prayed for in their respective petitions. In acceding to his request for payment by instalments, the creditors had agreed but subject to conditions. The appellant accepted those conditions. He was then being advised by a senior member of the Bar. And we need hardly add that he himself, before he ceased his law practice, was also a senior member of the Bar. There could be no doubt that he fully appreciated the effect of the agreement reached which was reflected in the consent order. We were astonished to hear him claim that he did not know the effect of the consent order. The fact that he felt that he had to accept the terms offered because he had no other option did not mean that he did not appreciate what he was agreeing to. He obviously realised that if he did not accept the terms, then a bankruptcy order would have been made against him that very day. By accepting the terms he had bought himself time, which was to his advantage. The truth of the matter was that this was an act of indulgence, not an act of oppression.<br/><br/>It is necessary to look at what was in issue in <strong><i> Re Majory </i></strong>. There, after the issue of a specially indorsed writ claiming o800 for money lent, with o12 5s costs, and the issue of a judgment summons, the parties agreed to an arrangement for payment by instalments and the debtor was to pay the creditor`s reasonable costs. After judgment was obtained, the creditor insisted the costs payable should be o21, o8 15s more than that awarded by the judgment, representing the full amount of the legal costs which the creditor had incurred. Later, bankruptcy proceedings followed and the debtor disputed the petition on the ground that the creditor had attempted in connection with the proceedings to extort o8 15s from him in excess of the sum lawfully due. Thus, it was contended by the debtor that any arrangement made by a creditor under the shadow or threat of bankruptcy proceedings whereby the creditor might obtain from the debtor a penny more than the sum to which he was legally entitled amounted to extortion within the meaning of bankruptcy law even though there was no true element present of impropriety or oppression. There, the Court of Appeal, after an extensive review of the cases, summarised the position under the following heads ([1955] Ch 600 at 623-624; [1955] 2 All ER 65 at 78):  </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        <p>(1) There is no such hard and fast rule as Mr. Duveen suggested, namely, that any arrangement or agreement made by a petitioning creditor with his debtor, after the institution or under the shadow of bankruptcy proceedings, whereby the creditor is able to get more than that \"to which he was legally entitled\" (that is, more than he could have recovered at law at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings being started or threatened) amounts to extortion in bankruptcy law notwithstanding the absence of any mala fides or anything amounting to oppression in fact ...  </p>\n        <p>(2) There is equally no rule that extortion has in bankruptcy law a special and artificial significance divorced altogether from the ordinary implication of the word.  </p>\n        <p>(3) The so-called \"rule\" in bankruptcy is, in truth, no more than an application of a more general rule that court proceedings may not be used or threatened for the purpose of obtaining for the person so using or threatening them some collateral advantage to himself, and not for the purpose for which such proceedings are properly designed and exist; and a party so using or threatening proceedings will be liable to be held guilty of abusing the process of the court and therefore disqualified from invoking the powers of the court by proceedings he has abused.  </p>\n        <p>(4) [already quoted at [para ]25 above]  </p>\n        <p>(5) In every case it is a question of fact in all the circumstances of the case whether there has been, in truth, extortion.</p>\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>In relation to that case the English Court of Appeal held that on the facts, the creditor was not guilty of extortion, for the promise by the debtor to pay costs was given when there was no threat of bankruptcy proceedings and was not given as a result of any threat.<br/><br/>Thus, whether there is extortion is a question of fact. Reverting to the present case, on 3 November 2001, when the appellant agreed to the respondent`s terms for instalment payment the respondent was entitled to a bankruptcy order against the appellant. Unlike the position in <strong><i> Re Majory </i></strong>, the agreement did not give the respondent any cent more. All that she and the other creditors sought by that agreement was to ensure that, by giving the appellant more time to pay, their position would not be jeopardized or made worse off. We did not see how the agreement could in any way be considered to be extortionate. The respondent and  the other creditors were not attempting to obtain payment or a promise over and above what they were entitled to.<br/><br/>There was also the suggestion that the court should have disregarded the consent order pursuant to the powers conferred under s 7. We have dealt with this question above, and do not propose to reiterate those views.<br/><br/><strong><i> Judgment </i></strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>As none of the issues raised by the appellant had merit, we dismissed the appeal with costs. The security for costs (with any accrued interest) was ordered to be paid out to the respondent to account of her costs.<br/><br/><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>\n    <p>Appeal dismissed.<br/><br/></p>\n  </body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

On 1 February 2002, the accused/respondent was at Chamber E of the Family and Juvenile Courts Building for the hearing of his former wife\u2019s application for a variation of some of the orders made on ancillary issues following their divorce.\u00a0 During the hearing, he repeatedly punched the left eye and face of his wife\u2019s female lawyer in the presence of a female District Judge. The accused/respondent was sentenced by the District Court to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment on one charge of causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code (PC).\u00a0 He appealed and the High Court enhanced his sentence to one of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u00a0 The maximum punishment prescribed by s 325 for the offence is only 7 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u00a0 The High Court held that it was entitled to impose a prison sentence of 10 years by virtue of the power conferred upon it under the proviso to s 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0 As the Public Prosecutor had before the date set for the hearing of this reference advised that he would be arguing in favour of a negative answer to the question under reference, and so would be the accused/respondent, and, pursuant to the suggestion of the Public Prosecutor, this court appointed Davinder Singh SC, as <i>Amicus Curiae</i>,\u00a0 with a clear indication that his task was to advance arguments in favour of a positive reply to the question.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Scheme under the CPC</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0 The issue is to determine the proper interpretation of s 11(3) of the CPC, in particular its proviso.\u00a0 This necessarily entails an examination of the subsection and its proviso, to establish its object and scope.\u00a0 We will, at this juncture, set out the subsection in full:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11(3)\u00a0 A District Court may pass any of the following sentences:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0 imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0 fine not exceeding $10,000;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">c)\u00a0 caning up to 12 strokes;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)\u00a0 any lawful sentence combining any of the sentences which it is authorised by law to pass;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(e)\u00a0 reformative training:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Provided that where a District Court has convicted any person and it appears that by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents, a punishment in excess of that prescribed in this subsection should be awarded, then the District Court may sentence that person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and shall record its reason for so doing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0 The reasoning of the High Court, in holding that the proviso to s 11(3) empowered it to sentence the accused respondent to a term exceeding that provided in s 325, is the following:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cHowever, the proviso to s 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) empowers a district court to sentence a person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents provided that the court records its reason for so doing.\u00a0 Unlike the proviso to s 11(5) which limits the punishment which a magistrate\u2019s court can award to \u2018the full punishment authorised by law for the offence, for which that person has been convicted\u2019 there is no such restriction on the district court\u2019s powers under the s 11(3) proviso.\u00a0 Moreover, on a purposive interpretation, it is unlikely that Parliament intended the restriction under s 11(5) to be read into the proviso to s 11(3), since otherwise there would be extremely few cases which would warrant its use at all.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0 It will be useful to begin by first looking at the scheme of things under the CPC.\u00a0 Part II of the CPC, which covers s 6 to s 19, is intitled \u201cConstitution and Powers of Criminal Courts.\u201d\u00a0 Section 6 provides that the High Court, District Courts and Magistrates Courts are the criminal courts.\u00a0 Section 7 sets out the general criminal jurisdiction of the District Courts which is to try all offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law does not exceed 10 years, except where the Public Prosecutor applies, and the accused consents, a District Court may try any offence other than an offence punishable with death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0 Section 8 sets out the criminal jurisdiction of Magistrates Courts which is, <i>inter alia</i>, to try offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law does not exceed 3 years or which are punishable with fine only.\u00a0 However, s 9 gives a Magistrate\u2019s Court and a District Court extended trial jurisdiction as regards certain specified offence set out in Schedule A to the CPC.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0 Section 10 permits an offence triable by a District Court under s 9 to be tried by a Magistrates\u2019 Court when so authorized by the Public Prosecutor but such an authorization does not enlarge the sentencing power of the Magistrate\u2019s court conferred under s 11(5).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0 Section 11 is concerned with the sentencing jurisdiction of the courts.\u00a0 Subsection (1) provides that the High Court has the power to pass any sentence authorized by law, but it may not impose all three forms of punishment, i.e., imprisonment, fine and canning, for the same offence.\u00a0 Subsection (2) empowers the High Court in respect of an accused who is again convicted of an offence which is punishable with a term of 2 years or upwards, to direct that he be subject to police supervision of up to 3 years, after the expiration of the sentence passed on him for the last of those offences.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0 Subsection (3) has already been quoted and we will return to it in a moment.\u00a0 Subsection (4) is similar to subsection (2) and it empowers the District Court to impose a supervision order of up to 2 years on a repeat\u00a0 offender.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0 Subsection 5 relates to the sentencing jurisdiction of a Magistrate\u2019s Court and as this provision played an important part in the High Court\u2019s reasoning in coming to its decision that the s 11(3) proviso empowers the District Court to impose a sentence in excess of the maximum prescribed by law for the offence, and is also relied upon in Mr Davinder Singh\u2019s argument in favour of a positive reply to the question, it is necessary that we set it out in full:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201c11(5) A Magistrate\u2019s Court may pass any of the following sentences:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 years;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 fine not exceeding $2,000;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 caning up to 6 strokes;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 any lawful sentence combining any of the</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sentences which it is authorised by law to</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pass:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Provided that where a Magistrate\u2019s Court has convicted any person and it appears that, by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents, a punishment in excess of that prescribed by this subsection should be awarded, then the Magistrate\u2019s Court may award the full punishment authorised by law for the offence for which that person has been convicted and shall record its reason for so doing.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0 Subsection (6) is also similar to subsection (2) and it empowers a Magistrate\u2019s Court to impose a supervision order on a repeat offender, but only up to 1 year.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0 Subsection (7) is an overriding provision and it provides that where in any law a District Court or Magistrate\u2019s Court is given the power to award punishment in\u00a0 excess of those laid down in s 11, it may do so.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0 Section 12 of the CPC empowers the High Court and a District Court, where the conditions specified\u00a0 therein are satisfied, to impose, in lieu of the sentence prescribed by law for the offence in respect of which the accused has been convicted, sentence him to corrective training for a term of between 5 and 14 years or preventive detention of 7 to 20 years.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0 From the provisions of the CPC mentioned above, three aspects should be clearly differentiated and kept distinct:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(i)\u00a0 the trial jurisdiction of the court;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(ii) the sentencing jurisdiction of the court;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(iii) the maximum punishment prescribed for the offence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As would be seen from ss 7, 8 and 11, the normal sentencing jurisdiction of a District Court or Magistrate Court is not the same as its trial jurisdiction.\u00a0 The sentencing jurisdiction is lower than the trial jurisdiction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0 The distinction between sentencing jurisdiction and the maximum penalty prescribed by law for an offence was brought out in the case of <i>Harry Lee Wee v PP</i> [1980-81] SLR 301.\u00a0 There, Harry Wee was tried in 1978 for offences committed in 1976.\u00a0 At the time of the offences, s 17 of the CPC provided that where an accused was charged with multiple offences, the jurisdiction of the District Court to impose fine was limited to a maximum of twice its normal sentencing jurisdiction as to fine of $5,000.\u00a0 An amendment to s 17, which came into force in 1977, but before the date of the trial, removed the restrictions relating to the aggregate of fines.\u00a0 The District Court,\u00a0 relying on the new powers granted under the amended s 17, imposed fines in excess of those allowed under the previous s 17.\u00a0\u00a0 Harry Wee contended that he was made to \u201csuffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed.\u201d\u00a0 Choor Singh J rejected the argument as follows:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThere is clearly some confusion on counsel\u2019s part for he has failed to distinguish between \u2018punishment prescribed for an offence\u2019 and \u2018powers of a court\u2019 to impose punishment.\u00a0 The punishment for an offence under s 213 of the Penal Code is laid down in that section.\u00a0 There has been no change in the punishment prescribed in s 213 between the date of the offences and the date of the appellant\u2019s trial.\u00a0 The change that has taken place is in the powers of a district court to impose fines.\u00a0 Whereas at the date of the appellant\u2019s offences in 1976 a district court could not impose fines totalling more than $10,000 it could do so at the date of his trial in 1978.\u00a0 It is not understood how this change can affect the appellant. \u00a0 No <i>ex post facto</i> legislation has been enacted altering or increasing, the punishment under s 213 of the Penal code.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0 This case of <i>Harry Lee Wee v PP</i> also illustrates the distinction between procedural law and substantive law.\u00a0 Whereas procedural law, such as the sentencing jurisdiction of the court, will be applied retrospectively, substantive law, such as the sentence which may be imposed for an offence, may not be applied retrospectively.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0 Exceptions aside, it would be seen from the above that the ordinary jurisdiction of the District Court is to try offences which are not punishable with more than ten years\u2019 imprisonment.\u00a0 But its powers to impose imprisonment term is not co-terminus with its trial jurisdiction and is restricted to only seven years.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Interpretation of s 11(3)</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0 The difference of view lies in the effect of the proviso to s 11(3).\u00a0 The High Court, which relied on the literal rule of interpretation, held that the second part of the proviso, i.e., \u201cthen the District Court may sentence that person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years\u201d\u00a0 is clear and means what it says.\u00a0 This is also Mr Singh\u2019s submission.\u00a0 The effect of this argument is that whatever may be the offence upon which an accused has been convicted, and whatever may be the prescribed maximum punishment for that offence, the District Court would be entitled to sentence the accused, provided the condition in the proviso is satisfied, to a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0 It is only possible to give a positive answer to the question under reference if one looks exclusively at the words \u201cthe District Court may sentence that person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years\u201d and nothing else. However, while the normal rule of interpretation is the literal rule, one must look at the provision as a whole.\u00a0 Words, by their nature, are often capable of being interpreted in several ways.\u00a0 It is the context which will indicate which of the possibilities is the proper interpretation.\u00a0 Thus, the literal interpretation must have regard to the context in which those words appear.\u00a0 <i>Driedger on Construction of Statutes (3<sup>rd</sup> Edition)</i> puts the point in perspective as follows:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThe meaning of a word depends on the context in which it is used. This basic principle of communication applies to all texts including legislation.\u00a0 It is reflected in the fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that to understand the meaning of legislation, the words of the text must be read in context.\u00a0 This principle has long been recognised. \u00a0 As Viscount Simonds wrote in <i>AG v Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover</i>:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026 words, and particularly general words, cannot be read in isolation; their colour and their content are derived from their context.\u00a0 So it is that I conceive it to be my right and duty to examine every word of a statute in its context, and I use \u201ccontext\u201d in its widest sense \u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">More recently, in <i>Prassad v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration),</i> Sopinka J wrote:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In order to arrive at the correct interpretation of statutory provisions that are susceptible of different meanings, they must be examined in the setting in which they appear.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0 Indeed s 9A of our Interpretation Act requires the court to give statutory provisions a purposive interpretation.\u00a0 This principle of interpretation has also been reaffirmed in numerous cases.\u00a0 In <i>Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 SLR 201</nobr>, this court enunciated the principle to be applied as follows:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThe principle to be applied is that the words of the Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the intention of Parliament: EA Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 1983) p 87.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0 It is not in dispute that s 11 deals with the sentencing jurisdiction of the High Court [in subs (1) and (2)], the District Court [in subs (3) and (4)] and the Magistrate\u2019s Court [in subs (5) and (6)].\u00a0 Quite clearly, the main provision of subsection (3) prescribes the ordinary maximum sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court.\u00a0 The question that remains is whether or not there is anything in the proviso which suggests that it is not restricted to the matters dealt with in the main provision of that subsection.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0 It is an established rule of statutory construction that ordinarily a proviso qualifies or explains the main provision.\u00a0 In <i>Lloyd &amp; Scottish Finance Ltd v Motor Cars &amp; Caravans (Kingston) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1966] 1 QB 764</nobr> at 780 Edmund Davies J said \u201cthe proviso must of necessity be limited in its operation to the ambit of the section which it qualifies.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0 But we recognise that it does not follow that a proviso must be so construed in every case.\u00a0 A proviso can very well go beyond the scope of the main provision and be a substantive provision of its own.\u00a0 This is explained in the case of <i>Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Atwill</i> <nobr>[1973] AC 558</nobr>, a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the High Court of Australia and which concerned the <i>Australian Stamp Duties Act 1920</i>.\u00a0 There, the Privy Council held (at 561):-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThe decision of the majority of the High Court was thus based on the view that the proviso was a true proviso limiting or qualifying what preceded it.\u00a0 Their Lordships are not able to agree with this conclusion.\u00a0 While in many cases that is the function of a proviso, it is the substance and content of the enactment, not its form, which has to be considered, and that which is expressed to be a proviso may itself add to and not merely limit or qualify that which precedes it.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0 We will now examine the subject proviso.\u00a0 Section 11(3) provides that a District Court may pass any of the sentences listed.\u00a0 There cannot be any doubt that s 11(3)(a), in providing that a District Court may pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years, does not mean that a District Court may sentence an offender to imprisonment of up to 7 years even though the offence itself only carries a prison term of up to say 3 years.\u00a0 Turning to the proviso, the first part sets out the premise, i.e., \u201cwhere a District Court has convicted a person and it appears that by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents, a punishment in excess of that prescribed in this subsection should be awarded\u201d, upon which the enhanced sentencing jurisdiction may be invoked. \u00a0 We would emphasise, in particular, the phrase \u201ca punishment in excess of that <u>prescribed in this subsection</u>.\u201d\u00a0 This clearly shows the link of the proviso to the main provision in subsection (3).\u00a0 Thus, up to that point, there is no indication whatsoever that anything outside the scope of the subsection itself is contemplated.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0 The next question that follows relates to whether or not there is anything in the second part of the proviso which indicates that Parliament had intended to go outside the scope of the main provision of subsection (3).\u00a0 We do not think so.\u00a0 There is only a slight change in terms of wording.\u00a0 Whereas the main provision provides that the District Court \u201cmay pass\u201d any of the listed sentences, in the proviso it is stated that the District Court \u201cmay sentence\u201d the accused person to a term not exceeding 10 years.\u00a0 There is, in effect, no real difference between the two formulations.\u00a0 It seems to us the reason why the word \u201cpass\u201d is used instead of \u201csentence\u201d in the main provision is that if the word \u201cpass\u201d were to be replaced by the word \u201csentence\u201d, it would not, as a matter of language, sit well with item (d) therein.\u00a0 This aside, nothing in the second part of the proviso suggests that Parliament had intended to alter the substantive punishment which the accused is liable for, besides just enhancing the sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court from seven years to ten years for a repeat offender.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0 It stands to reason that if Parliament had intended something more, or different, it would surely have provided in more specific terms as it did in s 12 when it empowered the court to impose corrective training and preventive detention.\u00a0 A simple comparison of the wording used in s 12(1) with that in the s 11(3) proviso will bear this out.\u00a0 Section 12(1) says: \u201cthe court \u2026 shall pass, <u>in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment</u>, a sentence of corrective training for such term of not less than 5 not more than 14 years as the court may determine.\u201d\u00a0 Similar wording is used in s 12(2) which empowers the court to impose a sentence of preventive detention.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0 Parliament could not have intended by way of a proviso to a provision dealing with the sentencing power of the District Court, and without even using terms such as \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d \u201cdisregarding\u201d or \u201cin lieu of\u201d, to allow the District Court to disregard the maximum sentence prescribed for an offence.\u00a0 Otherwise, the result will be that whenever an accused person, who has previously been convicted of an offence, is again convicted of another offence, then notwithstanding what may have been the maximum punishment prescribed by law for that second or subsequent offence, and no matter how trivial the latter offence may be, say maximum prison term of 6 months or 2 years,\u00a0 the District Court is entitled to impose a sentence for that second or subsequent offence of up to ten years.\u00a0 It would effectively mean that for a repeat offender, the maximum punishment prescribed by law for that second or subsequent offence would be abrogated. Parliament would not have made such a drastic change to the substantive criminal law through some general wording in a proviso to a provision dealing with the sentencing capacity of the court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0 Moreover, a positive answer to the question of law referred to this court would give rise to an anomaly.\u00a0 If the same accused were to be tried before the High Court, the latter would not have the power to impose an imprisonment term of up to ten years because the proviso to subsection (3) does not apply to the High Court.\u00a0 It only applies to the District Court.\u00a0 In this connection, one must draw a distinction between the High Court exercising its appellate jurisdiction and the High Court exercising its original jurisdiction.\u00a0 In respect of the former situation, the High Court would have the powers of the District Court.\u00a0 But it is not so in the latter situation.\u00a0 Mr Singh argued that there will not be any anomaly because the High Court can still exercise the enhanced sentencing power conferred on the District Court by the s 11(3) proviso by virtue of the doctrine of inherent jurisdiction.\u00a0 In support of this line of argument, he relied upon a passage in a lecture entitled <i>\u201cThe Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court\u201d</i> given by I.H Jacobs, and published in <i>Current Legal Problems</i> <i>1970,</i> Vol 23 p 23 at 24-25.\u00a0 We do not think it is necessary for us to reproduce in extenso what the author said which was quoted by Mr Singh, other than this one paragraph:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThe inherent jurisdiction of the court is exercisable as part of the process of the administration of justice.\u00a0 <u>It is part of procedural law, both civil and criminal, and not of substantive law</u>; it is invoked in relation to the process of litigation.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0 With respect, we think this argument has overlooked the fact that the doctrine of inherent jurisdiction is only concerned with procedural matters.\u00a0 It cannot be invoked to alter the substantive law, all the more so in relation to substantive criminal law.\u00a0 The general sentencing power of the High Court is set out in s 11(1) and (2).\u00a0 There is nothing in those two subsections which empowers the High Court to disregard the maximum punishment prescribed by law for the offence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0 On this argument, Mr Singh also relied upon the Australian case of <i>North Sydney</i> <i>Municipal Council v Comfytex Pty Ltd &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1975] NSWLR 44</nobr>.\u00a0 There the court was construing a provision which sought to limit the common law powers of a superior court to issue injunction and held that the words were insufficient to curtail the powers of the court.\u00a0 Street CJ said (at 450):-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cIt is a long recognised and salutary principle that the wide-ranging jurisdiction of a superior court is not to be treated as limited or abrogated by anything short of a clear expression of legislative intention to that effect \u2026\u00a0 Being the court charged with unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction, and bearing the duty of presiding over the whole system of justice, a superior court will not recognise legislative limitations on its powers, unless those limitations are express.\u00a0 <i>\u2018Boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem\u2019,</i> in its distorted connotation: <i>Broome\u2019s Legal Maxims, 9<sup>th</sup> ed.</i> p. 57, is a sound maxim for a superior court to bear in mind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0 In fact, this passage reinforces the point we advanced herein.\u00a0 Inasmuch as clear and express words are required to curtail the powers of the superior court, it must also follow that clear and specific words must be there before enhanced punishment, in excess of that prescribed for the offence, may be imposed on an accused.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0 Again, another case, <i>Grobbelaar v News Groups Newspaper</i> [2002] 4 All ER 732, which was relied upon by Mr Singh, does not advance his arguments any further.\u00a0 There what was held was that an appellate tribunal, in deciding an appeal, had the inherent power to make any order which the court below could have made.\u00a0 This proposition we accept.\u00a0 But it is altogether a different proposition to say that the High Court, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, may exercise statutory powers which Parliament has conferred on an inferior court but not on the High Court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0 The weakness of the argument based on inherent jurisdiction is that, if carried to its logical conclusion, it would mean that the High Court, in exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, may sentence a habitual offender to a term of imprisonment longer than that prescribed by law for the offence he is charged.\u00a0 But this would run counter to the plain enactment of s 11(1) which provides that the sentencing jurisdiction of the High Court is to pass any sentence authorised by law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0 The argument of Mr Singh on the scope of the proviso produces a strange result.\u00a0 While, the High Court has unlimited trial jurisdiction and unlimited sentencing power, it is subject, as provided in s 11(1), to passing any sentence authorized by law.\u00a0 Yet, on Mr Singh\u2019s argument, the s 11(3) proviso would empower the District Court to disregard the maximum sentence prescribed by law, something which even the High Court cannot do.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Section 41 of Interpretation Act</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0 The construction which we have placed on the s 11(3) proviso is wholly consistent with s 41 of the Interpretation Act which reads:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cWhenever in any written law a penalty is\u00a0 provided for an offence, such provision shall imply that such offence shall be punishable upon conviction by a penalty not exceeding (except as may be otherwise expressly mentioned in the written law) the penalty provided.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0 The term \u201cwritten law\u201d is defined in the Interpretation Act to include Acts and subsidiary legislation.\u00a0 The effect of s 41 is that a court may only impose the punishment for the offence prescribed by law and nothing more unless, in the words set out in parenthesis, \u201cexpressly mentioned in <u>the</u> written law.\u201d\u00a0 There is some controversy as to whether the word \u201c<u>the</u>\u201d before \u201cwritten law\u201d refers to \u201c<u>any</u>\u201d written law mentioned in the beginning of s 41.\u00a0 We are inclined to think that <u>the</u> written law could not have referred to <u>any</u> written law first mentioned in that section, although for the purposes of the present reference, we need not express a definitive opinion on it.\u00a0 The relevance of s 41 to our case here is really the prescription that anything \u201cotherwise\u201d must be \u201cexpressly\u201d provided.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0 We do not agree that the words in the proviso \u201cthe District Court may sentence that person to imprisonment for \u2026 10 years\u201d in a subsection dealing with the sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court can be construed to mean that Parliament intended to give the District Court the power to do away with the maximum sentence prescribed by law as far as a habitual offender is concerned. It is a fundamental tenet of criminal justice that an offender may not be punished with more than the maximum penalty prescribed by the offence provision.\u00a0 Very clear words are required to override that and such words are entirely missing in the s 11(3) proviso.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Comparison with the s 11(5) proviso</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">39\u00a0 We now turn to consider the s 11(5) proviso.\u00a0 It was argued that if Parliament had intended that the sentencing jurisdiction conferred on the District Court is subject to the maximum punishment prescribed for the offence it would have used the same wording as that used in the s 11(5) proviso which lays down that the Magistrate\u2019s Court may award \u201cthe full punishment authorised by law for the offence.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">40\u00a0 As we see it, the first question to ask is whether there is any difference in the object of the s 11(5) proviso and the s 11(3) proviso.\u00a0 In both instances, Parliament intended to confer upon the District Court and the Magistrate\u2019s Court enhanced jurisdiction as to sentencing as far as habitual offenders are concerned.\u00a0 For the District Court, it adopted an absolute cut-off limit of 10 years.\u00a0 In the case of the Magistrate\u2019s Court, it did not adopt an absolute cut-off limit but instead gave the court the power to sentence up to the maximum authorised by law for the offence in question.\u00a0\u00a0 While the formulations used are different, the object remains very much the same:\u00a0 to enhance the court\u2019s sentencing jurisdiction, and not to enhance the punishment for the offence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">41\u00a0 While we recognise that Parliament could have inserted in the s 11(3) proviso the expression \u201cthe full punishment authorised by law\u201d, it does not follow that its omission means Parliament intended to confer upon the District Court the power to override the maximum sentence prescribed in the offence provision.\u00a0 In this connection Mr Singh relied upon the English Criminal Justice Act 1991 to submit that there was a general practice among overseas legislatures to use \u201cexpress language to limit the sentencing powers of the court to the ambit of the offence-creating statute\u201d.\u00a0 First, we do not think the UK drafting practice is altogether relevant.\u00a0 Second, as the DPP has shown, the practice in UK is not uniform.\u00a0 Third, it does not follow that just because of the drafting style adopted in the English Criminal Justice Act 1991, a new principle of statutory interpretation has arisen which requires the use of \u201cexpress language to limit the sentencing powers of the court to the ambit of the offence-creating statute.\u201d\u00a0 There is force in the Public Prosecutor\u2019s argument that for a sentencing jurisdiction clause to expressly say that the sentencing powers are subject to the limits of the offence-creating provision is to say the obvious.\u00a0 That is, after all, a long established jurisprudential principle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">42\u00a0 Again we would emphasise the distinction between sentencing jurisdiction of the court and the maximum punishment which may be imposed by the court for an offence. Unless this distinction is kept clearly in mind,\u00a0 misunderstanding is likely to arise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">43\u00a0 In this regard, it is pertinent to note a related principle enunciated by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Zimmerman v Grossman</i> [1971] 1 All ER 363 that where penal provisions were framed in wide and ambiguous language they should be restrictively construed and where there were two possible meanings the court should adopt the more lenient one.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Legislative history</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">44\u00a0 One may ask why did Parliament adopt a different set of words in the s 11(3) proviso, in contrast with that in the s 11(5) proviso.\u00a0 Reference was made by both the DPP and Mr Singh to the legislative history behind s 11(3) and (5).\u00a0 It is true that when the s 11(3) proviso was first introduced in the Singapore Legislative Assembly in 1959, it contained words similar to the s 11(5) proviso including the expression \u201cfull punishment authorised by law\u201d.\u00a0 The proviso then read:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cProvided that where a District Court has convicted any person in exercise of its jurisdiction under subsection (1) of section 8 of this Code and it appears that by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents, a punishment in excess of that prescribed in this section should be awarded, then such District Court may award the full punishment authorised by law for the offence of which such a person has been convicted and shall record its reason for so doing.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">45\u00a0 However, at the Select Committee, this phrase was replaced by the phrase \u201cimprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years\u201d (seven years was then the limit).\u00a0 No explanation was given for this amendment either in the Select Committee report or during the Third Reading of the amended Bill in the Legislative Assembly.\u00a0 Furthermore, the words \u201cin exercise of its jurisdiction under subsection (1) of section 8 of this Code\u201d were deleted and the word \u201csection\u201d replaced by \u201csubsection\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">46\u00a0 The DPP has offered various reasons, and not without some persuasiveness,\u00a0 why the amendments were made by the Select Committee.\u00a0 In the absence of any official reasons offered by the Select Committee, or by the relevant Minister in the Third Reading debates, which could assist the court in the interpretation thereof, we do not think it would really be profitable to go into all that.\u00a0 We are here dealing with criminal law and the liberty of the subject.\u00a0 It is an established canon of construction that the court should not construe a provision in an Act to alter substantive law, all the more so in relation to criminal law, unless there are clear specific words to that effect.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">47\u00a0 In this regard, it may be of interest to note what the Minister said in Parliament when introducing amendments to the CPC in 1975.\u00a0 In 1974, the Prisons Reorganisations Committee appointed by the Minister submitted its report.\u00a0 The following were two of the many recommendations which it made:-</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201c<u>Enhanced Penalties</u></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1.2.3\u00a0 We recommend that the prosecutors and the Courts make greater use of section 75 of the Penal Code and section 35 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.\u00a0 Broadly speaking, these sections empower the Courts to impose enhanced penalties on repeat offenders.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><u><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Jurisdiction of the Courts</span></u></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1.2.7\u00a0 the speedy dispensation of justice requires that the burden of the High Court be reduced by enhancing the powers of the lower courts.\u00a0 We propose that the Criminal Procedure Code be amended so as to:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 enhance the jurisdiction of the District Courts from 3 to 5 years for first offenders;

He added that the proviso was meant to fill a gap and to target those repeat offenders who have not offended as frequently or seriously as to trigger the imposition of corrective training or preventive detention under s 12(1) and (2) of the CPC.\u00a0 Counsel also went into various hypothetical scenarios to show how anomalies could arise and why the s 11(3) proviso should be construed as a substantive provision.\u00a0 With respect, all that is speculation.\u00a0 It is not for the courts to fill in gaps in the criminal law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">50\u00a0 Mr Singh also spent a considerable part of his submission dealing with the need for enhanced penalty to protect society.\u00a0 He pointed out that being tough with repeat offenders is a phenomenon found not only in Singapore but also in other countries. This is not disputed. But the question before us is a narrower one.\u00a0 What is the scope of the s 11(3) proviso?\u00a0 It is clear that when Parliament intended that enhanced punishment, outside the limit set by the offence provision, should be applied, it had always done so expressly, e.g., s 12 of CPC, s 75 of PC and s 35 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, leaving no room for any doubt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">51\u00a0 Clearly, the object of the s 11(3) proviso was to bridge the gap between the basic trial jurisdiction and the basic sentencing power of the District Court.\u00a0 Before 1960, the basic trial jurisdiction of the District Court was limited to offences punishable up to three years and the sentencing power of the District Court was the same.\u00a0 The amendments that came into force that year brought about a change.\u00a0 The basic trial jurisdiction of the District Court was raised to 7 years but its sentencing power remained at 3 years.\u00a0 A similar disparity also occurred for the first time for the Magistrate\u2019s Court, namely, trial jurisdiction of 3 years and sentencing power of 1 year.\u00a0 Thus, on that occasion Parliament introduced the provisos to s 11(3) and (5) to give the District Court and the Magistrate\u2019s Court enhanced sentencing jurisdiction to deal with habitual offenders.\u00a0 At the Second Reading of the amendment Bill, the Minister explained that the changes to the trial jurisdiction of the District Court was to \u2013</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cenable a large number of cases, which are at present tried in the High Court, to be tried in the Criminal District Court, and they will result not only in a saving of time of the High Court, but also, by reason of the fact that it will not be necessary to hold preliminary inquiries, it will result in the saving of time of the Magistrate\u2019s Court.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">52\u00a0 With the large number of cases being sent down to the District court, which then had a sentencing power of only 3 years, it was necessary that the District Court should have enhanced sentencing power to deal with habitual offenders.\u00a0 Thus, the proviso to s 11(3) which conferred upon the District Court the enhanced sentencing jurisdiction of up to 7 years (this was then the limit).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Limited application</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">53\u00a0 We will now turn to deal with some miscellaneous points.\u00a0 Another argument advanced for holding that the s 11(3) proviso should be given its literal meaning is that otherwise, there would be extremely few instances to which the proviso would be applicable.\u00a0 Two short points may be made in response.\u00a0 First, it should not be in the least surprising that the enhanced sentencing jurisdiction would only apply in a limited number of cases.\u00a0 Second, it is not entirely true that if the negative answer is given to the question, extremely few cases would be attracted by it.\u00a0 Even according to the calculation of Mr Singh, 47 offences carry a maximum punishment of more than 7 years\u2019 imprisonment, not counting attempting, abetting and conspiracy to commit those offences.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">An apparent anomaly</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">54\u00a0 The point was made that if a negative answer is given to the question, an apparent anomaly can arise. The enhanced sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court is up to 10 years and that of the Magistrate\u2019s Court is up to the full punishment for the offence.\u00a0 Take s 409 of the PC, criminal breach of trust by a public servant, an offence punishable with life imprisonment.\u00a0 If an accused is charged for that offence before a District Court and he has antecedents, the District Court can only sentence him to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.\u00a0 But if he is charged before a Magistrate\u2019s Court, pursuant to an authorisation by the Public Prosecutor under s 10 of the CPC, the Magistrate\u2019s Court could sentence him to life imprisonment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">55\u00a0 But the anomaly will be there no matter which view one takes as to the proper interpretation of the proviso to s 11(3).\u00a0 The anomaly does not arise out of the proviso.\u00a0 Perhaps it was an oversight on the part of the draftsman when the various amendments were made to the CPC.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Conclusion</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">56\u00a0 Finally, we would like to express our appreciation to the DPP, Mr Pang Khang Chau, the <i>Amicus Curiae</i>, Mr Davinder Singh SC, and the counsel for the respondent, Mr Michael Khoo SC, and their respective assistants, for their invaluable assistance in this reference.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

These proceedings are yet another chapter in the long history of litigation between the parties, the background of which we have previously set out in <i>Murakami Takako v Wiryadi Louise Maria</i> <nobr>[2007] 4 SLR 565</nobr> (\u201c<i>Murakami Takako</i>\u201d) at [3]\u2013[5].</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In these proceedings, the appellant, acting on behalf of the estate of her late father, Takashi Murakami Suroso (\u201cthe Testator\u201d), applied to include certain amendments which would expand her claim to include the following:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 moneys contained in two bank accounts with Westpac Bank in Australia (\u201cthe moneys in the Australian bank accounts\u201d);</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 five immovable properties and sale proceeds from three other immovable properties situated in Australia; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 four immovable properties and sale proceeds from one other immovable property situated in Indonesia.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge allowed only the amendments pertaining to the moneys in the Australian bank accounts. He held that the court had no jurisdiction over the claims to the specified foreign immovable properties (\u201cthe foreign immovable properties\u201d) and the sale proceeds from the other specified foreign immovable properties (\u201cthe other foreign properties\u201d), and that, even if the court had jurisdiction, he would have declined to exercise it on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The issues on appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The respondents have not appealed against the decision of the Judge to allow the amendments pertaining to the moneys in the Australian bank accounts and their counsel has confirmed that they are content to rest with that decision. Therefore, the issues that arise for our consideration pertain only to whether the Judge rightly disallowed the amendments with regard to the foreign immovable properties and the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge held that the appellant\u2019s claims to the foreign immovable properties and the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties (\u201cthe Claims\u201d) were caught by the rule in <i>The British South Africa Company v The Companhia de Mo\u00e7ambique</i> [1893] AC 602 (\u201cthe <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule\u201d), the effect of which is that the court has no jurisdiction to determine the title to, or the right to possession of, any immovable property situated outside the forum. The Judge considered one of the main exceptions to the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule, <i>viz</i>, that jurisdiction could be assumed where the claim was in equity (\u201cthe personal equities exception\u201d), and held that it did not apply on the facts of the present case.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the words of a leading expert in the field (see Adrian Briggs, <i>Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments</i> (LLP, 4th\u00a0Ed, 2005) at para\u00a04.06), the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">... reflects the practical fact that only at the <i>situs</i></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">of the land can there be an effective determination of title. Even if an English court [in these proceedings, a Singapore court] were to hear the case, and were to choose and apply the law which a court at the <i>situs</i> would itself have applied, it is probable that its judgment will be ignored at the <i>situs</i> as one coming from a court with no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue. Acceptance of this fact is the pragmatic reason why the court has no jurisdiction to try questions of disputed title to foreign land. And because the issue is one where the court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the claim, the purported submission of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court is irrelevant: what the court lacks is subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[One] \u2026 exception [to the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule] is ancient and equitable in origin. According to the principle laid down in <i>Penn</i> v. <i>Lord\u00a0Baltimore</i> [(1750) 1\u00a0Ves\u00a0Sen 444; 27\u00a0ER 1132], though a court may have no jurisdiction to try a question of title to the land, this does not affect its jurisdiction to adjudicate on and enforce a contract, or fiduciary or other equitable obligation, between and binding on the parties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although a vigorous assault was made on the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule in the House of Lords decision of <i>Hesperides Hotels Ltd v Muftizade</i> [1979] AC 508, the rule (as well as its exceptions, including the personal equities exception) was ultimately affirmed in that case (notwithstanding the court\u2019s acknowledgment of the various critiques of the rule itself). Indeed, Lord\u00a0Wilberforce was of the view that the nature of the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule was such that any possible reform would need to be effected via legislation instead of judicial decision (see <i>id</i> at 537).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is important to note \u2212 particularly in the context of the present proceedings and for reasons that will become apparent in the course of this judgment \u2212 that the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule is one of <i>subject-matter</i> <i>jurisdiction</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is equally important to note that the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule and the personal equities exception are part of Singapore law (see the decision of this court in <i>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 97</nobr> (\u201c<i>Eng Liat Kiang</i>\u201d) at 100\u2013103, [11]\u2013[19], where the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule was assumed to be (as also noted in the preceding paragraph) one relating to <i>jurisdiction</i>). The court, therefore, generally has no jurisdiction over claims to foreign immovable properties except for, <i>inter alia</i>, claims in equity with respect to equitable obligations. In this case, the Claims lie in equity; they are trust claims. It follows that the personal equities exception <i>prima facie</i> applies and the court has jurisdiction over the Claims. The crux of this appeal is therefore twofold, namely:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether the Judge correctly found that the court did not have jurisdiction over the Claims; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if the court indeed has jurisdiction, whether the Judge rightly declined to exercise it on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addressing these issues, the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the foreign immovable properties and the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties will be considered together. We do not agree with counsel for the appellant that the claims to the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties are no different from the claim relating to the moneys in the Australian bank accounts. This argument ignores the different legal bases of the respective claims.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The basis of the appellant\u2019s claim to the moneys in the Australian bank accounts is the assertion that those were funds provided by the Testator. On the other hand, the success of the claims to the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties rests on the appellant demonstrating the Testator\u2019s interest, if any, in the other foreign properties before they were sold. This is because any interest which the Testator had in the said sale proceeds would have flowed from an interest in the other foreign properties. Therefore, in adjudicating on the claims to the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties, the court would necessarily have to consider the Testator\u2019s interest in those properties. This, in turn, raises the question of jurisdiction over those properties. We will therefore deal with the foreign immovable properties and the sale proceeds from the other foreign properties together.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The requirements for the assumption of equitable jurisdiction</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Judge held that the court could not assume equitable jurisdiction for two reasons. First, the dispute was not sufficiently connected to the forum so as to warrant equity\u2019s assistance. Second, the Judge commented, by way of <i>obiter dicta</i>, that it was also arguable that the appellant\u2019s equity had already been extinguished by the <i>lex situs</i>. We will consider these reasons in turn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong><em>Is a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum a prerequisite to the assumption of equitable jurisdiction?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In support of the proposition that a sufficient connection between the forum and the dispute was required before the court could assume equitable jurisdiction, the Judge relied (see the GD at [24]) on an extract from R\u00a0W\u00a0White\u2019s article, \u201cEquitable Obligations in Private International Law: The Choice of Law\u201d (1986) 11\u00a0Syd\u00a0LR 92 (\u201cWhite\u2019s article\u201d) at 106, which was cited at para\u00a01.18 of T\u00a0M\u00a0Yeo, <i>Choice of Law for Equitable Doctrines</i> (Oxford University Press, 2004) (\u201cYeo\u2019s book\u201d), the leading work in the field. The above extract from White\u2019s article reads as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A defendant could not reasonably be expected to conform to the principles of English equity if his connection with England were as tenuous as mere presence at the time of service. It seems that instead of applying choice of law rules to a dispute the Court insisted that there be a sufficient connection between the parties or the cause of action and England.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">This short extract from White\u2019s article does, at first blush, appear to suggest that, in England, the courts of equity would only assume jurisdiction where the dispute was sufficiently connected to the forum. With respect, however, this extract must be read in the context of White\u2019s article as a whole. When so read, it becomes clear that the learned author was referring in the extract set out in the preceding paragraph to the strict jurisdictional rules of the Court of Chancery which held sway in England <i>prior to</i> 1873. White sought to explain how these old jurisdictional rules also functioned as a <i>proxy</i> for choice of law analysis in the past. Put simply, the net result was a <i>conflation</i> of the rules of jurisdiction on the one hand and those relating to the choice of law on the other. The main issue before us in the present appeal is whether or not the old jurisdictional rules just referred to <i>continue to apply today.</i> The related issue as to whether or not there ought to be a conflation of jurisdictional rules and choice of law rules will (as we shall see) figure prominently when we consider the case law that was relied upon by the Judge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as the former issue mentioned at the end of the preceding paragraph is concerned, White recognised \u2013 correctly, in our view \u2013 that, with the enactment of the Judicature Act 1873 (c\u00a066) (UK) (as well as subsequent developments), the strict jurisdictional rules applied by the Court of Chancery, which required a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum, were <i>abandoned</i>, there having been a fusion of the administration of justice by both the courts of common law and the Court of Chancery. The learned author explains this (very significant) development as follows (see White\u2019s article ([13] <i>supra</i>) at 104\u2013105):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">... The concept of jurisdiction applicable in the Court of Chancery was not based on mere presence and service, but upon a sufficient connection being shown between the dispute and the forum. That connection existed if the defendant were resident or domiciled in England, the cause of action arose there, or the subject matter of the dispute was situated there.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Court would not adjudicate upon foreign disputes not so connected with England. It was a natural refinement of this concept of jurisdiction that if it were inappropriate to decide the case in England and there was a competent tribunal to decide it in the natural foreign forum, the requisites of jurisdiction would be held to be lacking even though there was a connection with England (for example [the] defendant\u2019s residence in England) which in other cases would suffice to found jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery. The reluctance to deal with foreign disputes produced in <i>Doss v. Secretary of State for India</i> [(1874\u201375) LR\u00a019\u00a0Eq 509] a liberal doctrine of <i>forum conveniens</i> which was part of the concept of jurisdiction and which did not depend on a distinction between the existence of jurisdiction and the discretion to exercise it. <i>On the passing of the Judicature Act 1873 the principles on which the Court of Chancery and the Courts of Law exercised jurisdiction were different. The Judicature Act 1873 did not itself resolve this difference, but it would have been manifestly inconvenient if the English Court had exercised jurisdiction on principles which varied according to whether the cause of action was legal or equitable. The problem was resolved in favour of the common law principles without discussion.</i></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Since the Judicature Act 1873 it has been uniformly held that mere presence suffices to found jurisdiction. None of the English cases has concerned an equitable cause of action. Nonetheless they have been decided in the belief that the principle of jurisdiction based on mere presence is a fundamental rule that applies to the entire jurisdiction of the English High Court.</span></i> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">...</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, in England, <i>post</i>-1873, the jurisdiction of the courts of common law and that of the courts of equity were placed on an equal basis. Presence, submission or service of a writ or other originating process out of jurisdiction in accordance with the prevailing civil procedure rules was thenceforth sufficient for the courts to assume jurisdiction. <i>There was no longer any requirement that there had to be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before the court could assume equitable as well as common law jurisdiction.</i> This is also the position in Singapore today (see s\u00a016 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 2007\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d)).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once the court assumes equitable jurisdiction on any of the bases set out in s\u00a016 of the SCJA, it can act <i>in personam</i> against the defendant. The court can consider the personal equities exception and would (provided the exception is established on the facts before it) be free to issue an order which may indirectly affect foreign land. As has been observed in a leading textbook (see Sir\u00a0Peter North &amp; J\u00a0J\u00a0Fawcett, <i>Cheshire and North\u2019s Private International Law</i> (LexisNexis UK, 13th\u00a0Ed, 1999) at p\u00a0377):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The primary essential is that the defendant should be subject to the general jurisdiction of the court. This jurisdiction, as we have seen, is founded on his presence in England, but as regards the power to pronounce a decree in personam against him it is equally well founded by service of a claim form under Order\u00a011 [of the Rules of the Supreme Court (UK)]. Once the court is thus empowered to take cognizance of the matter, the doctrine that equity acts in personam may be freely and effectively applied. A decree may be issued which, though personal in form, will indirectly affect land abroad.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, with respect, the Judge was wrong to require that a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum be established before equitable jurisdiction could be assumed by the court. This represented the position taken by the Court of Chancery <i>prior to</i> 1873, which has long been <i>abandoned</i> even in England itself and which certainly does not represent the position in Singapore today.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should also deal with a related point which was referred to briefly above (at [14]) as this will (as we shall see) aid us in assessing the case law that was relied upon by the Judge in arriving at the conclusion that a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum was required before equitable jurisdiction could be assumed by the court. This point is that the Court of Chancery not only assumed jurisdiction according to a strict rule prior to 1873, but also did so (as White perceptively argues) as the result of a reluctance to apply <i>choice of law</i> rules to the dispute at hand (see White\u2019s article ([13] <i>supra</i>) at 106 and the extracts from Yeo\u2019s book ([13] <i>supra</i>) set out below). With respect, the Court of Chancery\u2019s stance no longer represents the modern approach under which issues of jurisdiction and issues of choice of law are treated by the courts as being conceptually as well as practically distinct. Indeed, as just alluded to, the failure to distinguish between these two distinct issues gives us a clue as to why the case law (in particular, the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Lightning v Lightning Electrical Contractors Limited</i> [1998] EWHC\u00a0Admin 431 (\u201c<i>Lightning</i>\u201d)) <i>appeared</i> to support the Judge\u2019s view that there had to be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before equitable jurisdiction could be assumed by the court. Before we turn our attention briefly to such case law, the following pertinent observation by Prof\u00a0Yeo should be noted (see Yeo\u2019s book at para\u00a01.19):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">While there may have been a historical link between jurisdiction and choice of law in the Chancery court, <i>in the modern context there is insufficient justification for linking jurisdiction and choice of law for equitable doctrines</i> \u2026 [emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The learned author proceeded to give six persuasive reasons for the above observation, including the following (<i>id</i> at paras\u00a01.23 and 1.25):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1.23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... [T]he historical context is important. In tracing the historical development of English conflict of laws, Sack [A\u00a0N\u00a0Sack, \u201cConflict of Laws in the History of the English Law\u201d in <i>Law: A Century of Progress 1835\u22121935</i> (A\u00a0Reppy ed) (Oxford University Press, 1937) vol\u00a03 at p\u00a0342] noted the widespread use of jurisdiction as an early technique to limit the application of the law of the forum, <i>before</i> choice of law rules were developed. The <i>underdeveloped</i> rules for choice of law in respect of equitable doctrines must be borne in mind when considering the practice of the eighteenth-century courts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u2026</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1.25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... [C]hanges of jurisdiction rules brought about by the Judicature Act 1873 put the jurisdiction of the courts of common law and equity <i>on an equal basis</i>. The broad bases upon which jurisdiction can be assumed today make application of the law of the forum even more unreasonable. Any slender links that existed between the Chancery court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction and the question of choice of law have <i>now been broken</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In this regard, we must respectfully disagree with the English High Court decision of <i>R\u00a0Griggs Group Ltd v Evans</i> [2005] Ch 153 in so far as it suggests (especially at [110]) that the personal equities exception to the <i>Mo\u00e7ambique</i> rule is one which relates to choice of law instead of jurisdiction, although it might be argued that the learned judge in that case was involved <i>only</i> in a choice of law analysis (as opposed to the issue of jurisdiction).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turning, now, to <i>Lightning</i>, the Judge, with respect, relied wrongly on this case as support for his view that there had to be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before the court could assume equitable jurisdiction. In <i>Lightning</i>, the court assumed equitable jurisdiction and applied English law to determine a trust claim to Scottish property. While the facts of that case disclosed, in <i>fact</i>, a close connection between the dispute and the forum, such a connection went only to the choice of law analysis and <i>not</i> to the issue of jurisdiction. The crucial passage in the judgment of Peter Gibson\u00a0LJ (with whom Henry and Millett\u00a0LJJ agreed) occurs at [23], and reads as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Mr\u00a0Lord [counsel for the defendant] said that these authorities [<i>ie</i>, the authorities considered at [18]\u2013[22] of <i>Lightning</i>] go only to the question of jurisdiction and do not go to the question of the applicable law. But, for my part, whilst that may be correct, it seems to me implicit that the English court not unnaturally regarded English law as applicable to the relationship between the parties before it in the absence of any event governed by the lex situs destructive of the equitable interest being asserted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We can, in fact, do no better than to adopt Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s perceptive observations on <i>Lightning</i> in general and the observations of Peter Gibson\u00a0LJ (<i>id</i> at [23]) in particular, as follows (see Yeo\u2019s book ([13] <i>supra</i>) at para 1.17):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Moreover, just because a court applied English law <b><i>after assuming jurisdiction</i></b> does not mean that it follows as a matter of law that English law was applicable. In <i>Lightning v Lightning Electrical Contractors Ltd</i>, Peter Gibson\u00a0LJ, said of the jurisdiction cases:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Counsel] said that these authorities go only to the question of jurisdiction and do not go to the question of the applicable law. But, \u2026 whilst that may be correct, it seems to me implicit that <i>the English court not unnaturally regarded English law as applicable to the relationship between the parties before it</i> in the absence of any event governed by the <i>lex situs</i> destructive of the equitable interest being asserted. (Emphasis added.)</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The emphasized words show <b><i>a separate choice of law analysis</i></b> focusing on the law governing the relationship of the parties, which usually happened to be English law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis added in bold italics]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, this interpretation of <i>Lightning</i> underlies the analysis by another writer who argues that equitable obligations should not automatically be governed by the <i>lex fori</i> as such (see generally Adeline Chong, \u201cThe Common Law Choice of Law Rules for Resulting and Constructive Trusts\u201d (2005) 54\u00a0ICLQ 855 at 863\u2013866).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, the close connection between the dispute and the forum went only to the analysis of choice of law, and not jurisdiction, in <i>Lightning</i>. The same is true of <i>Webb v Webb</i> [1991] 1\u00a0WLR 1410, to which the Judge also referred. Consequently, the lack of a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum is not, in our view, a bar to the assumption of equitable <i>jurisdiction</i> by the court.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><em>Has the appellant\u2019s equity been extinguished by the</em></span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">lex situs<em>?</em></span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we mentioned earlier (at [12] above), the Judge also observed, by way of <i>obiter dicta</i>, that it was arguable that the appellant\u2019s equity had already been extinguished by the <i>lex situs</i>. He was of the view that it was common ground between the parties that the communal property doctrine in Indonesian law was subject to the exception that spouses had full entitlement to properties acquired as gifts. The Judge thus observed that, if the first respondent had received the foreign properties as gifts, she would be fully entitled to those properties under Indonesian law.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With respect, we are unable to agree with these observations.</span> <span lang=\"EN-AU\">Even if the <i>lex situs</i> did apply for the purposes of determining whether the appellant\u2019s equity had been extinguished (which issue we need not decide), no evidence of Indonesian law was adduced in the court below to support the Judge\u2019s finding. The appellant also vehemently denied that it was common ground between the parties that, under Indonesian law, spouses were fully entitled to properties acquired as gifts. As such, although we recognise that the Judge\u2019s comments were strictly <i>obiter</i>, we find that there simply is no basis on the evidence to support these comments.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i></strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next issue that arises for our consideration is whether, although our courts do have jurisdiction over the Claims, we ought nevertheless to decline to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. We have previously stated that the relevant test in this regard is to determine whether there is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore which meets the ends of justice, having regard to the interests of the parties (see the decision of this court in <i>Murakami Takako</i> ([1] <i>supra</i>) at [49]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has been firmly established that the principles laid down in <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation\u00a0v Cansulex Ltd</i> [1987] AC 460 (\u201c<i>Spiliada</i>\u201d) apply (see, for example, the decisions of this court in <i>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT\u00a0Airfast Services Indonesia</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 776</nobr>, <i>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 253</nobr>, <i>PT\u00a0Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Limited</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 49</nobr>, <i>Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 377</nobr> (\u201c<i>Rickshaw</i>\u201d) at [12] and <i>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</i> <nobr>[2008] SGCA 36</nobr> (\u201c<i>CIMB</i>\u201d) at [25]). The principles set out in <i>Spiliada</i> were recently summarised in <i>CIMB</i> (at [26]) as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The gist of these principles is that, under the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, a stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden of establishing this rests on the defendant and it is not enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum. The defendant must also establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. The natural forum is one with which the action has the most real and substantial connection. In this regard, the factors which the court will take into consideration include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court concludes, at this stage of the inquiry (\u201cstage one of the <i>Spiliada</i> test\u201d), that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, at this stage, it concludes that there is some other available forum which <i>prima facie</i> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. In this connection, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case. For this second stage [of the] inquiry (\u201cstage two of the <i>Spiliada</i> test[\u201d]), the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of those special circumstances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the first stage of the analysis delineated in the above passage, the relevant factors are, <i>inter alia</i>, the general connecting factors and the choice of law (see <i>Rickshaw</i> at [15]). In the court below, the Judge was of the view that, as there was (in his view) a requirement that there be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before the court could assume equitable jurisdiction, the <i>lex fori</i> (here, Singapore law) ought to apply \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that the decision of this court in <i>Eng Liat Kiang</i> ([9] <i>supra</i>) appeared to be authority to the contrary (see the GD at [39]\u2013[40]). He nevertheless proceeded to hold that, in the light of the decision of this court in <i>Rickshaw</i>, the application of the <i>lex fori</i> in the context of the present proceedings would be unsuitable (see the GD at [41]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have, in fact, held above (at [18] and [22]) that there need not be a sufficient connection between the dispute and the forum before the court can assume equitable jurisdiction. In any event, we have also held above (at [19]) that the issue of jurisdiction is separate and distinct from that relating to the choice of law. More importantly, as Prof\u00a0Yeo has very persuasively argued, the court can still proceed to engage in a choice of law analysis and apply a law other than the <i>lex fori</i> even after it has assumed equitable jurisdiction. We have previously endorsed Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s view in <i>Rickshaw</i>, as follows (<i>id</i> at [75]\u2013[76]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We note, at the outset, that the principles relating to choice of law with regard to claims in equity are not entirely clear. We are therefore especially grateful to have the benefit of the views of the leading expert in the field in Singapore (and, indeed, the Commonwealth) as embodied in a very scholarly volume which, if we may say so, has justly received widespread praise: see T\u00a0M\u00a0Yeo, <i>Choice of Law for Equitable Doctrines</i> (Oxford University Press, 2004) (\u201c<i>Yeo</i>\u201d). Indeed, this is the seminal work in the field in the Commonwealth and is based on the author\u2019s doctoral thesis completed at Oxford University (a summary of his main theses can be found in Tiong Min Yeo, \u201cChoice of Law for Equity\u201d in ch\u00a07 of <i>Equity in Commercial Law</i> (Simone Degeling &amp; James Edelman eds) (Law Book Co, 2005)). There is in fact little by way of direct authority in this particular area of the law and the learned author does rely much on first principles. His views are therefore especially valuable in the circumstances.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It used to be thought that the <i>lex causae</i> for claims in equity would generally be the <i>lex fori</i> (in these proceedings, Singapore law). The central insight of Prof\u00a0Yeo\u2019s book (referred to in the preceding paragraph) is the suggestion of a more nuanced approach. Put simply, there would not, <i>ipso facto</i>, be an automatic and blanket application of the <i>lex fori</i> in any and every situation of this nature. Instead, the nature and origins of the equitable obligations concerned would need to be closely examined in the context of their respective factual matrices. In our view, such an approach is undoubtedly sound. The adoption of the <i>lex fori</i> as the <i>lex causae</i> for <i>all</i> issues arising in equity would fail to recognise the disparate doctrines and causes of action arising in equity. Such an approach would be no different from a suggestion that all common law claims, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, should be governed by the <i>lex fori</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[emphasis in original]</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We also noted above (at [27]) that the Judge had, in any event, followed the above approach in <i>Rickshaw</i>.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In these proceedings, the viability or otherwise of the Claims ultimately rests on whether or not the Testator had an interest in the foreign immovable properties as well as the other foreign properties (collectively referred to as \u201cthe disputed foreign properties\u201d), and this falls to be determined by the Testator\u2019s <i>lex domicilii</i>, which was Indonesian law. The question that arises for our consideration then is whether, given that the <i>lex causae</i> is Indonesian law, Indonesia is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore for the adjudication of the Claims.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant\u2019s claim that the Testator had an interest in the entire share of the disputed foreign properties requires the court to consider whether, under Indonesian law, those properties were excepted from being regarded as common marital assets such that the Testator had full entitlement to them. The matter is further complicated by the first respondent\u2019s counter-allegation that, on the contrary, she was fully entitled to the disputed foreign properties as gifts. These are issues which require a careful consideration of the scope of the communal property doctrine in Indonesian law. In addition, the appellant has also alleged a failure on the part of the first respondent to disclose to the Indonesian courts the disputed foreign properties as marital assets. The effect of such non-disclosure may or may not bring with it certain legal consequences under Indonesian law. In sum, the complexities raised by the Claims are, in our view, better dealt with by the Indonesian courts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are also other general connecting factors pointing to Indonesia as the clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum. Both the Testator and the first respondent were resident and married in Indonesia, and the present dispute arose out of ancillary proceedings in a divorce action commenced there as well. Further, the appellant had previously brought a claim relating to those of the disputed foreign properties situated in Indonesia (\u201cthe Indonesian properties\u201d) before the South Jakarta District Court. Her prior claim was dismissed merely on the ground of procedural defects (see <i>Takako Murakami v Louise Maria Wiryadi</i> Judgment No\u00a0924/Pdt.G/2006/PN.Jak.Sel. (3\u00a0October 2007) (unreported)). In particular, she failed to include, as parties to the action, the third parties in whose names the Indonesian properties were registered. Since the appellant\u2019s claim to the Indonesian properties has yet to be adjudicated on its merits, the appellant is not precluded from bringing another claim in Indonesia to those properties.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In so far as those of the disputed foreign properties situated in Australia (\u201cthe Australian properties\u201d) are concerned, the appellant also previously brought claims in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Gzell\u00a0J, in <i>Murakami v Wiryadi</i> <nobr>[2006] NSWSC 1354</nobr> (\u201c<i>Murakami</i>\u201d), stayed those proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. The learned judge applied the Australian approach to <i>forum non conveniens</i> as set out in the Australian High Court decisions of <i>Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay</i> (1988) 165\u00a0CLR 197 (\u201c<i>Oceanic Sun Line</i>\u201d), <i>Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited</i> (1990) 171\u00a0CLR 538 (\u201c<i>Voth</i>\u201d), <i>Henry v Henry</i> (1996) 185\u00a0CLR 571 and <i>CSR Limited v Cigna Insurance Australia Limited</i> (1997) 189\u00a0CLR 345 to the effect that the court may stay or dismiss proceedings if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the availability of the foreign tribunal, the forum is clearly inappropriate for the determination of the dispute (reference may similarly be made to the (also) Australian High Court decision of <i>Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang</i> (2002) 210\u00a0CLR 491).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the test applied in the Australian context to the issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is quite different from that set out in <i>Spiliada</i> ([26] <i>supra</i>), there would (on most occasions) be no difference in the actual result arrived at by the court (see, for example, <i>Oceanic Sun Line</i> at 251\u2013252 (<i>per</i> Deane\u00a0J) and 265\u2013266 (<i>per</i> Gaudron\u00a0J), <i>Voth</i> at 558 (<i>per</i> Mason\u00a0CJ and Deane, Dawson and Gaudron\u00a0JJ), <i>Eng Liat Kiang</i> ([9] <i>supra</i>) at 104, [23] and Peter Brereton, \u201c<i>Forum Non Conveniens</i> in Australia: A Case Note on <i>Voth</i> v. <i>Manildra Flour Mills</i>\u201d (1991) 40\u00a0ICLQ 895 at 897\u2013898; <i>cf</i>, however, <i>Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments</i> ([6] <i>supra</i>) at para\u00a04.20 (reference may also be made to Richard Garnett, \u201cStay of Proceedings in Australia: A \u2018Clearly Inappropriate\u2019 Test?\u201d (1999) 23\u00a0Melb\u00a0Univ\u00a0L\u00a0Rev 30)). That having been said, it is important to guard against simply equating the two tests because (if nothing else) their respective points of emphasis are quite different (see, for example, <i>Voth</i> at 558 <i>per</i> Mason\u00a0CJ and Deane, Dawson and Gaudron\u00a0JJ; the learned judges, however, also observed that, in applying the test under Australian law, \u201cthe discussion by Lord\u00a0Goff in <i>Spiliada</i> of relevant \u2018connecting factors\u2019 and \u2018a legitimate personal or juridical advantage\u2019 provide[d] valuable assistance\u201d (<i>id</i> at 564\u2013565) \u2013 observations which were also cited and applied by Gzell\u00a0J in <i>Murakami</i> at [39]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While we have previously rejected the Australian approach to <i>forum non conveniens</i> in favour of the test in <i>Spiliada</i>, which calls for a determination of whether there is another forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore (see, for example, the decision of this court in <i>Eng Liat Kiang</i> at 105, [26]), Gzell\u00a0J\u2019s observations in <i>Murakami</i> ([32] <i>supra</i>) are nevertheless helpful. This is because the factors which the learned judge considered would apply with equal force in the context of the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> as set out in <i>Spiliada</i>. In particular, Gzell\u00a0J noted that (see <i>Murakami</i> at [45]):</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The connecting factors ... do not favour New South Wales against Indonesia. [The appellant] is not resident in New South Wales and [the first respondent] and [the fourth respondent] do not live in Australia. The events [which are] the subject of complaint are just as much centred in Indonesia where the non-disclosure of the New South Wales assets is alleged to have occurred as in New South Wales where the assets were acquired.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The learned judge also noted (<i>id</i> at [46]), just as we have (see [29] above), that the <i>lex causae</i> was Indonesian law. He further commented (at [47] of <i>Murakami</i>) that:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-quote-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">If matters are to be determined in the New South Wales court expert evidence will be required. If the issues are to be determined in the Indonesian courts there is no need for experts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, Gzell\u00a0J was of the view (<i>id</i> at [52]) that \u201cit [was] in the interests of the parties that a proper resolution of the issues be made in proceedings to be commenced in Indonesia\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The factors and the arguments considered by Gzell\u00a0J in the preceding paragraph, although analysed in the context of the Australian approach to <i>forum non conveniens</i>, apply equally in the context of the approach of this court as embodied in <i>Spiliada</i> ([26] <i>supra</i>). Indeed, there is a considerable overlap between the factors and the arguments considered by Gzell\u00a0J in <i>Murakami</i> and those discussed above in the context of the present proceedings. There is, in fact, good reason to believe that this is one instance where there would be no difference in result regardless of whether the Australian approach or the approach in <i>Spiliada</i> is adopted (see also above at [33]).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the point of enforceability of judgments, we also note that, if indeed the appellant obtains a favourable judgment in Indonesia, the judgment would undoubtedly be enforceable with regard to the Indonesian properties. As for the Australian properties, an Indonesian judgment is also likely to be enforceable in Australia, given Gzell\u00a0J\u2019s recognition that it is appropriate for the Indonesian courts to address the appellant\u2019s claim. These are important practical considerations which we cannot ignore.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, the general connecting factors and the choice of law considerations point to Indonesia as constituting the clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum (as compared to Singapore) for the trial of the issues concerned. For that reason, although our courts have jurisdiction over the Claims, we should not exercise jurisdiction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Based, therefore, on the conclusion which we have arrived at with regard to the issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, we dismiss the appeal with costs and affirm the Judge\u2019s decision to disallow the appellant\u2019s application to include the Claims in her statement of claim. The usual consequential orders are to follow.</span></p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We now give the grounds for our decision with respect to this particular variation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The factual background</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"/>3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The salient facts in relation to this particular issue were straightforward. The wife (who was the petitioner) and the husband were married on 23\u00a0August 1974. The wife petitioned for divorce on the ground of unreasonable behaviour on 23\u00a0November 2005; a <em>decree nisi</em> was granted in favour of the wife on 2\u00a0June 2006. Put simply, this was a long marriage which had lasted some 32\u00a0years. Indeed, the marriage broke down only some time in 2004.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"/>4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were two\u00a0children, born in 1978 and 1985, respectively. However, the more relevant fact in the context of the present appeal was that there were also two\u00a0properties \u2013 the first situated at 2, Marine Vista #18-73, Neptune Court, Singapore\u00a0449026 (\u201cthe Neptune Court property\u201d) and the second situated at 17A, Sennett Road, Singapore\u00a0466797 (\u201cthe Sennett Road property\u201d). The Neptune Court property was purchased in November 1980, in the parties\u2019 joint names, for $55,450. The monthly mortgage instalment and conservancy charges were deducted solely from the husband\u2019s salary between 1980 and 1992. The parties moved into the Neptune Court property in 1983. Prior to moving into the Neptune Court property in 1983, the parties stayed with the husband\u2019s parents and other family members. In August 1992, the parties purchased the Sennett Road property for $775,000. The husband and wife contributed $253,000 and $164,000, respectively, towards the purchase price. The stamp and legal fees were paid for by the husband. To part-finance the rest of the purchase price, the husband obtained a loan of $308,000 under the Government Officers\u2019 Housing Loan scheme and also borrowed a further $60,000 from his mother. The monthly mortgage instalment of $2,849 was serviced by $1,289 and $828 from the husband\u2019s and the wife\u2019s CPF contributions, respectively. The balance of $732 was deducted directly from the husband\u2019s salary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"/>5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also apposite to note that, during the course of their marriage, the parties had managed their family finances by way of a joint account, opened with United Overseas Bank Ltd (\u201cthe joint account\u201d). Both the husband and wife deposited their respective monthly incomes into this joint account before withdrawals were made, whenever appropriate and as agreed, for personal and household expenses. After the purchase of the Sennett Road property, the Neptune Court property was rented out and the rent received was also, in the main, deposited into the joint account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"/>6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Judge ordered that the Neptune Court property be sold within 180\u00a0days of her order and that the sale proceeds (less sale and incidental expenses) be apportioned in the ratio of 20% in favour of the wife and 80% in favour of the husband. In respect of the Sennett Road property, the Judge ordered that it be sold within 12\u00a0months of the date of her order and that the sale proceeds (less sale and incidental expenses) be apportioned in the ratio of 40% in favour of the wife and 60% in favour of the husband.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"/>7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We varied the order in respect of the Neptune Court property and ordered that the sale proceeds (less sale and incidental expenses) be apportioned in the ratio of 40% in favour of the wife and 60% in favour of the husband instead. In the circumstances (and as already mentioned above), we will only deal with the reasons for this variation. Before proceeding to do so, it would be appropriate to set out the Judge\u2019s reasons as to why she arrived at her respective decisions with regard to the division of both the Neptune Court property as well as the Sennett Road property.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"/>8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning, first, to <em>the Neptune Court property</em>, this particular property was apportioned in the ratio of 20% in favour of the wife and 80% in favour of the husband; in this context, the following paragraphs in the GD are apposite (see the GD at [61]\u2212 [62]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wife had admitted that the husband paid from his salary a monthly sum of $366 to service the mortgage of [the Neptune Court property] since 1980. That being the case, it meant the husband had paid, by July 1992, a total sum of $55,266 towards the purchase price of $55,450. In addition, the monthly conservancy charges of the flat were also deducted from his salary until his retirement. Consequently, <em>the wife\u2019s claim that she contributed towards the purchase price was not only unsubstantiated but contradicted the documentary evidence before the court. If she was working as a social welfare officer for 5\u00bd\u00a0days a week, the wife could not possibly have contributed indirectly towards the purchase of the flat by being a homemaker and caregiver of the children, more so, when by her own admission, she did no housework when she lived with the husband\u2019s parents and when she moved to the flat later, as maids were employed</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even so, I awarded the wife a 20% share in the flat taking into consideration that the husband had sometimes not deposited the rental of [the Neptune Court property] into the joint account and he had used some monies in the joint account to pay the property tax of the mother\u2019s flat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"/>9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There appear to have been two main reasons why the Judge allocated the shares in the Neptune Court property in the ratio she did. The first \u2013 hinging on <em>direct</em> contributions \u2212 is based on the fact that it was the <em>husband</em> who had contributed <em>wholly</em> to the purchase price of that property. The second reason, in contrast, focused on <em>indirect</em> contributions by the wife \u2013 or, more accurately, the seeming lack or absence thereof. Indeed, a close perusal of the GD at [61] (reproduced in the preceding paragraph) reveals clearly that the Judge thought that the wife had <em>not</em> made <em>any</em> indirect contributions whatsoever. With respect, we did not find both of these reasons persuasive for the reasons elaborated upon below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"/>10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning, next, to <em>the Sennett Road property</em>, the following paragraph in the GD contains the reasons as to why the Judge allocated the shares in that property in the ratio she did (see the GD at [65]):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In relation to [the Sennett Road property], the husband\u2019s direct monetary contribution was almost twice that of the wife due to his higher salary and correspondingly higher CPF savings and monthly contributions utilised in the purchase. To recapitulate, the husband\u2019s initial payment using his CPF withdrawals was $253,000 as against the wife\u2019s $164,000 (61% to her 39%) while the husband paid on the monthly mortgage instalments in cash and CPF deductions $2,117 as against the wife\u2019s $828 from her CPF contribution. Her percentage was again 39% of his contributions. Consequently, the unequal monetary contributions of the parties (even when the mortgage was redeemed) had to be and was reflected in the 60:40 division I made in favour of the husband and the wife. <em>As with</em> [the Neptune Court property]<em>, the wife\u2019s alleged indirect contribution was more fiction than real; she was working as a full time civil servant since the time the property was acquired and could not have made any significant indirect contributions as a result</em>. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"/>11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There appeared \u2013 from the quotation in the preceding paragraph \u2013 to be one main reason which had two mirror images, so to speak. To elaborate, consistent with her finding with regard to the Neptune Court property, the Judge was of the view that the wife had made <em>no indirect</em> contributions to the marriage whatsoever and that, in the circumstances, the Sennett Road property ought to be divided having regard <em>solely</em> to the parties\u2019 <em>direct financial</em> contributions. With respect, and consistent with our decision on what was basically the same issue in respect of the Neptune Court property, we were unable to agree that the wife had made no indirect contributions to the marriage for reasons which we will elaborate upon below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Our decision</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"/>12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Addressing the <em>first</em> reason given by the Judge in respect of the Neptune Court property, counsel for the wife, Mr\u00a0Randolph Khoo (\u201cMr\u00a0Khoo\u201d), submitted that there had in fact been some direct financial contributions by the wife towards the purchase price of the Neptune Court property. In particular, he pointed to at least two cheques drawn on the joint account on the date that the Neptune Court property was redeemed. Indeed, the documentary evidence did show that, as at 19\u00a0October 1992, a redemption amount of $28,502.79 was still due and payable. Hence, the Judge was, with respect, mistaken in assuming that the husband had been regularly and faithfully paying a monthly sum of $366 since 1980 to service the entire mortgage. Nevertheless, nothing turns on this point as the relevant documentary evidence also revealed that the redemption moneys were not drawn from the joint account, as asserted by Mr\u00a0Khoo, but from the husband\u2019s private bank account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"/>13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even so, Mr\u00a0Khoo was not wrong in submitting that there had in fact been direct financial contributions by the wife, albeit for reasons other than the one he had argued. Generally, we note that, throughout the marriage, both parties\u2019 salaries were deposited into the joint account. Bills were then paid from moneys withdrawn from the joint account. That this was true was not disputed by either party. In fact, the payment of mortgage instalments and conservancy charges for the Neptune Court property was an anomaly in that such payment was first deducted from the husband\u2019s salary before the rest of his salary was credited into the joint account. This specific departure from the usual financial system devised by the parties does not, however, detract from the fact that, in essence, both income and liabilities were treated as an aggregate (and, more importantly, integrated) whole by both parties, without distinction or regard as to who earned what and who was to pay for what items. It was merely a matter of practicality and convenience that the husband, and not the wife, was to pay the above-mentioned mortgage instalments as well as conservancy charges. That being the case, it cannot be gainsaid that the wife <em>had</em> made <em>direct</em> financial contributions to the payment of all property and services purchased by the parties, including the Neptune Court property, by contributing to the joint account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"/>14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, the husband himself inadvertently admitted, in his Second Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 15\u00a0November 2007,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a id=\"Ftn_1_1\" href=\"#Ftn_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> that moneys in the joint account were used to pay for, <em>inter alia</em>, the property tax due on the Neptune Court property. Hence, on this count alone and (indeed) on the strength of the husband\u2019s own testimony, there had been <em>some</em> direct financial contribution by the wife to the purchase of the Neptune Court property, <em>viz</em>, the payment of property tax.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"/>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We summarise. Both husband and wife had, for the better part of their marriage conceived a system in which it mattered not how or how much each party contributed to the family\u2019s finances. In the circumstances, it was disingenuous for the husband to claim, post-marriage, that he had paid wholly for the Neptune Court property. Such a claim is not borne out by the general financial ethos which the parties had accepted (as well as implemented) for the greater duration of the marriage. In any case, as we have just noted, the husband\u2019s own testimony that moneys in the joint account were used to pay for property tax in relation to the Neptune Court property renders his claim unsustainable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"/>16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the <em>second</em> reason given by the Judge in respect of the Neptune Court property (<em>viz</em>, that the wife had <em>not</em> made <em>any indirect</em> contributions at all), we were of the view that this was <em>not</em> in fact the case. The evidence before us did not suggest that the wife had been derelict in her duties towards the family. Counsel for the husband, Ms\u00a0Goh Siok Leng (\u201cMs\u00a0Goh\u201d), argued that the husband\u2019s indirect contributions nevertheless \u201ccancelled out\u201d the wife\u2019s indirect contributions. However, even assuming that that was the case, this did not address directly this second reason, the underlying premise of which was that the wife had <em>not</em> made any <em>indirect</em> contributions to the marriage <em>at all</em>. In this regard, Ms\u00a0Goh argued, further, that this was not, in fact, the finding of the Judge; in particular, she argued that the Judge had in fact held that the wife had made some indirect contributions, but that these were not \u201csignificant\u201d. Ms\u00a0Goh was, in fact, referring to that part of the GD in which the Judge dealt with the Sennett Road property (see the GD at [65], which has been reproduced above at <a href=\"#p1_10\">[10]</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"/>17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst it is true that the Judge did utilise the word \u201csignificant\u201d, this must be balanced against the reference in that very same sentence to the fact that the wife\u2019s indirect contributions were not only \u201calleged\u201d but were (and more importantly) \u201cmore fiction than real\u201d. And, as we have already noted with regard to her observations <em>vis-\u00e0-vis</em> the Neptune Court property, the clear language of the Judge\u2019s decision pointed towards a finding of <em>no indirect contributions whatsoever</em>. It should, in this regard, also be borne in mind that the Judge\u2019s observations with regard to <em>both</em> the Neptune Court property and the Sennett Road property <em>must necessarily be read together</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"/>18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The issue that then arises is whether or not there was indeed any evidence which demonstrated that the wife had made no indirect contributions whatsoever to the marriage. As is evident from the Judge\u2019s observations reproduced above (at <a href=\"#p1_8\">[8]</a> and <a href=\"#p1_10\">[10]</a>), her principal reason for arriving at such a conclusion was that the wife had been a full-time civil servant who had left the running of the household to domestic help. With respect, we are unable to accept this reason. Many married couples are in precisely such a situation. However, it does not necessarily follow that the husband and/or the wife would thereby be unable to contribute indirectly towards the marriage in general and the family in particular. In this regard, we endorse the following observations by Tay Yong Kwang\u00a0JC in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Lee Chung Meng Joseph v Krygsman</em> <nobr>[2001] 1 SLR 579</nobr> at [22] and [41]:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insofar as indirect contributions were concerned, the wife claimed that she had looked after the husband, their son and the home and performed various household chores. The husband retorted that they had a maid since the birth of their son who was looking after the household needs. He claimed that the wife only brought their son out or spent her time with friends. He allowed the wife\u2019s mother, who was suffering from mental illness, to live with them for four to five years before she passed away. He also brought the mother and the wife\u2019s sister to hospital frequently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">\u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether the wife was the main care-giver was an inference that the judge could rightly draw from the evidence before her. <em>Having a maid in the household, or a number of maids for that matter, does not mean abdication of parental responsibility towards the child</em>. Further, as accepted by the husband\u2019s counsel, housing agents like the wife do have rather greater flexibility in their working hours. They could also have a choice in where they work, even from home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Although Ms\u00a0Goh sought to argue that the wife in that case had a job with greater flexibility in working hours, this was a further (and fact-specific) reason and does not detract from the <em>general principle</em> enunciated by the learned judge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"/>19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the acceptance of a contrary proposition must presuppose that spouses who work full-time cannot, <em>ipso facto</em>, spare any time to contribute towards the marriage or the family at all and would necessarily have to sacrifice their all (and, consequently, their marriage as well as family) at the altar of work. Whilst obviously undesirable, this is not to state that such a situation is impossible. However, this would have to be established by cogent evidence. It was clear that such evidence was <em>not</em> forthcoming in the present appeal. Put simply, there was nothing in the evidence before us which suggested that the wife had, in fact, sacrificed herself as well as her family and marriage at the altar of work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"/>20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, for all intents and purposes, this was a long marriage which only broke down towards the end. In fact, for the better part of 32\u00a0years, this marriage could be described as a successful one. This point alone militates against a finding that either party did not contribute towards the well-being of the family. Although there can, of course, be exceptional cases, for a couple to successfully raise and establish a family (as the parties did in the instant case), both husband and wife must contribute, albeit often in unequal proportions, towards the non-financial needs and requirements of the marriage and the family. The evidence in the present case bears testimony to the correctness of this proposition. Whilst it might have been true that the wife might have contributed relatively less towards the welfare of the family for the period from 1974 to 1983 (when the family resided with the husband\u2019s parents), we are of the view that the situation was quite different following the family\u2019s move to the Neptune Court apartment. From then onwards, the wife had to, <em>inter alia</em>, train, manage and supervise the execution of duties assigned to the maids. The wife, in other words, took on a managerial role in ensuring the smooth running of the household (with all the accompanying logistical requirements). This role is at least as essential and important as the direct performance of the chores itself. Further, it is clear, in our view, that the wife also, when required, personally looked after the needs of the two children. Considering that she managed to do all these while holding down a regular full-time job, the wife should be accorded the credit that is due to her. It is ironic, therefore, that the husband endeavoured to use this last-mentioned fact to assert that the wife had made no indirect contributions to the purchase of the two properties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"/>21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be pointed out that <em>indirect</em> contributions are, by their very nature, not given to easy ascertainment as well as valuation; they contain an inherent as well as irreducible <em>qualitative</em> factor which stands in stark contrast to the <em>quantitative or mathematical</em> nature of <em>direct</em> financial contributions. However, what <em>is</em> clear is that such (indirect) contributions cannot be either gainsaid or undervalued. As this court emphasised in <em>NK v NL</em> <nobr>[2007] 3 SLR 743</nobr> at [34], it is important \u201cto ensure that indirect contributions are <em>not undervalued</em>\u201d [emphasis in original]; indeed, the court reiterated the following proposition laid down in its previous decision of <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> <nobr>[2007] 3 SLR 520</nobr> at [39] (\u201c<em>Lock Yeng Fun</em>\u201d), as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In this regard, we also endorse the following views expressed by Debbie Ong Siew Ling &amp; Valerie Thean, \u201cFamily Law\u201d, (2005) 6\u00a0SAL Ann Rev\u00a0259 at para\u00a013.31:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">It could be contended that in most cases where one party experiences great financial success, the other often bears a heavy burden in respect of the children and home; in some cases this entails the sacrifice of any potential for career development. Non-financial contributions are impossible to measure, and success on that front, intangible and difficult to define. It is hoped that this would not stand in the way of courts according due regard to the fact that the financial aspect is but one facet of the many demands that husband and wife must have weathered if a family has had many years together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Our examination of the case law shows that the courts might not have given sufficient recognition to the value of factors like homemaking, parenting and husbandry when attributing to them a financial value in the division of matrimonial assets. This ought <em>not</em> to be the case. It is true that, by their very nature, such kinds of contributions to the marriage are, as pointed out in the quotation above, difficult to measure because they are, intrinsically, incapable of being measured in precise financial terms (we assume that this is what the authors meant when they said that such contributions were impossible to measure). Difficulty in measuring the financial value of such contributions has never been \u2013 and ought never to be \u2013 an obstacle to giving the spouse concerned his or her just and equitable share of the matrimonial assets that is commensurate with his or her contributions, taking into account (of course) the other relevant contributions and factors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"/>22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the circumstances, it followed that we were also unable to accept the Judge\u2019s finding that the wife had made no indirect contributions to the marriage <em>vis-\u00e0-vis</em> the Sennett Road property, which finding was (as we have seen above at <a href=\"#p1_10\">[10]</a>) the main reason for the division arrived at by the Judge in respect of that particular property. We pause to observe that it is essential in appropriate cases (such as this) to give effect to the spirit behind the amendments, made in 1996, to provisions in the Act relating to the division of matrimonial assets and which are presently embodied in s\u00a0112 of the Act; in particular, the following observations by the Minister for Community Development, Mr\u00a0Abdullah Tarmugi, during the Second Reading of the Women\u2019s Charter (Amendment) Bill, are particularly apposite (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (2\u00a0May 1996) vol\u00a066 at col\u00a091):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[T]he new provisions will in fact benefit rather than put women at a disadvantage. The proposed provisions will not put a woman, who is a full-time home-maker or a working and contributing party, in a worse off position. It will not. <em>In fact, a working and contributing woman will be better off under the proposed amendments, as the courts can now also take into consideration her home-making efforts, regardless of the extent of her contribution to the assets</em>. This would provide for <em>a fairer</em> distribution of assets than the current provisions. [emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"/>23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In arriving at our decision as to what was a \u201cjust and equitable\u201d division of both the Neptune Court property as well as the Sennett Road property pursuant to s\u00a0112(1) of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap\u00a0353, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), we bore in mind, in particular, the following principles. The first centred on the fact that the division of matrimonial assets under s\u00a0112 of the Act is not \u2013 and cannot be \u2013 a precise mathematical exercise and that the court\u2019s discretion is to be exercised in broad strokes instead (see, for example, the decision of this court in <em>Lock Yeng Fun</em> (<a href=\"#p1_21\">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [33]\u2013 [35]); indeed, as this court pointed out, in <em>NK v NL</em> (<a href=\"#p1_21\">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [28], \u201cit is essential that courts resist the temptation to lapse into a minute scrutiny of the conduct and efforts of both spouses, which may be objectionable in disadvantaging the spouse whose efforts are difficult to evaluate in financial terms\u201d. In this regard, it was also pointed out in <em>NK v NL</em> (at [22]\u2013 [27]), that <em>direct</em> financial contributions are <em>not</em> to be considered as a <em>prima facie</em> starting point although they nevertheless constitute a factor which should be considered by the court pursuant to the exercise of its discretion under s\u00a0112 of the Act (which involves what is essentially a multi-factorial approach). We have also referred to the need to ensure that <em>indirect</em> contributions are also accorded due recognition (see <a href=\"#p1_21\">[21]</a> above).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"/>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr\u00a0Khoo had also argued that both properties be divided equally between the parties. However, he did not seek to premise his argument on the proposition that an equal division of matrimonial assets should be the starting point or presumption or norm; in any event, such a proposition has been rejected by this court for the reasons set out in <em>Lock Yeng Fun</em> (<a href=\"#p1_21\">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [50]\u2013 [57].</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"/>25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bearing the above principles in mind, we were of the view that a \u201cjust and equitable\u201d division of both the Neptune Court property as well as the Sennett Road property pursuant to s\u00a0112(1) of the Act would (having regard to all the circumstances) be in the ratio of 40% to the wife and 60% to the husband. In the circumstances, we varied the order of the court below to reflect this decision (<em>viz</em>, that the Neptune Court property also be apportioned in the ratio of 40% to the wife and 60% to the husband, instead of 20% to the wife and 80% to the husband as the Judge had originally ordered in the court below). In this regard, and by way of recapitulation, we bore in mind, in particular, the fact that the wife <em>had</em> in fact made <em>indirect</em> contributions to the marriage as well as the fact that she had in fact contributed (albeit in a much smaller proportion) towards the <em>direct</em> financing of the Neptune Court property (we pause to observe, parenthetically, that, if these additional reasons were not taken into account, the Judge\u2019s decision with respect to the Neptune Court property would, in fact, have been rather generous). In arriving at our decision, we also bore in mind the <em>husband\u2019s indirect</em> contributions (see also <em>NK v NL</em> (<a href=\"#p1_21\">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [37]) as well as the fact that he had contributed significantly more towards the direct financing of the Sennett Road property.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"/>26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to varying the order of the court below in the manner set out above, we were also of the view (pursuant to the exercise of our power under O\u00a022A r\u00a012 of the Rules of Court (Cap\u00a0322, R\u00a05, 2006 Rev Ed)) that, having regard to the fact that the wife had not accepted an offer to settle from the husband which would have resulted (at the very least) in no less favourable a decision for her than that arrived at in the present appeal as well as the fact that she had succeeded only partially in her appeal, each party should bear their own costs of this appeal, with the usual consequential orders to follow.</p>\n\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\" size=\"1\"/>\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><sup><a id=\"Ftn_1\" href=\"#Ftn_1_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Respondent\u2019s Supplemental Core Bundle at p 30.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n", "<searchResponse><Copyright>Copyright \u00a9 Government of Singapore.</Copyright><mainContent><html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

When imposing the sentence, the trial judge took into account a second charge against Teo for fabricating false evidence by getting another person, Haidil bin Harun (\u201cHaidil\u201d), to make a false police report, in which Haidil claimed to have been present when the infant was found unconscious and that it was he who put medicated oil on the infant\u2019s tongue. We allowed the appeal against the sentence imposed on Teo and now set out the reasons for our decision.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Teo had been hired as a private investigator by the infant\u2019s mother, Tay Seoh Hong (\u201cTay\u201d), to check on the movements of her husband, whom she suspected of having an affair with another woman. As it turned out, Teo, a married man with children of his own, fell in love with Tay and they became lovers. After Tay separated from her husband, Teo\u2019s mother helped Tay look after the infant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">3<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The tragic event occurred on 25\u00a0October 2000 when Teo had to look after the infant for some time. He first drove to a car park at Serangoon Garden Way as he wanted to buy 4-D tickets. When the infant started crying, he decided to go to another 4-D outlet at Hougang Central. As the infant was still crying, he tried to pacify her by feeding her milk but the infant refused to drink the milk. Teo then applied some \u201cAxe\u201d medicated oil onto the infant\u2019s lips and nostrils. The infant showed signs of discomfort and the accused assumed that she felt a burning sensation on her lips and nostrils after the application of the medicated oil.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> A little later, Teo shouted at the infant when she began to cry again. This time, he poured some of the medicated oil into the infant\u2019s mouth. The infant stopped crying but she moved her tongue in and out of her mouth and groaned in discomfort. Teo then joined the queue at the 4-D outlet at Hougang Central to purchase 4-D tickets. While he was in the queue, the infant started to cry. Teo returned with the infant to his car and tried to feed her milk. When she refused to drink the milk, he applied medicated oil onto her lips and nostrils and proceeded to a petrol kiosk to buy some goods, including a bottle of \u201cAxe\u201d medicated oil because the one that he had was already empty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">5<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Teo next drove to the Riverdale Plaza car park and tried to feed the infant again. When she refused to drink the milk offered to her and cried, he shook the contents of the new bottle of medicated oil into her mouth. The infant\u2019s cries became fainter and fainter, her face changed colour, her stomach became bloated, there was a watery discharge from her nostrils and she retched and tried very hard to get rid of the poisonous substance from her body before she finally became unconscious. Teo took the infant and ran to a medical clinic in the shopping mall. It was then around 5.03pm. An ambulance took the infant to the KK\u00a0Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 6.30pm. Dr\u00a0Wee Keng Poh, a forensic pathologist, certified that the cause of death was \u201cacute salicylic acid poisoning\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Teo pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. His counsel pointed out that Teo had a history of \u201cacute situation reaction\u201d and that he did not intend to kill the infant as he loved her very much. At the material time, he was involved in his own divorce proceedings and was suffering from severe acute stress.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The trial judge, who noted that the court had a discretion to impose a sentence of imprisonment for up to ten years, was of the view that this case warranted a sentence that fell within the mid-range of the specified period of incarceration. He noted that Teo had not used violence on the child and that his apparent motive in using the medicated oil was primarily to stop the child\u2019s incessant crying. As such, he sentenced Teo to a term of imprisonment of four years.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>The appeal</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The Public Prosecutor, who was of the view that Teo\u2019s sentence was manifestly inadequate for his crime, submitted that the trial judge did not give sufficient weight to the following factors:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the vulnerability of the deceased;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the manner in which the offence was committed;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the sentencing trend; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(d)<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the additional charge faced by Teo with respect to the fabrication of false evidence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> As far as the vulnerability of the deceased is concerned, this court reiterated in <i>Purwanti Parji v PP</i> <nobr>[2005] 2 SLR 220</nobr> that the law recognised the need to protect vulnerable and defenseless persons such as the handicapped, incapacitated, elderly and children. We thus agreed that the fact that the deceased was only seven months old was not given sufficient weight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> As for the manner in which the offence was committed, it may be recalled that the hapless infant\u2019s face changed colour, her stomach became bloated, there was a watery discharge from her nostrils and she retched and tried very hard to get rid of the poisonous substance from her body before she finally became unconscious. Admittedly, Teo did not kick or throw the infant onto the floor but feeding the helpless infant medicated oil and causing her so much pain and suffering is not in any way less heinous. Teo had on no less than four occasions applied medicated oil on the lips, nostrils and mouth of the infant whenever she cried. He was fully aware of the fact that the infant felt a burning sensation on her lips and nostrils after he applied it on her on the first occasion and when he poured medicated oil into the infant\u2019s mouth, he could see that she moved her tongue in and out of her mouth and groaned in discomfort. This did not stop him from continuing to put medicated oil on her lips and nostrils and into her mouth until it was too late.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> We accept that where the court has a discretion in sentencing an offender, the sentence meted out in a particular case may vary from that imposed in other cases because of special circumstances. However, in the present case, there was nothing to justify a departure from the range of sentences meted out in other cases involving the death of children, which is more than the four years of imprisonment imposed on Teo. In many of such cases, the accused were, like Teo, also irritated by the wailing of children.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Three such cases may be noted. In the first case, <i>PP v Sumarni bte Pono</i> Criminal Case No\u00a011 of 2001, the mother of a child, aged two years, was so incensed by his crying that she carried him from his mattress, which was on the floor, and lifted him up to the level of her waist before dropping him onto the mattress. She then pulled his ears and knocked his head several times against the mattress. She pleaded guilty to a charge under s\u00a0304(<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">b</i>) of the Penal Code for causing the death of her child and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In the second case, <i>PP v Dwi Arti Samad</i> Criminal Case No\u00a012 of 2000, the accused, a female aged 22 years, was also irritated by the cries of an infant, aged 15 months. She picked him up from his pram and dropped him onto the floor. The child was killed and she pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. She was sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In the third case, <i>PP v Devadass s/o Suppaiyah</i> Criminal Case No\u00a041 of 1997, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s\u00a0304(<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">b</i>) of the Penal Code. He had held a baby, aged three months, by the neck and slapped him hard several times for crying. The baby died after being thrown onto a mattress on the floor. The accused was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> When compared to the sentences imposed in the above three cases, the sentence imposed by the court below in the present case was manifestly inadequate. Furthermore, it ought not be overlooked that in Teo\u2019s case, another charge under s\u00a0193 of the Penal Code of fabricating false evidence must be taken into account. Teo\u2019s attempt to deceive the police and subvert the course of justice by getting another person to take the rap for him was deplorable.

The application was heard by me. Under ss\u00a036(1) and (2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\u00a0322, 1999\u00a0Rev Ed), the application was deemed to have been made in the Court of Appeal. The application was resisted by Marubeni. After hearing arguments, I dismissed the application with costs. I set out below, my reasons.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Reasons</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Projector cited the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Leong Mei Chuan v Chan Teck Hock David</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 17</nobr>. The headnote of that case summarises the facts of the application there as follows:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The appellant wife appealed to a High Court judge-in-chambers against certain orders made by the district judge on matters ancillary to divorce proceedings between her and the respondent husband. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, the appellant applied for leave to amend the notice of appeal to include a prayer for an order concerning certain matrimonial property, specifically, stock options that had vested in the respondent but that had not yet been exercised. This prayer was not included in the original notice of appeal. The judge approximating the application to an application to extend time for the filing of the notice of appeal, applied stringent standards and rejected the application. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">8<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> LP Thean\u00a0JA, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at [21]:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the present case, the notice of appeal was filed timeously. The only question was whether leave should be given to amend that notice. It is true that the amendment sought was not inconsequential; it was of a substantive character. Be that as it may, the relevant considerations surely ought to be whether the opposing party had been given reasonable notice of the amendment and afforded a sufficient opportunity to address the substance of the amendment, and whether the amendment sought is consistent with the pleadings or the points raised below. Short of grave prejudice or hardship to the opposing party that cannot be addressed by an order as to costs, the court should lean in favour of allowing the amendment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In that case, leave to amend was granted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Relying on that passage, Projector submitted that so long as Marubeni could be compensated by costs, an application to amend a notice of appeal should be allowed. The stringent requirements for an application for extension of time to file an appeal, which I would add are well-known, would not apply to an application to amend a notice of appeal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> While I agreed that the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Leong Mei Chuan</i> meant that the stringent requirements for an application for extension of time to file an appeal would not apply to an application to amend a notice of appeal, I did not agree that that decision also meant that so long as a respondent could be compensated by costs, an application to amend should be allowed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Indeed, [15] of Thean\u00a0JA\u2019s judgment stated:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In our opinion, the stringent standards required in an application for extension of time to file an appeal are not absolute and applicable to all cases where an extension of time is sought. In this regard, we respectfully adopt the words of Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) in <i>Costellow v Somerset County Council</i> [1993] 1\u00a0All ER 952, 959; <nobr>[1993] 1 WLR 256</nobr>, 264, and say that the resolution of problems such as the present application for leave to amend a notice of appeal cannot be governed by a single universally applicable rule of thumb. A rigid, mechanistic approach is inappropriate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Yet, Projector was suggesting that I adopt a mechanistic approach. In my view, what the Court of Appeal meant in [21] of Thean\u00a0JA\u2019s judgment was that the fact that a respondent could be compensated by costs was a factor leaning in favour of allowing the amendment. All the relevant facts leading to the application should still be considered even if Marubeni had been given reasonable notice of the amendment and would be afforded a sufficient opportunity to address the substance of the amendment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Mr\u00a0G\u00a0Asokan, a partner in the local firm of solicitors representing Projector, executed two affidavits which were filed in support of the application to amend. Paragraphs\u00a04 and 5 of his first affidavit stated that the notice of appeal did not include the condition imposed by Ang\u00a0J, \u201cas a result of miscommunication within my firm\u201d. However, no elaboration was given and this point was made in Mr\u00a0Werner Tsu\u2019s affidavit filed for Marubeni in response to Mr\u00a0Asokan\u2019s first affidavit. In response, Mr\u00a0Asokan executed his second affidavit. Surprisingly, para\u00a011 thereof stated that Projector believed that sufficient explanation had been given in his first affidavit as to why the condition was not included in the notice of appeal originally. The said para\u00a011 went on to say, \u201c[i]t was a single case of miscommunication in the taking of instructions from clients who are overseas\u201d. There appeared to be a contradiction between what was stated in each of Mr\u00a0Asokan\u2019s two affidavits.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Projector\u2019s counsel explained in arguments before me, that the condition was not overlooked when the notice of appeal was filed. However, upon a further consideration of the matter after it was filed, it was thought that the condition should be included in the notice of appeal as its omission might affect Projector\u2019s arguments on the issues about inquiry as to damages and costs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Marubeni\u2019s counsel then revealed that, as regards para\u00a011 of Mr\u00a0Asokan\u2019s second affidavit, Projector\u2019s solicitors were taking instructions from an English firm of solicitors. The clients who were giving instructions to the local law firm were not lay clients.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> In response, Projector\u2019s counsel acknowledged that there was an English firm of solicitors advising Projector and this English firm had solicitors in Singapore who were instructing his firm <i>ie</i> the local law firm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">18<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It seemed to me that since the local firm was taking instructions from English solicitors in Singapore, para\u00a011 of Mr\u00a0Asokan\u2019s second affidavit which referred to \u201cthe taking of instructions from clients who are overseas\u201d was inaccurate, to put it mildly.

It did not end with the main judgment. After we gave the Court Order, the parties could not agree on a valuer. Hence, on 23\u00a0October 2007, we appointed KPMG Singapore (\u201cKPMG\u201d) as the valuer, on the application of the wife. The husband refused to co-operate with KPMG to provide a valuation as soon as possible. On the wife\u2019s application, we made an order authorising KPMG to investigate the financial records of TFI. We also ordered that the valuation exercise be completed within three months. This was on 14\u00a0November 2008. More than a year later, on 18\u00a0January 2010, KPMG issued its final valuation report. The report stated the value of TFI to be between $2.22m and $2.43m, with a median value of $2.32m.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"4\" pID=\"p1_4\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">After KPMG\u2019s valuation was released, the husband was advised by his solicitors that the methodology used by KPMG was not in accordance with the terms of the Court Order (see <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_2\">[2]</ParaXRef> above). The husband appointed M/s\u00a0Ferrier Hodgson (\u201cFH\u201d) to review and comment on KPMG\u2019s valuation. FH\u2019s opinion at para\u00a02.3.12 of its report dated 12\u00a0February 2010 was that KPMG\u2019s valuation of $2.32m for TFI was too high for the following reasons:</Text>\n        <List level=\"1\" type=\"loweralpha\">\n          <LItem>\n            <Label>(a)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the earnings multiple applied by KPMG was too high;</Text>\n          </LItem>\n          <LItem>\n            <Label>(b)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the control premium was too high;</Text>\n          </LItem>\n          <LItem>\n            <Label>(c)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the discount for lack of marketability was too low;</Text>\n          </LItem>\n          <LItem>\n            <Label>(d)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the net debt figure was too low; and</Text>\n          </LItem>\n          <LItem>\n            <Label>(e)</Label>\n            <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the estimate of earnings was not appropriate.</Text>\n          </LItem>\n        </List>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">The instant applications</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"5\" pID=\"p1_5\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Following from his refusal to accept KPMG\u2019s valuation, the husband invoked the \u201cliberty to apply\u201d clause in the Court Order to dispute the validity of KPMG\u2019s valuation and to seek a revaluation of TFI by way of Summons No\u00a01092 of 2010. The wife, for her part, is applying by way of Summons No\u00a01083 of 2010 to compel the husband to pay her share of the value of TFI as valued by KPMG. There were other prayers but in light of what follows it is not necessary to refer to them.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"6\" pID=\"p1_6\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband\u2019s application to review KPMG\u2019s valuation was based on two main grounds as follows:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_6-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">KPMG had materially departed from the terms of the Court Order in that it should have valued TFI on the basis of its net asset value or liquidation value, and not on a going concern basis as it had done; and</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_6-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">in any case, there were manifest errors in KPMG\u2019s valuation.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In support of his arguments, counsel for the husband, Mr\u00a0N Sreenivasan, referred to a number of authorities, <Emphasis type=\"i\">eg</Emphasis>, <Emphasis type=\"i\">Tan Yeow Khoon and another v Tan Yeow Tat and others</Emphasis> [2003] 3\u00a0SLR(R)\u00a0486; <Emphasis type=\"i\">Riduan bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat and another</Emphasis> [2005] 2\u00a0SLR(R)\u00a0188; <Emphasis type=\"i\">Hoban Steven Maurice Dixon and another v Scanlon Graeme John and others</Emphasis> [2005] 2\u00a0SLR(R)\u00a0632; <Emphasis type=\"i\">Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Pressscrete Engineering Pte Ltd</Emphasis> [2006] 1\u00a0SLR(R)\u00a0634; and <Emphasis type=\"i\">The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</Emphasis> [2009] 2\u00a0SLR(R)\u00a0385. The cases cited concerned experts appointed and instructed by parties and are not directly relevant. But, for present purposes, we accept that, by analogy, a court can intervene if a court-appointed valuer does not act in accordance with his terms of reference, or if his valuation is patently or manifestly in error. This is subject to the caveat that the court will be slow to find that the valuation is in error, since by appointing an expert in the first place it has taken the position that the matter is best left to the expert. On this basis, we turn to the first ground advanced by the husband.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Was KPMG\u2019s valuation a departure from the terms of the Court Order?</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"7\" pID=\"p1_7\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan argued that this court had intended that TFI be valued on a net asset value or liquidation value basis as the Court Order provided for TFI to be put into the pool of matrimonial assets, only if it has a \u201cpositive\u201d value (see <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_2\">[2]</ParaXRef> above).

There is no evidence that TFI (or any of its component companies) could be sold to any third party buyer. Further, in the years 2004 to 2007, TFI\u2019s working capital was in the negative, and this meant that TFI was effectively insolvent, as it was unable to pay its short-term liabilities. Hence, KPMG was wrong to value TFI on a going concern basis. Here, Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan referred to <Emphasis type=\"i\">Jones (M) and Another v Jones (RR) and Another</Emphasis> [1971] 1\u00a0WLR\u00a0840, where the valuer had valued shares in a company on a break-up basis when he should have used a going concern basis. In rejecting the valuation, Ungoed-Thomas J emphasised, at 856, that \u201cif a valuation is erroneous in principle, it is vitiated and cannot be relied upon even though it is not established that the valuation figure is wrong.\u201d</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"10\" pID=\"p1_10\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">To sum up the husband\u2019s case: KPMG\u2019s valuation is outside the terms of the Court Order which contemplated a valuation based on TFI\u2019s net asset or liquidation value, and not based on its value as a going concern. Further, the valuation is also wrong in principle because it is inappropriate for a private company like TFI.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"11\" pID=\"p1_11\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Counsel for the wife, Ms\u00a0Luna Yap, responded to Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan\u2019s arguments on two grounds. First, the Court Order, read with our further order of 23\u00a0October 2007 appointing KPMG as the valuer, stated that KPMG was to \u201cvalue TFI\u201d and not to conduct a forensic investigation of TFI. Secondly, the husband\u2019s solicitors had in their letter dated 29\u00a0May 2008 confirmed (at para\u00a03) as follows:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">For the avoidance of doubts, the valuation by KPMG is NOT to perform a valuation of [the wife\u2019s] ... share in the entities concerned, but to value [TFI] so as to ascertain \u201cthe total overall value of [TFI]\u201d.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This letter was written in response to KPMG\u2019s Letter of Engagement dated 23\u00a0April 2008, which stated (at p\u00a02) that:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">KPMG ... will perform an independent valuation of [TFI] as at the Valuation Date and our duty is owed to [this Court]. Depending on the information made available to us, we shall use the commonly used methodologies to arrive at the value of [TFI] as at the Valuation Date.</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">This Letter of Engagement was subsequently amended before parties signed it, but the above quoted passage on KPMG\u2019s scope of work remained unchanged. It should be noted that, in their letter, the husband\u2019s solicitors did not stipulate any method of valuation. They left it entirely to KPMG to choose the appropriate method. In contrast, KPMG stated in its Letter of Engagement that it would use methodologies commonly used for valuation of companies.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"12\" pID=\"p1_12\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In our judgment, the interpretation given to the Court Order by Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan has no merit. The Court Order did not stipulate any particular methodology to be used. By necessary implication, it left the valuation to the discretion of independent experts, to be exercised on the basis of market practice and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, having regard to the circumstances relevant to private companies such as TFI. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that KPMG\u2019s method of valuation is a departure from the Court Order, unless it can be shown that it is a method which is <Emphasis type=\"i\">wholly inappropriate</Emphasis> for valuing shares of a private company, such as TFI, for the purposes of a division of matrimonial assets. There was no argument to this effect \u2013 as we understood him, Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan only argued that it was <Emphasis type=\"i\">preferable</Emphasis> for KPMG to value TFI based on its net asset or liquidation value; he did not argue that KPMG\u2019s use of the going concern basis was <Emphasis type=\"i\">wholly inappropriate</Emphasis>. In any case, we think that Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan\u2019s arguments, whatever their merits, have been made too late \u2013 the husband should have applied for directions or clarification before KPMG began the valuation process, and certainly before KPMG completed its valuation.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"13\" pID=\"p1_13\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">There was also no expert evidence before us to show that KPMG\u2019s methodology was inappropriate. While FH, the husband\u2019s valuation expert, took the view that KPMG\u2019s methodology was not supported by current literature, it stopped short of saying that the methodology was wrong. Indeed, in a later part of its report (at para\u00a05.6), FH considered KPMG\u2019s methodology to be appropriate:</Text>\n        <Quote level=\"1\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Based on these points, <Emphasis type=\"i\">we consider that the approach adopted by KPMG to be appropriate</Emphasis>. However, because of the persistence of negative earnings, the valuation is heavily reliant on the assumption that earnings will increase in the future. In other words, if earnings (measured by net profits after tax) continued to be negative in the future, then the equity in TFI would have no value on an earnings based approach. Similarly, the lack of asset backing would not provide any value if we assumed an asset based approach. [emphasis added]</Text>\n        </Quote>\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We therefore cannot accept that KPMG\u2019s methodology was so wholly inappropriate for valuing TFI as to amount to a departure from the Court Order requiring our intervention.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Was KPMG\u2019s valuation manifestly wrong?</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"14\" pID=\"p1_14\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan also argued that KPMG\u2019s valuation was manifestly wrong for the following reasons, which were the principal objections made by FH in its report (see <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_4\">[4]</ParaXRef> above):</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_14-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the earnings multiple of 10.47 for TFI was not based on companies that were directly comparable to TFI;</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_14-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the use of a control premium in the range of 20% to 30% was incorrect and distorted the value of TFI;</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(c)\" pID=\"p1_14-p2_c\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the discount on lack of marketability (\u201cDLOM\u201d) of 15% to 20% for TFI was incorrect as it should be higher;</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(d)\" pID=\"p1_14-p2_d\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the net debt of $371,000 as at 31\u00a0December 2006 was inaccurate as there was a sum of $1.56m owing to the husband; and</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(e)\" pID=\"p1_14-p2_e\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">the sum of $320,449.57 was excluded from EBITDA (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).</Text>\n        </Para>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"15\" pID=\"p1_15\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">As mentioned, we agree with Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan that the court may intervene to correct any manifest or patent error in a valuation. However, we do not agree that the \u201cerrors\u201d complained of are errors, much less manifest or patent errors. Take point\u00a0(a), <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, that the earnings multiple of 10.47 was too high because it was not based on companies that are directly comparable to TFI. The four companies used as comparisons are in the same line of business as TFI. Admittedly, they are not in the same situation as TFI \u2013 amongst other things, three are foreign companies, all are public companies and all are much larger than TFI. Some adjustment would therefore be needed when using these companies to determine TFI\u2019s earnings multiple. But the precise adjustment to be made is a matter for KPMG\u2019s expert judgment, and there is no evidence from FH to explain why KPMG\u2019s judgment in this regard was wrong. FH\u2019s main criticism is that the earnings multiple is too high because of TFI\u2019s \u201cpersistence of negative earnings\u201d (see <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_13\">[13]</ParaXRef> above). But KPMG took this into account when reclassifying the historical profit and loss statements of TFI in order to capture its operating and recurring incomes in the form of EBIT (<Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, earnings before interest and tax) and EBITDA. FH has not criticised this procedure.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"16\" pID=\"p1_16\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">With respect to point\u00a0(b), <Emphasis type=\"i\">viz</Emphasis>, that there should be no control premium because this is a court-ordered distribution of matrimonial assets, and not an acquisition, this was not supported by FH who, as mentioned at <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_13\">[13]</ParaXRef> above, considered that KPMG\u2019s method was appropriate. Without hearing FH and KPMG and further expert evidence on this issue, we are unable to say whether KPMG has made an error in applying a control premium. And, in so far as Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan is arguing that a control premium between 20% and 30% was too high, this is only a difference in opinion.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"17\" pID=\"p1_17\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">With respect to point\u00a0(c), Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan argued that the DLOM should be much higher because TFI is a private company, and not a public company. FH\u2019s view is that the DLOM should be between 30% and 50%, rather than between 15% and 20% as given by KPMG. Again, this is merely a difference in opinion on the size of the discount to be applied.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"18\" pID=\"p1_18\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">Point\u00a0(d), <Emphasis type=\"i\">ie</Emphasis>, that KPMG has ignored the debt of $1.56m owing to the husband, is irrelevant \u2013 whether the $1.56m was credited to TFI or the husband, 60% would have to go to the wife under the terms of the Court Order (see <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_2\">[2]</ParaXRef> above).

We are unable to see any error in such a write-back.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"20\" pID=\"p1_20\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the final analysis, Mr\u00a0Sreenivasan has at the most shown some legitimate differences of opinion between experts on the valuation of TFI. This is very far from the level of a manifest or patent error by KPMG which warrants our intervention, and we therefore decline to disturb KPMG\u2019s valuation.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Selecting a value from the range given by KPMG</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"21\" pID=\"p1_21\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We note that KPMG has given a valuation ranging from $2.22m to $2.43m and has suggested the median value of $2.32m as the value for TFI. KPMG did not state any substantive reason for preferring the median value, and the choice seems to be one of convenience. In these circumstances, it is fair to say that KPMG, applying its expert knowledge, can only give the value for TFI within a range, and not down to a precise figure. This is not surprising since valuation is hardly an exact science. More importantly, we are of the view that the court has a residual discretion in determining the precise value of TFI within the range given by KPMG. Since KPMG\u2019s expertise only extended to giving a range for TFI\u2019s value, and not a precise figure, the existence of the discretion does not intrude onto KPMG\u2019s expertise. For the same reason, the exercise of the discretion cannot be governed by any consideration relating to valuation science or method, which has already reached its limits. It falls to be exercised according to the underlying purpose of the valuation, in this case the division of matrimonial assets. On the facts, we are of the view that, since the main judgment has made ample provision for the wife, it is fair for the husband to be given the benefit of any doubt in the valuation of TFI. Accordingly, we would adopt the lower limit of KPMG\u2019s valuation of TFI<Emphasis type=\"i\">, ie</Emphasis>, $2.22m, rather than the median figure of $2.32m. Under the main judgment (see <ParaXRef pIDRef=\"p1_2\">[2]</ParaXRef> above), the wife would be entitled to 60% of this value, amounting to $1.332m.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Heading level=\"1\" align=\"left\">Conclusion</Heading>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"22\" pID=\"p1_22\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">We will now consider how the 60% value of TFI should be paid to the wife. We note that the whole valuation exercise has been considerably delayed; indeed, almost three years have elapsed since the main judgment. We also recall our finding in the main judgment (at [60]) that the husband had undisclosed assets. At the same time, however, we do not think that the wife is in urgent need of funds, whilst the husband may need time to raise cash in order to pay the sum of $1.332m to the wife.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"23\" pID=\"p1_23\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In the result, and balancing the situations of both parties, we make the following orders:</Text>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(a)\" pID=\"p1_23-p2_a\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The husband shall pay to the wife the sum of $1.332m, being 60% of the value of TFI.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Para level=\"2\" no=\"(b)\" pID=\"p1_23-p2_b\" indent=\"none\">\n          <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">The sum of $1.332m shall be paid in four equal instalments of $333,000, with the first instalment to be paid within one month from the date of this judgment, and the remaining instalments on a quarterly basis thereafter.</Text>\n        </Para>\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">To the extent that the parties\u2019 prayers in their respective applications are not addressed by these orders, they are denied.</Text>\n      </Para>\n      <Para level=\"1\" no=\"24\" pID=\"p1_24\" indent=\"none\">\n        <Text indent=\"none\" align=\"left\">In so far as the issue of costs is concerned, we observe, with regret, that the husband\u2019s recalcitrance which we noted in the main judgment does not appear to have changed over time.

The Licence Agreement was governed by Singapore law. Under the Licence Agreement, Insigma was granted a limited licence to use Alstom\u2019s \u201cwet flue gas desulfurisation\u201d technology in China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"/>4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Licence Agreement provided for the arbitration of any disputes between the parties in Art\u00a018(c) (\u201cthe Arbitration Agreement\u201d) which read as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Any and all such disputes shall be finally resolved by arbitration before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce then in effect and the proceedings shall take place in Singapore and the official language shall be English \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"/>5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometime between late 2005 and early 2006, a dispute arose between Insigma and Alstom over the proper basis of calculating the annual royalties payable by Insigma to Alstom under the Licence Agreement. Alstom attempted to resolve the dispute by amicable means but failed. Alstom then sought to refer the dispute to arbitration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>The International Chamber of Commerce arbitration and its withdrawal</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"/>6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 1\u00a0August 2006, Alstom filed a request for arbitration (\u201cRequest\u201d) with the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d) in Paris, under the ICC Rules of Arbitration (1\u00a0January 1998) (\u201cthe ICC Rules\u201d). Alstom claimed, <em>inter alia</em>, unpaid royalties and damages for breach of the Licence Agreement by Insigma. Alstom requested that the arbitral proceedings (\u201cthe ICC Arbitration\u201d) be conducted in Singapore, under the ICC Rules, at the premises of the SIAC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"/>7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 3\u00a0November 2006, Insigma filed its answer and counterclaim (\u201cAnswer\u201d) to Alstom\u2019s Request, disputing, <em>inter alia</em>, the jurisdiction of any arbitral tribunal constituted by the ICC. Insigma contended that the parties had agreed, under the Arbitration Agreement, to submit the dispute to the SIAC and have the SIAC administer the arbitration under the ICC Rules, that Alstom had breached the Arbitration Agreement by invoking the jurisdiction of the ICC, and that the International Court of Arbitration (\u201cthe ICC Court\u201d) should not proceed with the ICC Arbitration. Insigma further stated that the SIAC was able to administer the arbitration under the ICC Rules (and in support of its statement, enclosed a paper prepared by the SIAC on its position in administering international arbitrations, see Sabiha Shiraz, \u201cInterpretation and Execution of Arbitration Agreements: The SIAC Experience\u201d (11\u00a0April 2006)). In its Answer, Insigma also noted that the parties had agreed to arbitration before the SIAC because of its lower administration costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"/>8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 13\u00a0November 2006, <em>before</em> the Tribunal was constituted but <em>after</em> each party had nominated an arbitrator and agreed that the two nominated arbitrators would subsequently nominate a third arbitrator to preside at the hearing of the ICC Arbitration, Alstom wrote to the SIAC and requested the SIAC to confirm whether it would accept jurisdiction over the dispute, and, if so, how the SIAC would administer the arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement if the dispute was submitted to it. This letter was not copied to Insigma.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"/>9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 17\u00a0November 2006, the SIAC replied to Alstom as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We have considered [the Arbitration Agreement] ... We are of the view that there is <em>prima facie</em> jurisdiction for the SIAC to accept the request for arbitration and administer the arbitration under [the Arbitration Agreement]. While [the Arbitration Agreement] is ambiguous as it brings into play both the SIAC Rules and the ICC Rules, some weight and meaning must be accorded to the reference to the ICC Rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If the case is submitted to the SIAC, the arbitration will be administered under the SIAC Rules with the ICC Rules to be applied as a guide to the essential features the parties would like to see in the conduct of the arbitration, e.g., use of the Terms of Reference procedure, the scrutiny of the awards. Accordingly, the SIAC is prepared and intends to undertake the Terms of Reference procedure and scrutiny of awards as contemplated under the ICC Rules. For purposes of performing these procedures, the equivalent functions of the \u201cSecretary-General\u201d and \u201cCourt\u201d would, under the SIAC system, be the Registrar and the Chairman, respectively. The SIAC is also prepared to remunerate the Tribunal to be appointed in accordance with an ad valorem scale along similar lines to that applied by the ICC. As regards the other administrative and financial aspects of the arbitration, they would necessarily have to be done by the SIAC Secretariat in accordance with the SIAC practices and procedures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The SIAC will accept the parties\u2019 existing Request for Arbitration, Answer and Counterclaim and other documents already submitted and consider these documents served on the date they are received by the SIAC.

Following this objection, Alstom wrote to the ICC on 11\u00a0December 2006 to withdraw the ICC Arbitration, reserving its right to bring proceedings before the ICC again if the SIAC or the Tribunal declined jurisdiction. The ICC Arbitration was eventually withdrawn by consent of the parties on 2\u00a0February 2007.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>Commencement of arbitration proceedings at the SIAC</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"/>12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 23\u00a0November 2006, Alstom commenced the arbitration at the SIAC. On the same day, Alstom also notified Prof\u00a0Michael Pryles (\u201cProf\u00a0Pryles\u201d) and Mr\u00a0Michael Hwang SC (\u201cMr\u00a0Hwang\u201d) (<em>ie</em>, the arbitrators nominated by Alstom and Insigma, respectively, under the Arbitration Agreement: see <a href=\"#p1_8\">[8]</a> above) of the transfer of the arbitration proceedings from the ICC to the SIAC.

The SIAC also called the parties\u2019 attention to, <em>inter alia</em>, the appointment of the members of the Tribunal. On 18\u00a0December 2006, the SIAC then wrote separately to Alstom and Insigma, requesting confirmation of their respective nominations of Prof\u00a0Pryles and Mr\u00a0Hwang as co-arbitrators.

The SIAC then invited the co-arbitrators to choose the third and presiding arbitrator pursuant to r\u00a08 of the SIAC Rules. Insigma, however, replied on 11\u00a0January 2007, stating that, contrary to the SIAC\u2019s letter of 10\u00a0January 2007, the applicable rules were the ICC Rules, and not the SIAC Rules, as provided under the Arbitration Agreement. On 23\u00a0January 2007, Alstom wrote to the SIAC stating that it would agree to the appointment of the third arbitrator being determined in accordance with the manner envisaged in the ICC Rules. Alstom\u2019s letter further noted that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Article\u00a08(4) of the ICC Rules provides that, in the absence of the parties\u2019 agreement upon another procedure, the ICC Court makes the appointment.

We informed SIAC of such agreement in our letter to you dated 23\u00a0November 2006.

Significantly, Insigma wrote to the SIAC on 6\u00a0February 2007 to confirm that it had <em>no</em> objection to Dr\u00a0Moser acting as the third arbitrator, although it repeated its \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the SIAC constituting the Tribunal in accordance with r\u00a08 of the SIAC Rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"/>16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, on 14\u00a0February 2007, Insigma, in a letter to Alstom, <em>confirmed</em> its agreement to the appointment of Dr\u00a0Moser <em>under the ICC Rules</em>:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We confirm that [Insigma] agrees to the appointment of Dr Moser as Chairman of the [Tribunal] by agreement between the two co-arbitrators, Mr Hwang and Professor Pryles, pursuant to Article 8(4) of the ICC Rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"/>17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 23\u00a0February 2007, the SIAC confirmed the constitution of the Tribunal comprising Dr\u00a0Moser as the presiding arbitrator, and Prof\u00a0Pryles and Mr\u00a0Hwang as co-arbitrators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"/>18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the Tribunal was duly constituted, it heard arguments on 11\u00a0September 2007 on the preliminary issues relating to its jurisdiction and the fatal uncertainty alleged by the appellant as to the operation of the Arbitration Agreement.

Party autonomy also meant that the parties were free to decide the conduct of the arbitration and the constitution of the arbitral tribunal and such freedom was an inherent feature of arbitration, especially <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"/>(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insigma\u2019s earlier position that the SIAC and not the ICC should administer the arbitration contradicted its present position that the ICC and not the SIAC should administer the arbitration (see <a href=\"#p1_7\">[7]</a> above).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_e\"/>(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since it was clear and undisputed that the parties intended to resolve their disputes by arbitration and not litigation, all reasonable effort should be made to give effect to the parties\u2019 intention to arbitrate in an <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration. Party autonomy should trump institutional self-interest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_f\"/>(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While it was generally not advisable or efficient to adopt or adapt institutional rules such as the ICC Rules for use in an <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration because of the need for an administering body, there was no practical problem nor objection in principle if the parties to the <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration nominated a substitute institution (the SIAC in this case) to administer the arbitration and substituted various organs to carry out similar functions to those carried out by the different parts of the ICC apparatus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"><strong>Issue of the validity of the constitution of the Tribunal</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"/>27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the issue of the validity of the constitution of the Tribunal, the High Court held that the Tribunal was validly constituted for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"/>(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insigma had acknowledged that the Tribunal was <em>properly</em> constituted under Art\u00a08(4) of the ICC Rules (see <a href=\"#p1_16\">[16]</a> above).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"/>(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a08(4) of the ICC Rules provided that where the parties had agreed upon the appointment procedure of the three arbitrators, the nomination of these three arbitrators would only be subject to the confirmation of either the ICC Court or the ICC Secretary General pursuant to Art\u00a09 of the ICC Rules. Here, Insigma (through its appointed arbitrator, Mr\u00a0Hwang) and Alstom (through its appointed arbitrator, Prof\u00a0Pryles) had <em>already</em> agreed to the appointment of Dr\u00a0Moser as the third arbitrator. Hence, their appointments need only be confirmed pursuant to Art\u00a09 of the ICC Rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"/>(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To determine whether the Tribunal had been validly constituted under the Arbitration Agreement, the court had to look at what the substantive appointment procedure was. Since the appointment procedures under the SIAC Rules and the ICC Rules were the same in effect and agreed to by the parties, whether the subsequent confirmation of the appointments by the SIAC was made with reference to the SIAC Rules or to the ICC Rules would have made no difference at all to the outcome. Hence, the Tribunal was actually constituted by the SIAC in accordance with (albeit without express reference to) the ICC Rules, and it was therefore validly constituted under the Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"/>28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We should also mention that, as the High Court noted (at [29]\u2013[30] of the Judgment), Insigma did advance an alternative argument that the Arbitration Agreement was a \u201cpathological clause\u201d (see the explanation of a \u201cpathological clause\u201d at <a href=\"#p1_37\">[37]</a> below) when it responded to Alstom\u2019s Request (see <a href=\"#p1_6\">[6]</a> above). However, this was merely a \u201ccursory and alternative submission\u201d, as the \u201cmain position taken [by Insigma in objecting to the ICC Arbitration] was for an SIAC-administered arbitration in accordance with [the] ICC Rules\u201d (at [30] of the Judgment).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The issues on appeal and our decision</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"/>29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insigma obtained leave of the High Court, under s\u00a010 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap\u00a0143A, 2002\u00a0Rev Ed) (\u201cIAA\u201d), to appeal against the decision of the High Court. Before us, Insigma raised the <em>same</em> two issues it had raised before the Tribunal and the High Court (see <a href=\"#p1_20\">[20]</a> above). As we had mentioned earlier (at <a href=\"#p1_2\">[2]</a> above), we dismissed the appeal at the conclusion of the hearing as we agreed entirely with the reasons given by the High Court in dismissing Insigma\u2019s application. However, we wish to make some observations on certain aspects of this case because, as we have mentioned at <a href=\"#p1_1\">[1]</a> above, this is the first occasion this court has had to consider the legal validity of a hybrid form of international arbitration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"/>30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our first observation is that an arbitration agreement (such as the Arbitration Agreement) should be construed like any other form of commercial agreement (see Julian D\u00a0M\u00a0Lew QC, Loukas A\u00a0Mistelis &amp; Stefan M\u00a0Kr\u00f6ll, <em>Comparative International Commercial Arbitration</em> (Kluwer Law International, 2003) at para\u00a07-60). The fundamental principle of documentary interpretation is to give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the document.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"/>31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our second observation is that, where the parties have evinced a clear intention to settle any dispute by arbitration, the court should give effect to such intention, even if certain aspects of the agreement may be ambiguous, inconsistent, incomplete or lacking in certain particulars (see <em>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Singapore</em>, vol\u00a02 (LexisNexis, 2003 Reissue, 2003) at para\u00a020.017) so long as the arbitration can be carried out without prejudice to the rights of either party and so long as giving effect to such intention does not result in an arbitration that is not within the contemplation of either party. This approach is similar to the \u201cprinciple of effective interpretation\u201d in international arbitration law, which was described in <em>Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration</em> (Kluwer Law International, 1999) (Emmanuel Gaillard &amp; John Savage eds) (\u201c<em>Fouchard</em>\u201d) at p\u00a0258 as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">B. \u2013 THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE INTERPRETATION</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>478</b>. \u2014 The second principle of interpretation of arbitration agreements is the principle of effective interpretation. This principle is inspired by provisions such as Article 1157 of the French Civil Code, according to which \u201cwhere a clause can be interpreted in two different ways, the interpretation enabling the clause to be effective should be adopted in preference to that which prevents the clause from being effective.\u201d This common-sense rule whereby, if in doubt, one should \u201cprefer the interpretation which gives meaning to the words, rather than that which renders them useless or nonsensical,\u201d is widely accepted not only by the courts but also by arbitrators who readily acknowledge it to be a \u201cuniversally recognized rule of interpretation.\u201d To give just one example of the application of this principle, an arbitral tribunal interpreting a pathological clause held that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">when inserting an arbitration clause in their contract the intention of the parties must be presumed to have been willing to establish an effective machinery for the settlement of disputes covered by the arbitration clause.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"/>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A subsidiary principle to the principle of effective interpretation is the principle that an arbitration agreement should also not be interpreted restrictively or strictly. An arbitration agreement is not a statute. This was noted in <em>Fouchard</em> at pp\u00a0260\u2013261:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">D. \u2013 REJECTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF STRICT INTERPRETATION</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">...</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[T]his principle [that an arbitration agreement should be interpreted \u201crestrictively\u201d] is generally rejected in international arbitration. It is based on the idea that an arbitration agreement constitutes an exception to the principle of the jurisdiction of the courts, and that, as laws of exception are strictly interpreted, the same should apply to arbitration agreements. \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">This has been frequently confirmed in arbitral case law. For example, the Decision on Jurisdiction rendered in the <em>Amco</em> arbitration sets out the principle in general terms:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">like any other convention, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties: such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle <em>pacta sunt servanda</em>, a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The interpretation of arbitration agreements by the French courts has, likewise, never been strict nor restrictive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"/>33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another subsidiary principle is that, as far as possible, a commercially logical and sensible construction is to be preferred over another that is commercially illogical (see <em>Law Debenture Trust Corporation Plc v Elektrim Finance BV</em> [2005] 2\u00a0Lloyd\u2019s Rep 755 at [39]). In the present case, the Judge applied this principle at [33]\u2013[34] of the Judgment:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the absence of an administering authority, the adoption of the ICC Rules is likely to be construed as designating the ICC to be the institution conducting the arbitration. Further the selection of a particular institutional arbitral body to conduct the arbitration will be construed as also selecting the rules of that body to govern the procedure adopted in the arbitration. [David Joseph\u00a0QC, <em>Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements and their Enforcement</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2005)] states at para\u00a04.27:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">In many cases parties will expressly agree to submit disputes to a particular institutional arbitral body. \u2026 An agreement to refer disputes to such a body will be deemed to incorporate an agreement to abide by the rules and procedures of that body in force at the time arbitration is commenced. Not only will the arbitration be governed by that institution\u2019s rules but it will also be administered by that organisation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The present case, however, despite the nomination of the SIAC as the body to conduct the arbitration, is not an example of institutional arbitration by the SIAC, since the arbitration agreement specifically designated the use of [the] ICC Rules instead. \u2026 <em>By designating a separate administering authority, the parties indicated that the adoption of the ICC Rules was not a selection of the administering authority but only an agreement for the arbitration to take place by reference to those rules</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"/>34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This approach to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement is necessary to uphold the underlying and fundamental principle of party autonomy as far as possible in the selection of the kind of arbitration and the terms of the arbitration. Given the inherently private and consensual nature of arbitration, our courts will ordinarily respect the principle of party autonomy and give effect to (workable) agreed arbitration arrangements in international arbitration, subject only to any public policy considerations to the contrary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"/>35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our third observation is that, in this appeal, Insigma did not argue that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"/>(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in international arbitration, parties must opt either for an institutional arbitration (where the rules of that institution apply) or a non-institutional arbitration (where the parties make their own rules or, in the absence of such rules, the arbitrators make their own rules); or</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"/>(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it is inherent in the nature of arbitration that <em>one</em> institution (such as the SIAC or the ICC) may not administer an arbitration applying the rules of <em>another</em> institution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">Rather, Insigma\u2019s argument was that, at an operational level, the Arbitration Agreement was too uncertain to be given effect to. However, Insigma was unable to explain or to convince us where the uncertainty lay, and why the Arbitration Agreement could not or did not work in the manner explained by the Tribunal or the High Court. All that Insigma could contend in support of its argument was that the root of uncertainty arose because the ICC Rules were procedural rules drafted for an arbitration to be administered by the ICC and not by any other arbitral institution (such as the SIAC). In this respect, we agreed with the views of the High Court at [35] of the Judgment:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The arrangement provided for in [the Arbitration Agreement] would be unworkable if the SIAC was unable to provide similarly equipped actors to fulfil the roles that the ICC Rules gave to the institutional bodies of the ICC. However, while it might not be advisable to use the ICC Rules for most <em>ad hoc</em> arbitrations because of the need for an administering body, if the <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration nominates a substitute institution to administer the arbitration and such substitute can arrange organs to carry out similar functions to those carried out by the different parts of the ICC apparatus, there should be no practical problem, as well as no objection in principle, to providing for such a hybrid <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration administered by one institution but governed by the rules (as adapted where necessary) of another. This freedom is inherent in the flexible nature of arbitration, especially <em>ad hoc</em> arbitration. In any case, inefficiency alone cannot render a clause invalid so long as the parties had agreed and intended for the arbitration to be conducted in this manner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"/>36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our fourth observation concerns Insigma\u2019s argument based on branding in the service industry, including that of institutional arbitration. As we had mentioned earlier, Insigma contended that it had bargained for an \u201cICC\u2019s hallmark of quality\u201d with respect to the arbitration (see <a href=\"#p1_23\">[23]</a> above), and that it would not get this \u201challmark\u201d in an SIAC-administered arbitration. We would agree that branding in services is just as crucial as the branding of products. Many consumers know the quality of a product or a service by its brand, and that is why a trade or service mark may be a valuable asset. Motorists know the quality and prestige of a Rolls Royce by its name alone. Many business people in Asia might not know the precise structure of an ICC-administered arbitration, but certainly all commercial lawyers who are familiar with international arbitration would be familiar with the ICC brand of arbitration, and also with SIAC arbitration. We would expect Insigma\u2019s legal advisers to have known about the ICC and the SIAC when they advised Insigma to accept the ICC Rules in an SIAC-administered arbitration rather than an ICC-administered arbitration. And it was reasonable for this court to assume that when they did so each thought the arrangement was necessary to avoid any impasse as to which institutional arbitration to adopt. Both parties agreed to arbitrate their differences subject to the terms of the Arbitration Agreement with knowledge of the quality of an ICC arbitration and also the quality of an SIAC arbitration on the advice of their legal advisers. Therefore, in our view, Insigma\u2019s argument that it was receiving an inferior brand of arbitration made no sense. This was especially so when Insigma objected to the ICC Arbitration which Alstom had originally initiated on the ground that the Arbitration Agreement had \u201cclearly\u201d provided for an SIAC-administered arbitration (see <a href=\"#p1_7\">[7]</a> above) and had even insisted that Alstom first withdraw the ICC Arbitration before submitting the dispute to the SIAC for arbitration (see <a href=\"#p1_11\">[11]</a> above). It was also ironic that Insigma chose to avoid an SIAC-administered arbitration which it itself had earlier agreed to because of the SIAC\u2019s lower costs of administration (see <a href=\"#p1_7\">[7]</a> above).</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"/>37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our fifth observation relates to Insigma\u2019s argument that the Arbitration Agreement should not be given effect to because it was a \u201cpathological clause\u201d as the hybrid form of arbitration contemplated in the Arbitration Agreement was uncertain or unworkable. Calling the Arbitration Agreement \u201cpathological\u201d does not, of course, change its legal character or its substance. The idea of a pathological clause is derived from the civil law. That expression is defined in <em>Fouchard</em> (<a href=\"#p1_31\">[31]</a> <em>supra</em>) at p\u00a0262 as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>484</b>. \u2014 The expression \u201cpathological clause\u201d\u2026 denotes arbitration agreements, and particularly arbitration clauses, which contain a defect or defects liable to disrupt the smooth progress of the arbitration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"/>38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A defect in an arbitration clause does not necessarily negate the agreement thereby constituted. It depends on the nature or the substance of the defect, or whether the defect is curable. The concept of a pathological clause fulfils a <em>descriptive</em> function rather than a <em>prescriptive</em> function and labelling or describing a clause as \u201cpathological\u201d does not automatically invalidate it as an agreement. In Benjamin G\u00a0Davis, \u201cPathological Clauses: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Eisemann\u2019s Still Vital Criteria\u201d (1991) 7\u00a0Arb Int 365 at 379, the author noted:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Certain pathologies that have touched on some or all of the essential functions of the arbitration clause have been examined. Notwithstanding the severe defects of many of the clauses, the fortuitous \u2013 but unpredictable \u2013 assistance of state courts, able institutions, and imaginative arbitrators, could still make them work. My intention has been to show what pitfalls should be avoided, while yet noting that arbitration under these clauses could still proceed to a final award susceptible of enforcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"/>39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The acceptance by arbitration practitioners that a pathological clause is not void <em>ab initio</em> is also expressed in <em>Fouchard</em> at pp\u00a0262\u2013263 in the following terms:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Arbitration agreements can be pathological for a variety of reasons. \u2026 At worst, the defect will prevent the arbitration from taking place at all. This will be the case where it is impossible to infer an intention which is sufficiently coherent and effective to enable the arbitration to function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">These clauses will need to be interpreted by the arbitrators, and by the courts reviewing the existence of an arbitration agreement and ensuring that the arbitrators remained within the bounds of their jurisdiction. <em>In most cases, the arbitrators or the courts \u2013 relying on the principle of effective interpretation more than on any rule</em> in favorem validitatis <em>\u2013 will salvage the arbitration clause by restoring the true intention of the parties, which was previously distorted by the parties\u2019 ignorance of the mechanics of arbitration</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><em>Fouchard</em> also noted at p\u00a0266 that:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The approach of the French courts is thus invariably to interpret pathological arbitration clauses so as to render them effective if at all possible. The same trend can be found in other jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"/>40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, the Arbitration Agreement does not satisfy the qualifying conditions of a pathological clause as understood in <em>Fouchard</em> and by Davis (see <a href=\"#p1_38\">[38]</a> above), but whatever it is, it was rendered certain and workable in the present case by the SIAC agreeing to administer the arbitration in accordance with the ICC Rules, and to nominate appropriate functional bodies that correspond to the bodies required under the ICC Rules to, <em>inter alia</em>, supervise the arbitration. In our view, the only aspect of uncertainty or inoperability with regard to the Arbitration Agreement was the contingency of the SIAC declining to administer the arbitration according to the ICC Rules, a position it appeared to have taken originally (see <a href=\"#p1_9\">[9]</a> above), but one which it sensibly abandoned subsequently (see <a href=\"#p1_19\">[19]</a> above). If the SIAC had so declined, then it could be said that neither Insigma nor Alstom got what they had bargained for in the Arbitration Agreement. That, however, was not the case here, and Insigma\u2019s argument that the clause was pathological had no factual or legal basis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"/>41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our final observation pertains to the question of whether there are policy considerations to bar the SIAC, as a matter of jurisdiction or power, from agreeing to administer the arbitration of the kind agreed to by the parties in the Arbitration Agreement. In this connection, it is useful to refer to Singapore\u2019s policy on the role of international commercial arbitration in resolving commercial disputes in Singapore. This is set out in s\u00a015A of the IAA, which provides as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>Application of rules of arbitration</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>15A</b>.\u2014(1)\u00a0It is hereby declared for the avoidance of doubt that a provision of rules of arbitration agreed to or adopted by the parties, whether before or after the commencement of the arbitration, shall apply and be given effect to the extent that such provision is not inconsistent with a provision of the Model Law [UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration] or this Part from which the parties cannot derogate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to subsection\u00a0(1), subsections\u00a0(3) to (6) shall apply for the purposes of determining whether a provision of rules of arbitration is inconsistent with the Model Law or this Part.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A provision of rules of arbitration is not inconsistent with the Model Law or this Part merely because it provides for a matter on which the Model Law and this Part is silent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rules of arbitration are not inconsistent with the Model Law or this Part merely because the rules are silent on a matter covered by any provision of the Model Law or this Part.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A provision of rules of arbitration is not inconsistent with the Model Law or this Part merely because it provides for a matter which is covered by a provision of the Model Law or this Part which allows the parties to make their own arrangements by agreement but which applies in the absence of such agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties may make the arrangements referred to in subsection\u00a0(5) by agreeing to the application or adoption of rules of arbitration or by providing any other means by which a matter may be decided.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this section and section\u00a015, \u201crules of arbitration\u201d means the rules of arbitration agreed to or adopted by the parties including the rules of arbitration of an institution or organisation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"/>42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the second reading in Parliament of the International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill (Bill\u00a028 of 2002) to amend the IAA by enacting s\u00a015A of the IAA, the Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc\u00a0Prof\u00a0Ho Peng Kee, explained Singapore\u2019s policy with regard to party autonomy in the choice of arbitration rules to govern the parties\u2019 arbitration (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (1\u00a0October 2002) vol\u00a075 at cols\u00a01107\u20131109):</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">\u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc.

A mandatory provision is one whereby the Act or Model Law does not permit the parties to derogate from or vary [it]. <em>This therefore reinforces the principle of party autonomy, and makes it clear beyond doubt that no set of arbitration rules ought ever to be regarded as incompatible with the Act or the Model Law</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The remaining subsections seek to flesh out the concept of inconsistency, by referring to a number of scenarios where there could be doubts as to whether any inconsistency exists. \u2026</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><em>To summarise, the general approach is that arbitration rules adopted by the parties will be given full effect</em>. Where there is a conflict between the arbitration rules and the Act or the Model Law, the rules will prevail unless the conflict is with a mandatory provision of the Act or the Model Law. <em>Hence, in effect, with this narrow exception, parties to a Singapore arbitration will have the full freedom to adopt arbitration rules of their choice</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">In this connection, counsel for Insigma did not advance any argument to suggest that the ICC Rules are inconsistent with any mandatory provision of the IAA or the Model Law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"/>43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section\u00a015A implicitly recognises that an arbitral institution may play or be asked to play many roles in a particular arbitration, depending on the parties. David St\u00a0John Sutton, Judith Gill &amp; Matthew Gearing, <em>Russell on Arbitration</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 23rd\u00a0Ed, 2007) at para\u00a03-052 also comments on this industry practice:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"><b>Role of institutions in arbitration agreements</b>. Arbitration institutions can play an important role in arbitration agreements. They and their rules are often specified in the arbitration agreement, although the parties may agree to take advantage of the services offered by an institution after a dispute has arisen. An arbitral institution may adopt a number of different roles in relation to the arbitration proceedings depending upon what the parties have agreed their role should be. In particular the institution may:</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provide arbitration rules pursuant to which the arbitration will be conducted;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0act as the appointing authority which, in the absence of agreement between the parties, appoints the tribunal to hear the dispute and may also deal with any challenges to or replacement of arbitrators;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0act as an account holder for fees and deposits and administer the funds necessary to pay for the tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0supervise the conduct of the arbitration by acting as an administrator for the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">The role of the SIAC in the present case is precisely that of an administrator of arbitration proceedings to be conducted under the ICC Rules. The choice of a hybrid form of arbitration is a matter of agreement between the parties and is wholly consistent with the policy considerations we have noted at <a href=\"#p1_41\">[41]</a>\u2013<a href=\"#p1_42\">[42]</a> above.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"/>44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the above reasons, we unanimously dismissed the appeal.

The offence took place on 10\u00a0March 2003 at about 12.22pm on the tenth floor of Block\u00a0202 Choa Chu Kang Avenue\u00a01, Singapore.

However, they only became close around the first quarter of 2002. That developed into an intimate relationship, and they would stay together at the deceased\u2019s flat and the flat of her colleague and close friend, Goh Lye Keow (\u201cRita\u201d), from time to time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">4<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Woo\u00a0J had found that the relationship between the appellant and the deceased was under strain months before the murder.

Rita gave evidence that the deceased had also told her that she was unhappy with her relationship with the appellant and was thinking of ending it although she was prepared to continue with it to see how it would go. Soon Shen Chwee, a friend of the appellant, gave evidence that on 4\u00a0March 2003, the appellant told him that he had broken up with his girlfriend for a week.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">6<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> There was more direct evidence on the state of the relationship nearer to 10\u00a0March 2003, the day the deceased died. On the afternoon of 9\u00a0March, the appellant had been to the deceased\u2019s flat. He was not able to see the deceased. Instead he met her mother, Chioh Ah Hoi, and handed to her a bird in a birdcage and an envelope addressed to the deceased. In the evening, he rang the flat repeatedly to speak to the deceased. When Mdm\u00a0Chioh told him that she was not there, he told her to consider herself to have given birth to one daughter less.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">7<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The letter to the deceased was in Chinese, which, when translated into English read:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I do not know that I did wrong.

I can understand, as there are many men at 97(?) [This refers to a lounge the deceased worked at]. However, it is because of work that I have no time to keep you company. I will have regrets even if I die. I know I am useless and you have to lead a miserable life(?). You may think that the reason I want to be with you is to have sex with you. You are wrong, dear(?).

He told Rita that the deceased had mentioned the previous day that she wanted to end their relationship. The appellant also said to Rita words to the effect that \u201cYou just take it that you have lost a good friend.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">9<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> When the deceased spoke to the appellant over the telephone, she told him that they should terminate their relationship. This statement so upset the appellant who was then outside the deceased\u2019s flat that he kicked and damaged the front metal gate of the flat. That woke up the deceased\u2019s sister, Teo Siew Hoon Karen, who was annoyed upon seeing him and the damaged gate. When she chided him, he complained about the way the deceased had treated him, and protested that he did not know why their relationship had gone bad, and said that he would hold onto the deceased and jump down from the block without regrets. The deceased\u2019s son, who was with Karen, heard the exchange.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">10<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> At about 2.00am (on 10\u00a0March 2003), the appellant was outside Rita\u2019s flat looking for the deceased. He was told that the deceased was not there, and was refused entry into the flat. He again became upset, shook the metal gate violently, and put a padlock on it. He challenged Rita\u2019s husband to call the police. When the latter did that, he removed the padlock, apologised and left before the police arrived.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">11<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The next episode unfolded at between 11.00am and 12.00\u00a0noon at the deceased\u2019s place of work. The appellant appeared at her office, grabbed her by her hair and pulled her to the staircase. When Rita intervened to get him to release her, he struck Rita on the nose, and forcefully brought the deceased down to his lorry.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The final event took place at Block\u00a0202 where the deceased\u2019s flat was sited. Leong Siew Choon and Goh Poh See were residents in the block. They had fetched their children from a kindergarten and were walking towards the block when they noticed the appellant\u2019s lorry approaching the block at a high speed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">13<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> When the two women arrived at the void deck of the block, they waited for the lift to take them to the tenth floor from where they would walk down to their flats on the ninth floor. They saw the appellant and the deceased approaching, but the couple did not enter the lift with them and their children.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">14<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> When they arrived at the tenth floor, the two women chatted a while before making their way to their respective homes in different directions. As they walked, they both had further occasion to look at the couple who were then on the tenth floor corridor. Mdm\u00a0Leong saw the man use his hands to lift up both the legs of the woman, with his hands slightly stretched and palms opened, holding onto her knees. The woman\u2019s legs were off the ground, and she was holding onto the railing on the parapet along the corridor with both hands, uttering something like \u201caw, aw, aw\u201d softly. Initially Mdm\u00a0Leong thought the couple was playing because the woman was not struggling. But the man lifted the woman\u2019s legs higher, and she then disappeared from sight. Mdm\u00a0Leong looked over the parapet, and saw a body lying motionless on the pavement below. Mdm\u00a0Leong disagreed with Mr\u00a0Rasif, counsel for the appellant, that the man had both his arms around the knees of the woman or that he was trying to prevent her from throwing herself over the parapet.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">16<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Mdm\u00a0Goh turned around to look at the couple when she heard a female voice uttering \u201cai, ai\u201d. She saw the woman holding onto the railing on the parapet with both hands, while the man who was behind her was holding onto her ankles and lifting her body upwards.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">17<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The deceased died from the fall.

SSgt\u00a0Ishak asked the appellant what had happened, and he replied in English, \u201cI killed her.\u201d He also said, \u201cI already push her down.

This was in the form of an entry in the patrol car log sheet made by SC\u00a0Shahrul about one hour after the event. The entry, which read in part:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">When mobile was interviewing B1 [the Appellant] he was aggressive, smell of alcohol drunkard and bare footed he was wearing a shirt (few of the shirt button were unbutton) tuck out and blue jeans.

The words \u201cI already push her down\u201d were added on the instruction of SSgt\u00a0Ishak after he read over the recording made by SC\u00a0Shahrul. Both officers confirmed that those added words were spoken by the appellant.

While he was there, Senior Staff Sergeant Pavia Roy Nicholas (\u201cSSSgt\u00a0Pavia\u201d) and Staff Sergeant\u00a0Ng Leng Sing (\u201cSSgt\u00a0Ng\u201d) attempted to interview him, but he was in an agitated state and said in Hokkien, \u201cI kill human being. I did not run. I waited for you to come. Why you all treat me like that? I want to take revenge against the police.\u201d This was interpreted into English by SSgt\u00a0Ng, and SSSgt\u00a0Pavia recorded it into his field diary.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">22<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> On the following day, 11\u00a0March 2003, a cautioned statement was recorded from the appellant where he said:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I did not kill her. That day I managed to get her at her office. I had been trying to get her for the past 3 days. We went to the carpark at Kranji. We had a talk for a while. She was heavily indebted. She owed credit card companies at least S$10,000/= over. I was unable to help her anymore. In fact, I had helped her to repay the credit card companies and expenses for more than S$20,000/=. She was a drug addict and spent at least S$500/= a month on the drugs. Her salary was not enough for her expenses. I love her very much and had all along tolerated what she had done. At that time, I was badly drank [<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">sic</i>] as I had been drinking since last Friday. As I could not help her anymore, we discussed and decided to die together. She suggested that we go back to her block of flat. She had just bought this flat at Block\u00a0202 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 1 #10-xx and she had a lot of financial and family problems pertaining to this flat. I drove her back to her block of flat in my lorry. I parked my lorry at the carpark haphazardly because she already ran out of the lorry. I chased after her and went up to the 10<sup>th</sup> floor together with her in the lift. When the lift door opened at the 10<sup>th</sup> floor, she ran out and climbed over the parapet. I wanted to follow her but her father came out of the flat and grabbed my body. \u2026 Furthermore, she was a drug addict.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">23<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The appellant\u2019s defence was along the lines of the cautioned statement, with elaboration on his actions on 9 and 10\u00a0March 2003. He admitted that he had written the letter delivered to the deceased\u2019s mother, but denied telling her that she should consider herself to have given birth to one daughter less.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">24<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He agreed that he spoke to Rita over the telephone, but could not recall telling her that she should consider herself to have lost a good friend.

His defence was that after they left the office, they went to a car park near Kranji Dam. While they were there, they had a quarrel. The deceased talked of her problems that she could not resolve. He suggested that they die together. She agreed and they returned to her flat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">27<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> When they reached the tenth floor, he was distracted momentarily when he saw someone repairing the gate of the deceased\u2019s flat. When he looked at the deceased again, she was at the parapet. Her hands were on the parapet, and her feet were off the floor. He tried to grab hold of her, but failed. Although his hands touched her legs, he was unable to have his arms around her knees.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">28<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He denied that he told SSgt\u00a0Ishak and SC\u00a0Shahrul that he had killed the deceased and had pushed her down and he disputed SSgt\u00a0Ng\u2019s account of his statement at Jurong Police Division Headquarters, and asserted that he said he did <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">not</i> kill a human being.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">29<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Woo\u00a0J found that the relationship between the appellant and the deceased was under strain at the time of her death. He came to this conclusion on the basis of the appellant\u2019s letter to the deceased, the deceased\u2019s telling Rita that she had told the appellant that she wanted to end the relationship, the appellant telling Rita to consider herself to have lost a good friend, his telling Karen that he could hold onto the deceased and jump down, his telling the deceased\u2019s son that he was to die with the deceased, the kicking of the gate at the deceased\u2019s flat and the padlocking of the gate at Rita\u2019s flat. In addition to that, there was the appellant\u2019s ominous advice to the deceased\u2019s mother that she should consider herself to have given birth to one daughter fewer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">30<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> It was abundantly clear that he was angry and unhappy with the deceased on the days leading to her death, and that the deceased\u2019s death was on his mind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">31<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Against this background, we share the trial judge\u2019s scepticism at the appellant\u2019s evidence on the suicide pact he made with the deceased after they left her office, and before going to her flat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">32<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The judge gave particular attention to the events on the tenth floor corridor. He accepted the evidence of the two neighbours who witnessed the incident. He accepted that there was some inconsistency in their evidence, but found that it did not detract from their evidence that they saw the appellant holding the legs of the deceased and lifting her. This evidence contradicted the appellant\u2019s evidence that he tried unsuccessfully to stop the deceased climbing over the parapet.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">33<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> He did not accept that the deceased, who was 1.48m tall could climb over the 1.3m tall railing in her platform shoes as quickly and easily as the appellant described.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">34<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> The judge also considered the evidence in the statements the appellant was alleged to have made to SSgt\u00a0Ishak and SC\u00a0Shahrul at the scene. Woo\u00a0J noted that counsel had, when cross-examining SSgt\u00a0Ishak, suggested to him that when the appellant said \u201cI killed her\u201d, he meant that he felt responsible for her death. The suggestion was significant as it was an acceptance that those words were said. However, when the appellant gave evidence, he denied that he had said that, thereby detracting from the earlier position, and taking a position (that he did not say those words) that was not put to the prosecution witnesses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">35<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> Woo\u00a0J found that those words were said, as well as the words \u201cI already push her down\u201d which were added to the entry in the patrol car log sheet on the direction of SSgt\u00a0Ishak. The judge found no reason for SSgt\u00a0Ishak to fabricate his evidence, and found his recollection of the words to be reliable.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">36<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> On the alleged statement made at Jurong Police Division Headquarters that \u201cI kill human being\u201d, the judge noted that when SSgt\u00a0Ng gave evidence on that, defence counsel put it to him that the appellant did not say that. The appellant\u2019s evidence was that he said \u201cI did <span style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: italic\">not</span> kill human being\u201d. There is a significant difference between not having said something, and having said something that was not fully understood. The possibility that the appellant actually said that he did not kill was not put to the prosecution witness; counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Sgt\u00a0Ishak left the impression that the appellant had said nothing at all.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">37<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> On the appeal before us, Mr\u00a0Rasif focused on three points:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(a)<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the evidence of the two neighbours;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(b)<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the trial judge\u2019s reliance on the appellant\u2019s oral confession \u201cI already push her down\u201d; and</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-2\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(c)<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> the trial judge\u2019s rejection of the appellant\u2019s account of events disclosed in his cautioned statement.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" style=\"MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">38<span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> These were matters that Woo\u00a0J had dealt with at length.

Damages were awarded against the Bansals. We heard the appeal on 26 November 2002 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><strong>The facts</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">2 The trial was a consolidation of three suits instituted by CBI against the Bansals and another party, Natsyn Fibres Pte Ltd (\"Natsyn\"). Natsyn was a company incorporated in Singapore with the Bansals as the only shareholders and directors. The action against Natsyn was not proceeded with because the latter was wound up before the trial began.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">3 In 1997, Natsyn purchased certain goods from two Indian companies, Bhagwati Cottons Ltd (\u2018Bhagwati\u2019) and GPB Fibres Ltd (\"GPB\"). Bhagwati and GPB were founded by Bansal\u2019s father and were family companies. At all material times, Bansal was a director and held substantial equity interest in both companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">4 To effect the purchase, Natsyn obtained the issue of a letter of credit from Campagnie Financiere De Cic Et De L\u2019Union Europeene (\"CF Bank\") and another from Mees Pierson NV, (\"Mees Pierson\"). Both LCs were governed by the UCP 500 and the credit was available by negotiation. The beneficiaries of the credit were Bhagwati and GPB. For the purpose of the trial, the parties had not differentiated between Bhagwati and GPB. Therefore, hereinafter, reference to \"Bhagwati\" shall include \"GPB\".</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">5 Upon shipment of the goods, Bhagwati presented the requisite documents to CBI for negotiation under the LCs (\"LC documents\") and was paid. CBI placed its stamp on all the documents. Subsequently, CBI handed the LC documents back to Bhagwati, without having received payment from either Bhagwati or any other party. Eventually, the documents came into the possession of Natsyn, who, without paying for the same, used the documents to obtain delivery of the goods. Thereafter, Natsyn sold the goods to a third party. By the time CBI realised what had happened and sought payment, Natsyn did not have the funds to pay in full. It effected only partial payments leaving outstanding the sums of US$1,190.893.28 and $274,319.04 under the two LCs, which formed the subject matter of the action.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\">Decision below</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">6 The action was based on conversion, conspiracy and dishonest assistance to a breach of trust. The trial below ended with the Bansals electing to submit that they had no case to answer. The trial judge, accepted that submission insofar as the claim was based on the tort of conspiracy. In his view, there was simply nothing to indicate any conspiracy as no evidence was presented to show the circumstances under which the LC documents were handed over by CBI to Bhagwati and, in turn, to Natsyn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">7 However, the judge found that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case of conversion and dishonest assistance. He based his determination primarily on the fact that CBI were entitled to the documents having paid for them. Natsyn, and in turn the Bansals, would have known that CBI had negotiated the documents as the CBI stamp appeared on all the documents. Ordinarily, the documents would have come through the issuing banks, i.e., CF Bank and Mees Pierson, in exchange for payments by Natsyn. However, Natsyn did not pay for the documents and the Bansals, being the directors in charge of Natsyn, would have known of that. The Bansals, being the mind behind Natsyn, nevertheless used the documents to obtain delivery of the goods and disposed of them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\">Appeal</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">8 In the appeal, the Bansals raised two broad issues. The first was that the trial judge had not applied the correct test in determining whether there was a case to answer. The second was, whether there was sufficient evidence upon which the court could enter judgment in favour of CBI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">9 The Bansals submitted that, in the absence of any evidence to show how, and why, the documents were handed over to Bhagwati, there was no basis to hold that they had committed conversion or rendered dishonest assistance to a breach of trust.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\">The correct test</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">10 The trial judge, having noted the views of the authors of the book, <i>Aronson &amp; Hunter on</i> <i>\"Litigation: Evidence and Procedure\"</i> (16<sup>th</sup> Edn), at p. 732, stated (at \u00b621 of his Grounds of Judgment) that \u2013</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">\"A decision by a defendant not to adduce evidence in his defence is a decision that ought not to be lightly taken. Where a defendant makes such an election, the result will be that the court is left with only the plaintiff\u2019s version of the story. So long as there is some prima facie evidence that supports the essential limbs of the plaintiff\u2019s claim(s), then the failure by the defendant to adduce evidence on his own behalf would be fatal to the defendant.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">11 Counsel for the Bansals submitted that, in accordance with the views of the Court of Appeal in <i>Storey v Storey</i> [1960] 3 All ER 279, there were two different circumstances where a defendant could submit that there was no case to answer and the consequence might not be the same for both circumstances should the submission fail. First, a no case submission could be made on the basis that, accepting the plaintiff\u2019s evidence at its face value, no case has been established in law. Second, the submission could be made on the basis that the evidence led for the plaintiff was so unsatisfactory, or unreliable, that the court should find that the burden of proof had not been discharged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">12 We should point out that <i>Storey v Storey</i> was examined by the trial judge, but it was distinguished on the ground that there the appellate court was considering the circumstances in which it could nevertheless, in a case where a submission of no case to answer had not been upheld, direct that a new trial be held. In that case, there was an appeal from an order of the Divisional Court directing that there should be a re-hearing of a summons for maintenance issued by the appellant wife against her husband based on persistent cruelty and desertion. The summons was first heard before justices of the peace where the husband elected, in submitting that there was no case for him to answer, that he would not call any evidence. The submission was accepted by the justices and the complaint was dismissed. The wife appealed. Though the Divisional Court thought that the justices were wrong to have accepted the submission of no case to answer, it did not make an order for maintenance in her favour or to have the case remitted to the same justices for further findings of fact. Instead, it ordered a new trial before a fresh panel of justices. Ormerod LJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said (at p. 282):-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">\"There can, we think, be no doubt that in the former type of submission a defendant is bound by his election, and there can be no new trial. This rule, in our opinion, however, does not of necessity apply to the second type of case where the judge is invited to dismiss the case because of the unsatisfactory or unreliable nature of the evidence. In some cases it may well be that the appellate court will be able to decide the case without sending it back, but in others, and this in our judgment is certainly one, justice could not be done without a re-hearing. \u2026. In our opinion, if the submission of no case is based on the unsatisfactory or unreliable nature of the evidence led by the plaintiff, and the appellate court finds itself unable on the findings of the court below to come to a just conclusion, the only course to be adopted in the interests of justice is to order a new trial, even if the defendant has elected to stand on his submission.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">13 It seemed to us clear that the English Court of Appeal there agreed that there should be a new trial, notwithstanding the election by the husband because, and this seemed to be an important consideration, the case raised a question of status and thereby some public interest was involved. Ormerod LJ said (on the same page):-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">\"\u2026 .. it is better in matrimonial disputes for the justices to hear both sides before coming to a decision, particularly as a finding by them of desertion or persistent cruelty may form the basis for a subsequent petition for divorce.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">14 The trial judge was clearly conscious of the second circumstance under which a submission of no case to answer could be made. He did not rule out that a submission of no case could also be made on that basis, as can be seen from this observation of his (\u00b625 of his Grounds of Judgment):- -</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">\"It may be that the view taken by <i>Aronson and Hunter</i> was too restrictive and that a submission of no case to meet may also be upheld where the evidence adduced by the plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court is able to find that the burden of proof on the plaintiff has not been discharged. But that said, I nevertheless consider the summary by Aronson and Hunter a helpful one.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">15 The summary of <i>Aronson and Hunter</i> that the judge referred to was the passage found at p. 732 of the book:-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">However, if the defence leads no evidence where there is a case to answer, its silence could (depending on the facts) be taken to strengthen the opposing case. In particular, circumstantial evidence which could cut both ways might well look stronger if the defendant or accused is in a position to dispel the doubt, but refuses to go into evidence: <i>May v O\u2019Sullivan</i> (1955) 92 CLR 654; and <i>Weissensteiner v R</i> (1993) 178 CLR 217.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">16 In electing not to adduce any evidence, the submission of the Bansals was that, even accepting the plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the face of it, no case had been made out against them. The submission made was not on the basis that the evidence led for the CBI was unsatisfactory or unreliable. This was a submission of no case to answer of the first type enumerated in <i>Storey v Storey</i>. Therefore, the trial judge did not apply any wrong test or principle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\"><i>Prima Facie</i> case</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">17 We now turn to consider the second issue as to whether the court below was correct to have ruled that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out in respect of the claims in conversion and dishonest assistance and given judgment in favour of CBI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">18 CBI called only one witness, Vijay Kumar Bhandari (Bhandari), its General Manager at the head office at Mumbai since 1996. The relevant records of accounts of Bhagwati were maintained at one of CBI branches at Mumbai. Bhandari had no personal knowledge relating to the transactions with Bhagwati and neither did he know why or how the LC documents were released to Bhagwati. He sought to adduce in evidence a pile of documents called \"Process Notes\", without the maker(s) being called to testify in court. The \"Process Notes\" were notes kept by officers of CBI of conversations with customers. The trial judge had ruled that those notes were inadmissible as evidence as they did not fall within the exceptions permitted under s 32(b) and s 34 of the Evidence Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">19 The Bansals argued that, stripped of hearsay and other inadmissible evidence, what Bhandari stated amounted to no more than that CBI negotiated the documents tendered by Bhagwati under the LCs and that CBI obtained possession of the documents. Upon negotiation, the stamp of CBI was also placed on the documents. However, for reasons unknown, CBI passed the documents back to Bhagwati. The documents eventually found their way to Singapore into the hands of Natsyn, which used them to obtain delivery of the goods. On these bare facts, there was nothing to suggest that the Bansals committed the tort of conversion or of knowingly assisting in the commission of a breach of trust.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">20 As at the close of the case for CBI, this was the view of the trial judge (\u00b628 of his Grounds of Judgment) -</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">\" \u2026 there was evidence on which the court could come to the conclusion that the Bansals knew, when they (through Natsyn) dealt with the goods covered by the documents, that the documents were the property of CBI. In proceeding to deal with the goods despite that knowledge, the Bansals could well be liable in conversion and/or as constructive trustees. But, by electing not to testify, the Bansals have elected not to put before the court their explanation of the events that happened. In these circumstances, I can only conclude that they had no defence to these claims.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">21 Before us, counsel for the Bansals made the following four points in contending that a <i>prima facie</i> case of conversion on the part of the Bansals had not been made out \u2013</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">(i) CBI did not have the <i>locus standi</i> to sue, as they had not shown that they had actual possession or an immediate right to possession of the LC documents and, in turn, the goods;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">(ii) that the Bansals did not deal with the LC documents, and the goods; it was the staff of Natsyn who dealt with the documents;</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">(iii) the Bansals did not know that the documents belonged to CBI; and</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-List-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">(iv) there was no intent to convert since Natsyn subsequently made partial payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">22 It is clear that conversion may be committed in many ways, the most obvious being to wrongfully take possession, dispose of, or destroy the goods belonging to or in the possession of another. In all cases, the essential element is that of dealing with the goods of another person in such a manner as to constitute an unjustifiable denial of his rights in them or the assertion of rights inconsistent therewith. It is settled law that for a plaintiff to be entitled to sue for conversion he must have actual possession or an immediate right to possession of the goods in question: see <i>Siew Kong Engineering Works (sued as a firm) v Lian Yit Engineering Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1993] 2 SLR 505</nobr>, and <i>Winfield &amp; Jolowicz on Tort (15<sup>th</sup> Edition)</i> at 597. This was the very point which the Bansals argued that CBI had not established.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">23 The undisputed evidence was that CBI negotiated the LC documents submitted by Bhagwati. This fact of negotiation was indicated by the CBI stamp on each document. Following the negotiation, CBI were entitled to the documents and in turn the goods. Subsequently, the documents were handed by CBI to Bhagwati. There was no evidence as to the reasons for the documents to be handed over to Bhagwati. Neither was there any evidence that Bhagwati, or for that matter any other person, had purchased the documents from CBI. So <i>prima facie</i>, notwithstanding that physical possession of the documents was with Bhagwati, ownership of the documents remained with CBI and CBI were entitled to the documents, and in turn the goods. There was nothing to indicate how the documents arrived at Natsyn. But Natsyn did use the documents to obtain delivery of the goods. Again, there was no evidence that Natsyn paid for the documents. On the contrary, after discovery by CBI of what happened, Natsyn made part payments towards the purchase, leaving outstanding the two sums, which were the subject of the present action. Thus, entitlement to the documents had always remained with CBI and they therefore had the right to immediate possession of the documents and, in turn, the goods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">24 Turning to the second point, what must be borne in mind was that the Bansals were the only shareholders and directors of Natsyn. So, they were the ones in charge of Natsyn. Since the Bansals did not come to court to testify, in the absence of any evidence indicating the contrary, it would be reasonable to infer that they had handled the documents that came into the possession of Natsyn and they had directed their staff to obtain or they had by themselves obtained, delivery of the goods with the documents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">25 The third argument concerned the question of knowledge. The Bansals said that they did not know that the documents belonged to CBI. We would make two observations on this. First, it did not matter whether the Bansals knew the documents belonged to CBI. The important thing was that the Bansals knew that the documents did not belong to Natsyn (as Natsyn had not paid for the documents) and nevertheless proceeded to use them to obtain delivery of the goods and dispose of them. By so obtaining and disposing of the goods, the Bansal intended to deny the rights of CBI to the documents. Second, the goods were to be paid for by way of the LCs, and, in the ordinary course of business, the LC documents would have come to Natsyn through the issuing banks. But here, the Bansals admitted that the documents came from Bhagwati. Putting it at the lowest, the Bansals would have known that Natsyn were not entitled to the documents and in dealing with the documents with such knowledge, they had committed conversion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">26 As for the fourth point, that the Bansals had not intended to convert the goods because Natsyn had made part payments, it must be rejected outright. Making amends, after the commission of a wrong, cannot erase the wrong although it would mitigate the damages payable. In this case, the material time to determine whether the tort of conversion had been committed was when the Bansals, on behalf of Natsyn, obtained the delivery of the goods with the documents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">27 In the premises, all the arguments raised by the Bansals on conversion failed. A <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out that the Bansals had dealt with the LC documents in a manner inconsistent with the rights of CBI and were thus liable for conversion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\" align=\"justify\">Constructive trust</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">28 The judge below also found that the Bansals had dishonestly assisted Bhagwati in committing a breach of trust. The Bansals argued that they had not committed such a wrong. First, there was no evidence of a trust being imposed on Bhagwati when the documents were handed by CBI to Bhagwati. Second, there was also no evidence to implicate them that they had dishonestly assisted Bhagwati to commit a breach of trust.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">29 The law on dishonest assistance was recently considered and elucidated by the Privy Council in <i>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Philip Tan Kok Ming</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 WLR 64</nobr> where an airline sought a remedy against a tour agent\u2019s principal director and shareholder. The defendant director was held liable for dishonest assistance in respect of a breach of trust committed by his company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">30 For a third party to be liable for dishonest assistance of a breach of trust, there must be first, a trust, second, a breach of the trust, third, assistance rendered by the third party towards the breach, and lastly, the assistance rendered by the third party must be dishonest. What the decision in <i>Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan</i> clarified is that in determining such accessory liability, the pre-requisite of dishonesty was to be judged objectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">31 From the facts which we have set out in \u00b623 above, it was clear that when CBI handed the LC documents to Bhagwati, an implied trust arose. This was because the documents belonged to CBI and there was no evidence that Bhagwati, or any third party, had paid CBI for the documents. <i>Prima facie</i>, a resulting trust arose in favour of CBI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">32 The next point is that when Bhagwati, without authority, passed the documents to Natsyn in Singapore, Bhagwati was acting in breach of trust, and as Natsyn had not paid for them, Natsyn would, in turn, be holding the documents as trustees for the rightful owner, CBI. In obtaining delivery of the goods by using the documents and then disposing of them, Natsyn had accordingly committed a breach of trust.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">33 As mentioned above, the Bansals were in complete charge of Natsyn. <i>Prima facie</i>, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it would be reasonable to infer that they were behind the actions of Natsyn and, were thus, accessories to the breach committed by Natsyn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">34 The main point of contention of the Bansals before us was that they had not dishonestly assisted Bhagwati in committing any breach of trust. They said that they had no knowledge of how the documents came into the hands of Bhagwati and neither was there any evidence that they have had a hand in transmitting the documents to Natsyn. That would appear to be so. But when Natsyn came into possession of the documents knowing full well that it had not paid for them, an implied trust arose in favour of the rightful owner. In using the documents to obtain the goods, the Bansals were thus guilty of assisting Natsyn in committing a breach of trust. In the circumstances of this case, the assistance rendered by the Bansals to Natsyn was clearly dishonest. Here, we would quote a passage from <i>Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan</i> where the Privy Council stated (at p.74-75):-</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">\"Acting in reckless disregard of others\u2019 rights or possible rights can be a tell-tale sign of dishonesty. An honest person would have regard to the circumstances known to him, including the nature and importance of the proposed transaction, the nature and importance of his role, the ordinary course of business, the degree of doubt, the practicability of the trustee or the third party proceeding otherwise and the seriousness of the adverse consequences to the beneficiaries. The circumstances will dictate which one or more of the possible courses should be taken by an honest person. He might, for instance, flatly decline to become involved. He might ask further questions. He might seek advice, or insist on further advice being obtained. He might advise the trustee of the risks but then proceed with his role in the transaction. He might do many things. Ultimately, in most cases, an honest person should have little difficulty in knowing whether a proposed transaction, or his participation in it, would offend the normally accepted standards of honest conduct.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"justify\">Likewise, when called upon to decide whether a person was acting honestly, a court will look at all the circumstances known to the third party at the time. The court will also have regard to personal attributes of the third party, such as his experience and intelligence and the reason why he acted as he did.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\">35 Natsyn had arranged for the goods to be paid by LCs. The Bansals, being experienced business persons in international trade, would have known that in the normal course of business, the LC documents would have come to them through the issuing banks, who would expect payment before the documents would be released to Natsyn. Natsyn had not paid for the documents and yet the Bansals proceeded to obtain delivery of the goods with the documents. They would have seen the CBI stamp on the documents. They were clearly not entitled to the documents until they paid for them. They would have known that something was amiss. There was no evidence that they made any inquiries. An honest person in similar circumstances would have made an effort to establish how the documents could have come into his possession when no payment had yet been made. In our opinion, in the absence of any explanation offered, it would be reasonable to infer that the Bansals had acted dishonestly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">36 In our judgment, CBI had established a <i>prima facie</i> case that the Bansals had committed the wrong of dishonest assistance. It would be seen that the only aspect on which we differed from the trial judge is that we were of the opinion that the dishonest assistance rendered by the Bansals was not in relation to the breach of trust by Bhagwati but by Natsyn. This was because there was nothing to indicate that the Bansals had a hand in the breach committed by Bhagwati.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\" align=\"justify\"/>\n\n<p class=\"Judg-1\">37 Accordingly, the appeal of the Bansals must fail.</p>\n</body>\n</html></mainContent></searchResponse>\n"]
